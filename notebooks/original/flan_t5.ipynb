The program, among other things, referred to the claim that two soldiers of “Berkut”, who refused to kneel in front of Lviv Maydan and recognize the current government, allegedly were burned alive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDH0Qbjuao This was reported by the head of the so-called Russian community of Dnepropetrovsk Victor Trukhov. He says, two “Berkut” solders were put on their knees publicly and then burned in Lviv. However, contrary to this claim, a fire occured in Lviv on February 20, 2014 where people from security forces were caught in a fire. The fire started after a powerful explosion in the security forces basis, after which one officer in uniform and one in civilian clothes were pulled from the rubble. Commandos from “Berkut” kneeled on 24 February. Lviv citizens who came to the Maydan, were shouting “Shame!” and throwing small objects at security forces. To prevent any possible violence against “Berkut” soldiers, Self-Defense soldiers surrounded “Berkut”, and the priest was calming down people. \\xa0 People made the security forces to kneel on stage, and then one of the special forces soldier promised that “Berkut” will always be on the side of the people and assured that Lviv “Berkut” was not involved in the fighting in Kyiv. After the “ceremony” the commandos were taken away in the tram. Accordingly, the fire was the result of an accident and not the result of public humiliation of “Berkut”.',\n",

              "  'doc': 'President Joe Biden was in Michigan’s auto industry hub on Oct. 5 when he said, \"the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric.\" Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, had a quick response, writing on Twitter: \".@POTUS no it’s not — in fact, your own administration published a study concluding 4/5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels ... \"It’s past time Biden lives up to his promise to expand clean-burning #biofuels. Don’t mess with the RFS!\" Feenstra is correct about the share of cars in the United States projected to use liquid fuels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2021 Annual Energy Outlook report, which projects the nation’s environmental plans through 2050, says about 79% of new vehicle sales will be powered by liquid fuels — gasoline and blends that include up to 85% ethanol — in 2050. They accounted for 95% of sales in 2020, the report states. PolitiFact contacted Feenstra’s communications staff over 10 times for comment but did not receive a response. However, Feenstra’s tweet shared the link to his sourcing, and on page 15, the federal report notes that, while electric energy’s biggest demand growth area is transportation, the share will be small — less than 3%: \"Current laws and regulations are not projected to induce much market growth, despite continuing improvements in electric vehicles (EVs) through evolutionary market developments. Both vehicle sales and utilization (miles driven) would need to increase substantially for EVs to raise electric power demand growth rates by more than a fraction of a percentage point per year.\" And, on the report’s page 26: \"Because most light-duty vehicles have internal combustion engines, motor gasoline remains the major transportation fuel through 2050 as personal travel returns to pre-pandemic per-driver levels in the longer term.\" While 2050 is 29 years down the road, Biden did not state in Michigan a time limit on when he thinks electric power would come close to liquid fuels’ share of the automobile market. Nor did he state in detail what that future for electric power for automobiles would be. His administration’s Annual Energy Outlook reports that it is not predicting future energy use; rather it is a projection based on assumptions and methodologies that can be changed when subjected to changes in technology, demographics and resources. The report also notes that it is a response to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. That law requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration to produce annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply, the report notes. But Feenstra was precise with his facts, and is not alone reminding Biden to support biofuels. Other Iowa congressional members, Republican and Democrat, have pushed for biofuels support, regardless of who is president. So has the biofuels industry. The reason? Iowa leads the nation when it comes to producing biofuels from farm crops. It has capacity to produce 4.6 billion gallons, double the 2.3 billion in the No. 2 state, Nebraska. While we focused this story on predicted biofuels use in vehicles, it’s worth noting that Biden promised support for biofuels in a Sept. 9, 2020, campaign statement that criticized a pre-election policy reversal by then-President Donald Trump on biofuels. Trump’s reversal led to his administration’s rejection of oil refinery industry requests to be exempt from requirements to blend certain amounts of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline: \"A Biden-Harris Administration will fight for family farmers and revitalize rural economies — from keeping our promises to farmers by ushering in a new era of biofuels, to investing in the broadband infrastructure and rural health care access that families and communities need,\" the Biden statement read. Trump reversed course again and approved on Jan. 19, 2021, just before leaving office, three biofuel waivers for refineries. Feenstra said the Biden Administration predicts that four out of five new cars on the road will require liquid fuels in 2050 and he cites the source. That source, a report from the Biden Administration, states that 79% of vehicles on the road will require liquid fuels by 2050. We rate Feenstra’s statement to be True.',\n",

The program, among other things, referred to the claim that two soldiers of “Berkut”, who refused to kneel in front of Lviv Maydan and recognize the current government, allegedly were burned alive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDH0Qbjuao This was reported by the head of the so-called Russian community of Dnepropetrovsk Victor Trukhov. He says, two “Berkut” solders were put on their knees publicly and then burned in Lviv. However, contrary to this claim, a fire occured in Lviv on February 20, 2014 where people from security forces were caught in a fire. The fire started after a powerful explosion in the security forces basis, after which one officer in uniform and one in civilian clothes were pulled from the rubble. Commandos from “Berkut” kneeled on 24 February. Lviv citizens who came to the Maydan, were shouting “Shame!” and throwing small objects at security forces. To prevent any possible violence against “Berkut” soldiers, Self-Defense soldiers surrounded “Berkut”, and the priest was calming down people. \\xa0 People made the security forces to kneel on stage, and then one of the special forces soldier promised that “Berkut” will always be on the side of the people and assured that Lviv “Berkut” was not involved in the fighting in Kyiv. After the “ceremony” the commandos were taken away in the tram. Accordingly, the fire was the result of an accident and not the result of public humiliation of “Berkut”.')"

              " '[Claim]:The Biden administration \"published a study concluding 4 (of) 5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels.\"\\n[Evidences]:President Joe Biden was in Michigan’s auto industry hub on Oct. 5 when he said, \"the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric.\" Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, had a quick response, writing on Twitter: \".@POTUS no it’s not — in fact, your own administration published a study concluding 4/5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels ... \"It’s past time Biden lives up to his promise to expand clean-burning #biofuels. Don’t mess with the RFS!\" Feenstra is correct about the share of cars in the United States projected to use liquid fuels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2021 Annual Energy Outlook report, which projects the nation’s environmental plans through 2050, says about 79% of new vehicle sales will be powered by liquid fuels — gasoline and blends that include up to 85% ethanol — in 2050. They accounted for 95% of sales in 2020, the report states. PolitiFact contacted Feenstra’s communications staff over 10 times for comment but did not receive a response. However, Feenstra’s tweet shared the link to his sourcing, and on page 15, the federal report notes that, while electric energy’s biggest demand growth area is transportation, the share will be small — less than 3%: \"Current laws and regulations are not projected to induce much market growth, despite continuing improvements in electric vehicles (EVs) through evolutionary market developments. Both vehicle sales and utilization (miles driven) would need to increase substantially for EVs to raise electric power demand growth rates by more than a fraction of a percentage point per year.\" And, on the report’s page 26: \"Because most light-duty vehicles have internal combustion engines, motor gasoline remains the major transportation fuel through 2050 as personal travel returns to pre-pandemic per-driver levels in the longer term.\" While 2050 is 29 years down the road, Biden did not state in Michigan a time limit on when he thinks electric power would come close to liquid fuels’ share of the automobile market.

            "[Evidences]:Did Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman claim the government distributed 35,000 crore LED bulbs under the Ujala scheme? This would imply the Modi govt gave about 300 bulbs to every person in India. At least this is what is being claimed by some social media users who are sharing a screenshot from a news segment on business channel CNBC Awaaz. The photo shows Sitharaman delivering her budget speech while a caption at the bottom reads - \"35,000 crore LED bulb baantein gaye\" (35,000 crore LED bulbs were distributed). The snapshot gives the impression that Sitharaman said this sentence in her speech. Netizens are displaying shock at this whopping number believing that the finance minister's statement is true. Some Congress leaders are also trolling her by sharing the screenshot of the news channel. But, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that Sitharaman never said that 35,000 crore LED bulbs were distributed in the country in her speech. In fact, she said that approximately 35 crore LED bulbs were distributed under the Ujala scheme. Among many who have shared the news channel's screenshot is Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza who tweeted the picture. Her tweet was retweeted more than 350 times and had over 1,500 likes by the time of writing this story. Former Cabinet Minister in Haryana government, Mahender Pratap Singh also trolled Sitharaman, believing the news to be true. There are some more verified social media users who have shared the same image of the news channel. 125 35000 LED - 280 .. , ...? pic.twitter.com/p8JKRWrMPb Sachin Chaudhary (@SChaudharyINC) July 6, 2019 Every Indian after receiving 300 LED bulbs each, as claimed by Dumb Sitharaman !!

The text speech of the budget also reads \"approximately 35 crore LED bulbs\", and not \"35,000 crore LEDs\". Website of UJALA also states that till July 6, more than 35 crore LEDs have been distributed in the country. A senior editor at CNBC Awaaz spoke to us and confirmed that the wrong figure was aired due to a typo which was corrected when noticed. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim In her budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman claimed that the Government distributed 35,000 crore LED bulbs in the country. Conclusion Sitharaman never said this in the budget speech. She stated that about 35 crore LED bulbs were distributed under UJALA scheme.

            "Original:  [Claim]:Amit Shah said Narendra Modi sleeps for 24 hours for the welfare of the poor.\n",
            "[Evidences]:The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room found the viral video of Amit Shah's statement was clipped and presented out of context. A short video clip of Union Home Minister Amit Shah has gone viral with the claim that at a political rally, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sleeps 24 hours for the welfare of the poor. Several Twitter and Facebook users shared this video clip with captions like, “Modi ji sleeps for 24 hours”. The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room ( AFWA) found the viral video was clipped and presented out of context to give it a different meaning. In the original video, Shah can be heard saying that PM Modi thinks about the welfare of the poor 24 hours a day while “Didi” (Mamta Banerjee) wonders when her nephew would become the Chief Minister. Shah made the statement while addressing a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal, in April 2021. The viral posts are archived here, here, and here. AFWA probe With the help of keywords searches, we discovered that the same video along with the same claim had made the rounds of social media in 2021 as well. We found the original video on the official Bharatiya Janata Party YouTube channel. It was uploaded on April 17, 2021. The title of the YouTube video read, “HM Shri Amit Shah addresses public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal.” At the 5.34-minutes mark, one can hear the unedited version of the portion of the speech that went viral. In the original video, Shah was talking about the Trinamool Congress-led government in West Bengal. Shah said “This is a government for the welfare of the nephew... Modi ji thinks about the welfare of the poor, 24 hours a day. And Didi thinks about when her nephew will become Chief Minister, 24 hours a day.” Instead of “sote” (sleep), Shah said “sochte” (thinks) in the original video. But the video was clipped to change the meaning of the sentence altogether. Thus, an old clipped video of Amit Shah has gone viral with a misleading claim. (With inputs from Sanjana Saxena) INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Amit Shah said Narendra Modi sleeps for 24 hours for the welfare of the poor. Conclusion The viral video is clipped. In the original video, Shah says PM Modi thinks about the welfare of the poor, 24 hours a day, while “Didi” (Mamata Bannerjee) wonders when her nephew would become CM. Shah was addressing a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal, in April 2021.

            "[Evidences]:\"80 doctors in Canada between the ages of 25 and 55 have died in the last 60 days,\" says text above a video shared in a December 21, 2022 Instagram post from Michelle Lindsay, a leader for the People's Party of Canada in Halifax who ran for Parliament in 2021. Other posts sharing the same video can be found on Instagram -- the latest in a series of unproven claims attempting to tie the deaths of Canadian doctors to Covid-19 shots. The posts do not identify the speaker in the video, but AFP searched the phrase \"80 Canadian doctors died\" and found a tweet indicating the man is Chris Shoemaker, a family doctor in Ontario who regularly posts videos making inaccurate claims about Covid-19 vaccinations. The video was filmed at a protest in Toronto on October 22, 2022 and has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Rumble, Bitchute and Odysee. It resurfaced in December, amid a surge in anti-vaccine claims following interest in the misinformation-laden film \"Died Suddenly\" which AFP debunked here. In the clip, Shoemaker claims: \"80 doctors in Canada between the ages of 25 and 55 have died in the last 60 days and it's only the physicians who are getting third and fourth shots who are dying suddenly.\" Most Canadian health care workers were mandated to receive Covid-19 vaccines under provincial regulations or by their employers, but Health Canada called Shoemaker's claim \"misinformation.\" \"Claims that 80 Canadian doctors died because of Covid-19 vaccines are unsubstantiated,\" it said in a statement emailed on January 4, 2023. \"Immunization is one of the most important ways to protect the health of people in Canada and around the world\" the statement continued, pointing to the success of Covid-19 vaccines in preventing \"thousands of hospitalizations and deaths.\" The Public Health Agency of Canada publishes regular reports on adverse events following immunization and the latest data (up to December 9, 2022), did not identify any new safety signals for the shots. Shoemaker does not offer a source for his claim, but keyword searches bring up links to articles published by outlets identified for spreading false information, including The Epoch Times and Druthers, a print publication the Canadian Anti-Hate Network found to be devoted to Covid conspiracies. A November 2022 Druthers story headlined \"80 Canadian doctors VAXXED and dead\" was written by Mark Trozzi, an Ontario doctor who has been referred to the Discipline Tribunal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario for allegedly \"making misleading, incorrect or inflammatory statements about vaccinations, treatments and public health measures for Covid-19.\" The story cites a letter sent by William Makis to the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) in which he says he compiled a database of physician deaths, basing his figures in part on obituaries published on the CMA's website. Makis, who was involved in a long legal battle with Alberta Health Services over his termination, also made the claim in an interview with Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, a former co-host of the Christian news program The 700 Club Canada. She has used her social media and live events across Canada to give a platform to doctors including Makis, Shoemaker and Roger Hodkinson who speak out against the Covid-19 vaccines and other measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease. The Canadian Medical Association called claims about recent physician deaths \"conspiracy theories\" and told AFP in a December 13 email: \"There is no evidence to confirm or support the various theories that have been circulated.\" It said the In Memoriam section of its website \"should never be viewed as an exhaustive list of physicians' deaths or as evidence to support conspiracies surrounding the Covid-19 vaccines or other issues.\" AFP reviewed obituaries and news reports about the deaths of all 80 doctors pictured in Druthers and none mentioned vaccination as a cause of death. Contrary to Shoemaker's claim, the doctors included had died as far back as December 2020 -- not within the last 60 days -- and 37 of the individuals were older than age 55. In 12 of the obituaries, cancer was cited as the cause of death, including one man who had been diagnosed withHodgkin's Lymphoma years prior to the pandemic. Medical experts previously told AFP that Covid-19 vaccines are not linked to an uptick in cancer deaths. One death was attributed to \"an ongoing battle with mental illness,\" one to a childhood heart defect, while two of the individuals died in accidents -- drowning and a car crash. In one of the earliest iterations of claims about Canadian doctors, the Gateway Pundit -- a website AFP has regularly fact-checked for spreading Covid misinformation -- said in a July 2022 story that three doctors, Lorne Segall, Stephen McKenzie, and Jakub Sawicki, \"died suddenly,\" linking their passing to the hospital where they worked administering fourth Covid shots to staff. This claim was debunked by Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga on Twitter. \"The rumour circulating on social media is simply not true. Their passings were not related to the Covid-19 vaccine,\" it said on July 27, 2022. All three men had cancer. CTV spoke with Iris Sawicki, the wife of Jakub Sawicki, who said he had been fighting aggressive stomach cancer since August 2021. An obituary for Segall said he too had been fighting cancer for a year, while McKenzie's obituary, published in The Globe and Mail, said he lost a \"courageous battle with cancer.\" More of AFP's reporting on vaccine misinformation is available here.\n",

            "[Evidences]:It’s not an easy time to be a supporter of the health care law. There’s rage at every turn, for the millions of policy cancellation notices in Americans’ mailboxes, for the faulty online marketplace, and for President Barack Obama’s leadership in general. David Axelrod, Obama’s former campaign strategist and adviser, tried batting down the dearth of bad press with some positive statistics about the law Thursday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The law allows young adults under 26 to stay on their parents’ plan, prohibits insurers from refusing coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and eliminates lifetime caps, Axelrod said. Plus, \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\" Shortly after his segment, Axelrod took to Twitter and said he was talking about rebates sent in 2013. We wanted to know if his point is accurate. You’re probably wondering who got free money from their insurance companies, and why, because it likely wasn’t you. One of the health care law’s many requirements demands health insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of each dollar they charge in premiums on medical care, not for administrative purposes. Policy wonks know it as the medical loss ratio, or the 80/20 rule (for larger employers, it’s more like the 85/15 rule, but that’s more than we need to know for this fact-check). Some Americans know it as the way they got paid by their insurer. If a company spends less than 80 percent on medical services, it must return the difference to the consumer either as a cash payment or as a reduction in future payments. Two-thirds of insurance companies were already meeting the ratio without a policy change, according to a 2011 Government Accountability Office study, though compliance varied upon policy type. For example, 77 percent of companies that sold to large employers with more than 100 employees met the 80/20 rule, while only 43 percent of companies serving customers in the individual market were in compliance. The ratio does not apply to self-funded plans. Insurance companies had to report their premiums and spending for the first time in 2011. Companies returned $1.1 billion in total rebates to 13.1 million policyholders in 2012, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Companies returned about half as much in rebates in 2013 to 8.85 million policyholders (Axelrod was citing the agency’s original estimate of 8.5 million recipients). The average rebate was $98. So Axelrod is on somewhat solid ground here. But there’s a caveat. While 8.85 million policyholders were due rebates, it doesn’t mean people are getting checks as Axelrod claimed. Our colleagues at PolitiFact pointed this out in a statement from Obama over the summer. (Obama also tried to put a dollar amount on the checks, which led to a rating of Half True.) About one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013 (the proportion was about the same in 2012). That means they physically got a check. The rest of the rebates went to the small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees. Employers and employees often share the cost of health insurance, with employers picking up the bulk of the cost. In those cases, the rebate goes to the employer because they buy the insurance. But the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. Employers can pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by \"applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,\" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. Again, the rebates came but they doesn’t mean it trickled down to policyholders in the form of a check. Our ruling Axelrod said, \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\" He is correct on the number of rebates. However, like Obama before him, Axelrod’s claim isn’t clear on the fact that these checks are mostly going to employers who run plans for their workers, not individual Americans. Employers can then choose to pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by \"applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,\" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. We rate the statement Mostly True.\n",

But click on it, and you found no information — just a visual insult in the form of a picture of a gorilla with his middle finger raised. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) It’s was a hoax. The federal government in March began sending a third round of economic relief checks to Americans — up to $1,400 each — to help offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some lawmakers are pushing for a fourth round of direct payments, nothing has been decided. In a press conference on June 3, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that President Joe Biden is \"open to a range of ideas\" dealing with stimulus checks and his American Jobs and Families Plan. \"But he’s also proposed what he thinks is going to be the most effective for the short term,\" she added. The $1,400 checks were part of the American Rescue Plan Act enacted in March. The federal government this month began issuing advance payments to families under an expanded child tax credit provision that was part of the same legislation. The Facebook post said that stimulus checks will be given out by the end of the month and includes a link promising more information. The link goes to a page with a picture of a gorilla. A fourth stimulus check is being considered, but it has not been implemented. The post was a hoax. We rate its claim Pants on Fire!\n",

            "[Evidences]:Listen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “We are still sending about $100 million every month to Russia to buy uranium.” — Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), interviewed on Fox News, April 13 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “In 2021 Russian imports [of uranium] cost almost $1 billion, money that helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war machine.” — Barrasso, in an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal, April 12 The Biden administration has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, including eliminating preferential trading privileges and banning imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal. So we were surprised to hear these numbers from Barrasso — that Russia received nearly $1 billion for uranium products in 2021 and is on track to earn $1.2 billion this year. The uranium is generally used as fuel to generate electricity in nuclear power plants. Advertisement Barrasso, the senior Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, represents Wyoming, which has uranium mines that would benefit from a ban on Russian uranium. In fact, the domestic uranium mining industry has all but come to a halt, with production falling to an all-time low in 2019, as nuclear energy increasingly has relied on imports. That constituency might have made Barrasso a suspect source, though we have found that he does not routinely make up his numbers. It turns out that it was unexpectedly hard to land on a solid answer. Different government agencies churn out data that cannot easily be added together. Moreover, uranium does not trade on an open market like other commodities, so buyers and sellers negotiate contracts privately. Barrasso’s number is difficult to verify and appears somewhat exaggerated. But he may be in the ballpark. The Facts Readers may remember a controversy concerning the sale of a Canadian company called Uranium One during the Obama administration to a Russian state-owned company called Rosatom. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a minor role in its approval, but during the 2016 presidential campaign, opponents falsely claimed the deal involved 20 percent of the U.S. uranium supply. Advertisement Not so. Uranium One represented just a tiny part of U.S. production. Rosatom was much more interested in the company’s holdings in Kazakhstan, the world’s leading uranium producer. In 2021, Rosatom sold all of its shares in the U.S. subsidiary. In 2020, Canada just barely held its position as the No. 1 supplier of uranium to owners and operators of U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors, just ahead of Kazakhstan, according to the Energy Information Administration. Both countries supplied about 22 percent of the uranium purchased from abroad, while Russia was in third place, with 16 percent. That’s a much higher percentage than products that have already been banned; 5 percent of U.S. coal imports and 8 percent of petroleum products come from Russia. When we first studied EIA’s data, we realized it suggested the value of Russian uranium in 2020 was just $207 million. (EIA showed 8.054 million pounds of Russian uranium was purchased at an average price of $25.73 in 2020.) That’s much lower than $1 billion. Advertisement But then it turned out that the EIA numbers reflect the contracts for natural uranium in the nuclear fuel chain that were entered into by U.S. civilian nuclear power reactor operators during a calendar year. In other words, this uranium may already be in the United States, may arrive in the country in future years, or may never physically ever arrive in the United States as material gets swapped at different points in the fuel chain. (These are “book transfers” because ownership in commodity markets is not the same as possession.) Natural uranium often includes a uranium concentrate known as yellowcake. But the EIA figures do not include a significant amount of enrichment services purchased from Russia or other Russia-based entities that operate in the uranium industry, according to Morgan Butterfield, an EIA spokesman. Before uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power, it must be enriched. (In between is another step in which the yellowcake is converted into uranium hexafluoride.) Advertisement So then we turned to a public database of trade statistics maintained by the International Trade Commission (ITC). In 1992, the Commerce Department suspended an investigation into whether Russia was undercutting the price of U.S. domestic uranium, and in exchange Russia agreed to limit its sales to agreed-upon levels. The deal has been extended several times, most recently in 2020 during the Trump administration. The new agreement, which continues through 2040, allowed Russia to hike the sales in the initial years of the new agreement, to up to 24 percent of enrichment demand, before reducing the ceiling to 15 percent starting in 2028. The higher limits in some years were intended to grandfather previous contracts. The Federal Register notice contained the trade code numbers, known as Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) statistical reporting numbers, for various types and forms of uranium, including enriched uranium. So we entered all of the codes in ITC’s public database. The search turned up a total of $645,489,213 in uranium imports from Russia for 2021, or 550,388 kilograms. That appeared to be lower than the 596,682 kilograms permitted in the extension of the anti-dumping agreement. Advertisement In 2016, the ITC database shows, the United States imported $1.033 billion in uranium, or 570,783 kilos. But then the value of imports dropped sharply as U.S. demand dropped. In 2020, for instance, about $568 million in Russian uranium was exported, or 452,947 kilograms. But this figure is not necessarily complete either. In a 2017 investigation of the uranium trade with Russia, the International Trade Commission pondered many of the same data sources that we consulted and concluded that “trade in natural uranium cannot be simply added to trade in enriched uranium to obtain a meaningful statistic, except possibly by value.” We also contacted members of the Ad Hoc Utilities Group (AHUG), a trade group of nuclear energy companies, to see if they would reveal how much they plan to pay this year to Russia for uranium products. Most refused to answer, but Suzanne Hosn, a spokeswoman for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, said the company has most of the fuel it needs for now. “We are evaluating options for the small amount of fuel supply we need given the current international situation,” she said. Advertisement So how does Barrasso come up with nearly $1 billion for imports of Russian uranium products in 2021 and $1.2 billion this year? Brian Faughnan, a spokesman for the minority staff of the Energy committee, provided a screenshot of a webpage showing U.S. sales for Rosatom’s subsidiary Techsnabexport, generally known as TENEX, which exports nuclear fuel cycle products. The website page has since been deleted, and no archived page appears to exist. The webpage indicated that TENEX had $784 million sales in “America” in 2020 and 99 percent of those sales were in uranium products. So that would be about $775 million, a higher figure than the $568 million shown in the ITC database for enriched uranium sales from Russia that year. Presumably, the TENEX sales figures combined enriched and natural uranium sales — something that supposedly could not be gleaned from government data. It’s probably just a coincidence, but if you combine the $207 million in the EIA accounting of natural uranium sales in 2020 and the $568 million in ITC database for other uranium product sales in 2020, you end up with exactly $775 million. Advertisement Fletcher Newton, president of TENEX-USA, declined to comment, saying the information is confidential. Faughnan said the 2020 numbers on the webpage were used to estimate Russia’s uranium sales in 2021. Russia supplied 16 percent of uranium in 2020, according to the EIA, and was permitted to supply up to 24 percent in 2021, so that would be a 50 percent increase, he said. So the TENEX sales figure was increased by 50 percent, resulting in a calculation of $1.2 billion in 2021. This math appears to be a bit fuzzy. The EIA figures focus on natural uranium, not enriched uranium. Moreover, in 2020, Russian enriched uranium imports were limited to as much as 20 percent, or even higher, not 16 percent. So the numbers are apples and oranges. According to the screenshot, “America” makes up 36 percent of TENEX’s 2020 revenue total of $2.1 billion. It does not make sense for the U.S. revenue to increase so much when the quota goes only from 20 percent to 24 percent. Advertisement Moreover, another U.S. company, Centrus Energy, markets Russian nuclear fuel and could account for one-third of the Russian enriched uranium trade. Confusingly, in the Wall Street Journal, Barrasso wrote that Russian uranium imports were “almost $1 billion” in 2021. Then a day later he said on Fox that imports were a $100 million a month in 2022, or $1.2 billion. But under the logic presented by Faughnan, Russian uranium sales in 2022 should decline because the anti-dumping deal limits imports to 20 percent, a reduction from 24 percent in 2021. Faughnan did not respond to emails requesting an explanation of this discrepancy. We noticed that at a March 31 Senate Energy Committee hearing that Barrasso attended, Scott Melbye, president of the Uranium Producers of America, testified that “more than $1 billion per year in nuclear fuel purchases are flowing from the United States to Rosatom.” He told The Fact Checker that the number for what he called “blood uranium” could be as high as $1.3 billion. He said it was also calculated by assuming Russia in 2021 hit the 24 percent export target. But he acknowledged “this isn’t a precise estimate.” Since the TENEX document shows that its sales in 2020 were about 36 percent higher than the official trade figures, perhaps a better approach would be to increase the 2021 trade numbers by a similar percentage. That yields an estimate of $880 million in 2021. That’s much less than $1.2 billion, but relatively close to the “almost $1 billion” figure Barrasso used in his Wall Street Journal article. Another complicating factor, noted by both Faughnan and Melbye, is that much of the uranium from Kazakhstan travels through Russia before it is exported to the United States. In 2020, Russia produced 38 percent of the worldwide supply of uranium hexafluoride, much of it from uranium from Kazakhstan. Russia also has 43 percent of global enrichment capacity. There are other reasons to treat the figures with some skepticism. Jessica Sondgeroth, a reporter for Nuclear Intelligence Weekly, said that U.S. utilities often swap converted uranium for enrichment services provided by TENEX. Before the recent extension of the anti-dumping agreement, if the swapped converted uranium was enriched in Europe, it was then designated as a European product. Now it’s treated as “Russian-origin, even if it never spent any time in Russia, simply because it is a part of that transaction with Rosatom’s TENEX,” she said. “That puts a bigger restriction on Russian imports in 2021 compared with 2020.” The Pinocchio Test We found this to be a fascinating exploration, but we hope readers do not think we left them with a shaggy dog story. Barrasso’s figures are probably exaggerated, especially claiming $100 million in sales a month, and his math does not make much sense. But getting a handle on the actual number is wildly complicated. Saying Russia earned “nearly $1 billion” for uranium sales to the United States in 2021 is probably good enough for government work. It’s certainly an astonishing figure that is worth noting, given the many other sanctions on Russia. Given the difficulty of reaching a firm conclusion, we will leave this unrated.

Christopher “Bong” Go succeeds him, and that this has the backing of China. This statement is manufactured. Nowhere in Duterte’s speeches has he made this pronouncement about his long-time aide, and neither has it been reported by the media. The untrue graphic, which a reader requested VERA Files Fact Check to look into, consisted of a photo of Duterte and the statement: “Sisiguraduhin ko na s’ya (Bong Go) ang magiging kasunod ko sa pagka-Pangulo. Gagawin ko ang lahat para hindi mailipat ang kapangyarihan sa iba lalo na sa mga dilaw na’yan put*ngin*ng oposisyon (I will make sure he will be my successor for the presidency. I’ll do everything I can to prevent the transfer of power to others, especially to the yellows, the opposition).” The fabricated quote, which has been circulating since March 12, also said: “100% ang suporta ng China sa kanya kaya dapat mga Pilipino sumunod na lang (China supports him 100% so Filipinos should just obey).” Also this week, another fake quote card on next year’s elections made the rounds on social media. It said Duterte would close voting precincts if Vice President Leni Robredo decides to run for the presidency. The fabricated quote card on Go and China’s support for his presidential bid surfaced a day after Duterte said in a speech on March 11 that the senator is aspiring to run for president. Go has said that the chief executive’s pronouncement was merely a joke, adding he has no plans to run for the position in 2022 but might change his mind if his former boss runs as his vice president. Among those who shared the fake posts were FB pages Confeermed, Amor Powers and Kwento mo sa Pagong, and several netizens, some of whom screen grabbed Confeermed’s post and re-uploaded it on their news feeds.

            "claim [Claim]: Rutte was trying to seize over 3000 farms to free land for immigrants.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Recycled RumorDid Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte try to \"seize over 3000 farms\" to \"free land for immigrants\" during the unsuccessful negotiations over immigration shortly before the government's collapse in July 2023? No, that's not true: The claim was first made on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News a year before Rutte conceded that the members of his coalition couldn't reach a consensus on new immigration policy proposals that, contrary to the rumor, aimed to tighten rules, not to relax them. There is no evidence of a plan to seize farms.The claim appeared in a 15-second video (archived here) published on TikTok on July 8, 2023. It contained what looked like a screenshot with a photo of a multi-lane highway filled with tractors, and text saying:Netherlands... Mark Rutte has been forced to resign as his party no longer has control and they can not rein in immigration. Rutte was trying to seize over 3000 farms to free land for immigrants.This is what the post looked like on TikTok at the time of writing:(Source: TikTok screenshot taken on Wed Jul 12 14:34:33 2023 UTC)Described as a \"veteran conservative on the European political scene\" by Reuters, Rutte has been the longest-serving Dutch prime minister. In the summer of 2023, his government consisted of a coalition of four parties: two center-right parties (VVD and the Christian Democratic Appeal party) and two centrist parties (the Democrats 66 and Christian Union).On July 7, 2023, the parties reached a stalemate over immigration laws, which led to the resignation of the cabinet.In 2022, the number of asylum applications in the Neverlands grew by more than a quarter of the previous year, reaching 47,991 petitions. According to the government's estimate, this figure may increase to 70,000 in 2023.Official resources say that the acceptance rate of 85 percent for first-time asylum seekers in the Netherlands is high \"compared to other EU countries.\"While it was Rutte who pushed for the new policy changes, they were not in favor of immigrants.Reuters reported that one of his suggestions was to make family members, including children, of refugees already in the Netherlands wait at least two years before they could come to the country.The Associated Press described two other of Rutte's ideas:Proposals reportedly included creating two classes of asylum -- a temporary one for people fleeing conflicts and a permanent one for people trying to escape persecution -- and reducing the number of family members who are allowed to join asylum-seekers in the Netherlands.There is no indication that the supposed seizure of \"over 3000 farms\" was a part of the discussed measures during the days leading up to the government's collapse.A search for the phrase \"Rutte to seize over 3000 farms\" with or without quotation marks across the past month's entries does not show any major media organizations reporting the purported \"news.\"A search for the keywords \"3000 boerderijen\" and \"immigranten\" (\"3000 farms\" and \"immigrants\") on the website of the Dutch Senate does not produce any results.A search for the same terms across pending bills on the website of the Dutch House of Representatives doesn't show anything either.The claim conflated two topics -- immigration and farmers' protests, which intensified in 2022 in response to a new policy aimed to reduce nitrogen emissions. Both are major themes in the European far-right agenda. They are not directly related.Logically, a British startup specializing in the analysis of disinformation, wrote that one of the public figures who promoted the narrative about the seizure of \"3000 farms\" was Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch activist once affiliated with the far-right group the Forum for Democracy (FVD.)On July 10, 2022, one year before the post that is the focus of this fact check was published, Vlaardingerbroek said the Dutch government was \"stealing\" the land from farmers during her appearance on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News, adding at the 3:55 mark:It is very clear that the government is not doing it because of the nitrogen crisis. They are doing this because they want these farmers' land, and they want it to house new immigrants.While the government did offer buyouts to the farmers, the policies still allowed people to make a different choice; for example, to modernize their farms, and the measures were decided separately from immigration policies.The farmers' protests were supported by former President Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, a far-right former presidential candidate in France. A report from The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism highlighted the strong influence of conspiracy theorists who capitalized on what started as a series of local rallies.Other Lead Stories fact checks about the farmers' protest can be found here.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: The emergency alert test on 23 April will involve replying to a text message and until you do the use of your phone will be limited.\n",
            "[Evidences]:A video is being shared on Facebook that makes several false claims about the UK Emergency Alerts service and its upcoming test on 23 April. The man in the video claims the alert is a \"text message\" you need to reply to, that \"the use of your phone is going to be limited [that day]\" if you do not reply. He implies that the alert will access data on your phone or install something, and that phone companies are breaching GDPR legislation by \"giving your number to another agency outside of your permission\". This is not an accurate description of what the national test involves. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What is the emergency alert service? Emergency Alerts is a new government service to warn people via their phones or tablets if there's a nearby \"danger to life\", for example in the case of severe flooding, fire or extreme weather. Only emergency services and government departments, agencies and public bodies dealing with emergencies will be able to send the alerts, with advice about how to stay safe during the emergency. The system is due to be tested across the UK on Sunday 23 April . The alert will appear on devices that use 4G or 5G networks and will appear as a notification and loud siren-like sound for up to 10 seconds. Misinformation about what data is being collected may lead to unnecessary alarm. In this case, it may cause people to opt out (as many online have claimed they have) and therefore risk not being warned about nearby dangers in future. Is the test in violation of GDPR? GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, and in the UK was implemented by the Data Protection Act 2018 . According to GOV.UK, it means : \"Everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow strict rules called 'data protection principles'.\" Generally speaking, the legislation dictates how personal data is used by organisations, businesses and the government. However, the Emergency Alert system does not use personal data to send an emergency alert. The government says : \"The system uses the cell tower your phone is connected to. When an alert is triggered, all towers in the area will broadcast the alert. \"To do this the Government does not need to know the specific location or personal data on your device.\" The Emergency Alerts service's privacy notice says : \"Emergency alerts are broadcast from mobile phone masts to every compatible phone and tablet within range. The sender does not need to know your mobile phone number or any other personal data to send you an alert. \"No one will collect or share data about you, your phone or your location when you receive an emergency alert.\" So your phone network provider has not breached GDPR \"by giving your number to another agency outside of your permission\", as the video claims, because the alerts are simply sent to phones that are connected to cell towers, not via a list of numbers that networks have given the government. Do you need to 'reply' to the alert? The man in the video also claims: \"So you're going to receive a text message on your phone. If you don't reply to that text message, basically, the use of your phone is going to be limited so they're going to put your phone off for the day.\" You won't need to reply to the emergency alert. According to the government : \"It will appear on your device's home screen and you must acknowledge it before you can use other features. They appear as a notification and may include telephone numbers or website links containing further information.\" So you won't need to \"reply\" as such, but you will need to acknowledge the alert by pressing 'ok' before you can use your phone again. On whether use of your phone will be limited, the Cabinet Office confirmed to Full Fact that phone calls won't go to voicemail if you haven't acknowledged the alert. It won't stop a phone call in progress, and notifications will still come through. In order to answer a call or view notifications, however, you will first have to acknowledge the alert. Will the alert collect data? The man in the video claims: \"by the nature of the fact that you reply or you open something that then allows them to access elements to your phone.\" The Cabinet Office confirmed to Full Fact that the emergency alert in no way accesses or uses personal data and that no personal data is collected.

            "[Evidences]:In his third State of the Union address, President Trump claimed that since he took office:\"7 million Americans have come off of food stamps and 10 million have been lifted off of welfare.\" There is some data to back him up when it comes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, but our analysis found that the data is flawed. In addition, we could not substantiate his claim that 10 million people have been lifted from welfare. There are around 7 million fewer Americans participating in SNAP, sometimes called food stamps, than when Trump entered the White House, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. The program provides \"nutritional assistance\" to people with low incomes or disabilities. That’s what the data shows, but there are some issues. The real number is likely a bit lower due to two things: A data reporting problem in North Carolina and a reporting discrepancy from the 2018-19 government shutdown. SNAP participation numbers by state show there are no North Carolina recipients being accounted for from October 2017 through all of 2019, dragging down the national average of recipients. (In 2018, the News and Observer reported that North Carolina's food stamp numbers were too good to be true.) During the winter 2019 government shutdown, the federal government asked states to issue double the amount of SNAP benefits in January so enrollees would not miss their February benefits if the shutdown continued. (It lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019.) Because of this, numbers for January 2019 are consistent with the number of people receiving food stamps in prior months. But February 2019’s numbers show a huge drop, which also drags down the average. With all this being accounted for, the number of reductions may be closer to 6 million. Also, SNAP participation was falling since before Trump took office, a trend that experts say is likely due to a growing economy. Participation in the program usually follows along with the official poverty rate, which has been falling since 2010. Meanwhile, the administration finalized a rule in late 2019 that tightens guidelines on who can receive benefits and for how long. The changes are expected to move more \"able-bodied\" adults into the workforce, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a news release. The rule was projected to end benefits for about 700,000 people. RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's 2020 State of the Union address Trump’s claim that 10 million people were lifted \"off of welfare\" doesn’t add up. We didn’t hear back from the White House when we asked about this claim. One key problem is that \"welfare\" is an imprecise term. Besides SNAP, we reviewed the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and its Separate State Maintenance of Effort. Under TANF, the federal government provides a block grant to states, which use the funds to operate their own assistance programs. When Trump took office in January 2017, there were about 3.68 million recipients of these programs combined. In June 2019, that number dropped by about 825,000 to 2.85 million. The Center for Law and Social Policy, an advocacy organization for low-income people, told us it’s hard to determine how Trump arrived at the 10 million number. Elizabeth Lower-Basch, director of the organization’s income and work supports team, said it couldn’t be the TANF caseloads, as those numbers are much too low. \"It’s possible the administration could get to 10 million by combining reductions in TANF with reductions in the use of Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), but we haven’t seen any published data that show this figure,\" Lower-Basch wrote in an email. Most people think of \"welfare\" as a program for people who are not working, Lower-Basch said. In that respect, Medicaid, CHIP and SNAP don’t necessarily fit into that category as the vast majority of people who are getting these types of benefits are children, seniors, or working adults. Trump said, \"Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.\" Trump’s claim that 7 million Americans have come off food stamps since he took office isn’t too far off, although some discrepancies in reporting show slightly skewed data. The decline is also likely due to both the growing economy and the administration’s policy changes that have affected eligibility for some groups. But his broad welfare claim overshoots actual caseloads and appears to include programs that provide benefits to children and seniors as well as working adults. We rate this Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: After a “major water main break,” Georgia election workers counted “18,000 ballots, all for Biden” that they pulled from suitcases and with no election observers present.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In an hour-long phone call pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to overturn the results of the election, President Donald Trump rehashed the debunked claim that election workers in Atlanta were caught on tape secretly counting \"suitcases\" full of fraudulent ballots behind closed doors. State and county officials have said the surveillance video Trump mentioned shows normal ballot processing. But Trump stood by his inaccurate version of events during the Jan. 2 call, which was first reported by the Washington Post. \"That was the tape that’s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else,\" Trump said to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, according to the recording. In Trump’s telling, the Nov. 3 tape showed that after a \"major water main break\" at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, where Fulton County election workers were counting ballots, \"everybody fled the area.\" With Republican election observers gone, the county’s election workers returned, Trump said. They reached under a table and pulled out \"suitcases or trunks\" full of ballots that were hidden there hours earlier, he said, and they secretly tallied \"18,000 ballots, all for (Joe) Biden.\" Trump’s story aligns with the false narrative that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team pushed when they introduced the tape during a Dec. 3 hearing with state legislators. What actually happened, according to Georgia and Fulton County officials, is much different. Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, has addressed the \"suitcases\" claim in social media postings, TV interviews, and press conferences since Dec. 4, when he tweeted that the video showed \"normal ballot processing.\" In a Jan. 4 press conference ahead of Georgia’s runoff Senate election, Sterling spent minutes rebutting Trump’s claim, which he called \"thoroughly debunked.\" The sequence of events he described lined up with what PolitiFact and multiple other fact-checkers have reported. In reality, the ballots seen in the surveillance footage were not in suitcases or trunks. They were in \"normal absentee ballot carriers,\" Sterling said. The ballots were removed from their envelopes while news media personnel and observers were still in the room, and there was no formal announcement for observers to leave. But some observers took off once the election workers responsible for cutting the envelopes open and verifying the ballots inside had finished their job and started packing up for the night. Workers tasked with scanning the ballots got instructions to keep going, and an independent monitor and investigator oversaw the ballot counting as it continued into the night, Sterling said. In an affidavit, Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state’s chief investigator, wrote that the state’s \"investigation and review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables.\" \"Around 10 p.m., with the room full of people, including official monitors and the media, video shows ballots that had already been opened but not counted placed in the boxes, sealed up, stored under the table,\" Watson wrote. \"When the counting continued into later in the night, those boxes were opened so that the ballots inside could then be counted.\" Sterling said he reviewed the full tape with a local reporter. \"The president’s legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and then from our point of view, intentionally misled the state Senate, voters and the people of the United States about this,\" Sterling said. There’s no evidence that the ballots counted on election night were \"all for Biden,\" as Trump claimed, and a state monitor disputed that 18,000 votes were tallied during that window. There’s also no connection between the \"suitcase\" allegation and a leak at State Farm Arena on Election Day. State Farm Arena reported that one room being used for ballot counting had been affected by a water leak at approximately 6 a.m., hours before the scene in question took place. Arena staff repaired the leak, which Sterling attributed to an overflowing urinal, in roughly two hours, according to the arena’s statement. No ballots were damaged, the arena said. The Trump campaign and White House did not immediately respond to our inquiries. Trump claimed a tape shows that after a \"major water main break\" in Georgia, election workers pulled out ballots stored in \"suitcases\" under a table and counted \"18,000 ballots, all for Biden\" with no election observers present. That’s wrong in multiple ways. State and county officials have repeatedly debunked this claim. The video in question does not show any wrongdoing, and there’s no evidence that the ballots shown were fraudulent or \"all for Biden.\" The water leak, which was sourced to a urinal, was unrelated.

            "claim [Claim]: Social media posts claim the U.S. Postal Service “says you should give mail in ballots at least 14 days roundtrip. So, if you plan to vote by mail, election day isn’t November 3. It’s October 20th.”\n",
            "[Evidences]:Election officials across the United States are preparing for a surge of mail-in ballots this fall, as fears about voting in-person on Nov. 3 continue amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But there are also fears about the mail-in voting process. Some are concerned, for example, that a crush of ballots dropped in the mail could result in delays in getting them to election offices and votes not being counted. Several popular posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter suggest people should allow \"at least 14 days roundtrip\" to ensure they can request, fill-out and send back their ballots on time. Some posts say the U.S. Postal Service recommends this two-week period. They also claim that Election Day is really Oct. 20, and not the official date, Nov. 3, for those who want to vote by mail. Here are two examples: Do people really need to allow so much time for mail-in voting? We set out on a fact check. Our research All voters should check with their state and local election officials about mail-in voting deadlines. We found, however, that some states give far more time than others for ballots to be received, which chips away at the premise there’s a fixed deadline for all Americans who vote-by-mail. In California, for example, election officials must accept mail-in ballots that arrive up to 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. That’s the result of a new law passed this year. In North Carolina, ballots are accepted three days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by that day. In Georgia, Hawaii, Connecticut and many other states, there’s no extension: ballots must arrive by the time polls close on Nov. 3. \"The most common state deadline for election officials to receive absentee or mail ballots is on Election Day when the polls close,\" the National Conference of State Legislatures says on its website. \"Some states, however, accept and count a mailed ballot if it is received after Election Day but postmarked prior to the election.\" Deadlines for all 50 states are listed on the NCSL website here. Social Media Claim ‘Misses The Mark’ Amber McReynolds, a national expert on election administration and Denver’s former elections director, said the social media posts present a blanket warning that might be accurate for some states, but wrong for others. Registered voters in seven states — California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado and Vermont, plus Washington D.C. — don’t have to request a mail-in ballot. They’ll automatically receive one in the mail several weeks ahead of the election, removing one hurdle and some time in the process, McReynolds noted. Voters in these states, and the dozens of others where people can request a mail-in ballot, can also return them at a drop box at designated locations to avoid concerns about postal service delays. In California, voters can also return their vote-by-mail ballots at any in-person voting location, said Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the state’s Secretary of State’s Office. \"To say Election Day is October 20th or it takes 14 days misses the mark,\" added McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote At Home Institute, which advocates for putting voters’ needs first. \"It’s not taking into account all of these other factors.\" That's not to say voters should wait until the last minute. Experts, including McReynolds, say people should make sure they are registered to vote, request a mail-in ballot as early as possible and return it well in advance of their state’s deadline. One of the social media posts claims \"tens of thousands\" of ballots went uncounted in 2016. That is correct. In May, The Washington Post reported that of the roughly 33.2 million mail ballots received and tabulated during the 2016 general election, approximately 1 percent weren’t counted. That would amount to about 332,000 ballots. The reasons for rejection included the lack of a matching signature, problems with the return envelope and missing the deadline, the Post reported. Response From Postal Service While the suggestion that Oct. 20 is the real vote-by-mail deadline is off base in several states, there is some truth to what the social media posts are saying about recommendations from the U.S. Postal Service. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the agency wrote: \"We recommend that jurisdictions immediately communicate and advise voters to request ballots at the earliest point allowable but no later than 15 days prior to the election date.\" It went on to say: \"The Postal Service recommends that domestic, non-military voters mail their ballots at least one week prior to their state’s due date to allow for timely receipt by election officials. The Postal Service also recommends that voters contact local election officials for information about deadlines.\" Many questions have been raised about the Postal Service’s financial challenges and whether it has the capacity to handle the load of mail-in ballots this fall. The agency said its financial condition \"is not going to impact our ability to process and deliver election and political mail.\" \"The Postal Service has ample capacity to adjust our nationwide processing and delivery network to meet projected Election and Political Mail volume, including any additional volume that may result as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" it said. McReynolds added that ballots represent a tiny fraction of the mail volume regularly handled by the postal service. Our rating Several widely-shared social media posts suggest that Election Day for Americans who want to vote-by-mail is really Oct. 20 and not the official date, Nov. 3. They also say the U.S. Postal Service recommends allowing \"at least 14 days roundtrip\" to ensure they can request, fill-out and send back their mail-in ballots on time. We found some of this is accurate, but not for all states. Some allow far more time for the receipt of mail-in ballots than others. Ballots are still counted in California, for example, 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. In many others, there’s no extension and ballots must be received on Election Day. But even in states that grant less time, voters have options. They can speed things up by using a ballot drop box or returning their ballot at in-person polling locations. Giving some credence to these posts, we found the U.S. Postal Service does recommend the early request of mail-in ballots. It says voters should do that as early as possible and no later than 15 days before the election. It also recommends returning those ballots at least a week early and contacting local election officials about deadlines. In the end, these social media posts stretch the truth by suggesting there’s a fixed deadline of Oct. 20 to vote-by-mail in the United States. The Postal Service and elections experts encourage voters to act early, but deadlines vary by state. We rate the overall claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n",

            "[Evidences]:U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich wants to put people back to work, but since the private sector has not had much success, he wants to prime the economic pump by spending public money on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.There’s plenty of demand out there, Kucinich told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto on Sept. 7, pointing to an American Society of Civil Engineers report identifying an immense need for infrastructure repairs and rebuilding.But where would the money come from? States and local governments don’t have those kinds of dollars, Kucinich rightly pointed out. But, the Ohio Democrat added, the federal government does.\"We just found out the other day that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations,\" he told Cavuto.That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. After all, how can anybody simply create $1.2 trillion out of nothing?Well, it turns out Kucinich was pretty much on the money, no pun intended.Let’s take the first part of his sentence, that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing.The \"Fed\" in this case is the Federal Reserve, our country’s central bank. It’s the job of the Fed to use monetary policy to keep inflation in check and to stimulate the economy to create jobs. It does this by buying and selling government-backed securities that either increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation.The Federal Reserve also serves as the lender of last resort to its member banks who are having liquidity problems and can’t go to other banks for short-term loans.With that in mind, let’s go back to 2008 and 2009 when the United States banking system was on the brink of disaster. Then-President George W. Bush created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, to buy up banks’ bad investments and later to infuse the institutions with badly needed capital. In Cleveland, PNC National Bank used TARP money to buy troubled National City.TARP, however, is not what Kucinich was talking about. TARP was orchestrated by the U.S. Treasury and used money borrowed from the sale of U.S. securities such as Treasury bills.Nor was he talking about the $800 billion stimulus package of 2009, much of which was in the form of tax cuts.Kucinich was talking about $1.2 trillion that the Federal Reserve had on loan, primarily to banks, at the peak of its emergency lending during the financial crisis. The figure comes from a Bloomberg News investigative story this past summer that analyzed detailed loan information released by the Federal Reserve.Indeed, many banks did get money. Morgan Stanley at $107.3 billion received the most, followed by Citigroup at $99.5 billion and Bank of America at $91.4 billion.The loans, however, were not handed out the way your bank down the street dispenses money, explained Walker Todd, former assistant general counsel to the Federal Reserve banks in Cleveland and New York City.Regular banks are limited in how much they can loan based on their access to money, be it deposits or other forms of financing. \"But the Fed, uniquely among institutions in our society, gets to create money out of thin air,\" Todd said.It does so by simply increasing the balance in a member bank’s account. No actual money is printed. It just shows up in the electronic ledger, new money that never existed before that’s now in circulation, boosting the aggregate money supply.Each bank, however, did have to put up assets as collateral in case the money wasn’t repaid. Some of those assets, according to Bloomberg, were junk bonds.Eventually, all the money was repaid, with interest. But according to Todd, rather than wipe the money off its books, the Federal Reserve chose to use much of it to further stimulate the economy by purchasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities on the open market. So that money remained in circulation.Finally, what about Kucinich’s claim that some of the $1.2 trillion went to foreign banks? Again, Kucinich was correct. Two of the several foreign banks getting help were Royal Bank of Scotland Plc at $84.5 billion and UBS AG of Switzerland at $77.2 billion. The Federal Reserve treats foreign banks operating in the United States the same as U.S. banks because they are all part of the same financial system.On a side note, even some companies, including General Electric, received emergency cash.So while Kucinich’s comment that \"the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks and some of them foreign banks so that they could stabilize their operations\" is a bit flip, maybe even pejorative, he was essentially correct in describing the unique money-creating capabilities of the Federal Reserve and how it was used.On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Nevada lawmakers have roundly criticized the U.S. Department of Energy after the agency revealed in court that they had secretly shipped one-half metric ton of radioactive plutonium into their state, confirming a journalist’s report in January 2019, though federal officials deny the claim. U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, a Democrat, said in a statement that she had put officials from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) “on notice” about the secrecy. “The Department of Energy (DOE) and NNSA negotiated in bad faith, hiding the timing of their shipment and refused to share crucial information with Members of Congress who had the security clearance to know,” her statement read. The U.S. government shipped around half a ton of the substance into Nevada in November 2018, a move first reported by journalist Dan Leone and confirmed in a court filing on 30 January 2019 by Bruce Diamond, the NNSA’s general counsel. The weapons-grade plutonium was shipped into the state just before Nevada state officials sued the DOE in federal court in December 2018 looking to block the move in the first place. At the time, the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects Executive Director Robert Halstead said that the DOE refused to share any information with the state, citing security reasons. “We’re going to be really pissed off if it turns out they snuck a shipment in here while they were engaged in what we thought were good faith negotiations,” he said. The revelation that the DOE proceeded with the shipment to a site about 70 miles north of Las Vegas before the matter was brought to federal Judge Miranda Du prompted state officials to double-down on opposing future waste shipments. Du is currently considering the state’s request to block such a move in the first place. “I am beyond outraged by this completely unacceptable deception from the U.S. Department of Energy,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said in a statement. “The [DOE] led the State of Nevada to believe that they were engaging in good-faith negotiations with us regarding a potential shipment of weapons-grade plutonium, only to reveal that those negotiations were a sham all along.” The DOE disputed accusations of impropriety in a statement, saying that it was “inaccurate to state” that lawmakers were not kept apprised of the shipment: The Department of Energy was as transparent as operational security would permit. Efforts were made to ensure that Members of Congress representing the states involved were notified of the planned movement ahead of time, as early as August 2018 when NNSA publicly released the plan in a Supplement Analysis. Since then, NNSA confirmed that it was “actively engaged” in removing one metric ton of plutonium from South Carolina to Nevada, Texas, and New Mexico. The NNSA had announced in November 2018 that Texas or Nevada was being considered as an alternative “staging point” for the plutonium following a separate court ruling ordering the agency to remove it from a facility in South Carolina. According to an NNSA report, the agency intended to use a location in each state as a temporary storage space until the material was taken to its final destination in New Mexico. Cortez Masto said that she “put NNSA officials on notice” regarding what she called a betrayal of trust on the part of the DOE against Nevadans, adding, “I’m fighting alongside Nevada’s congressional delegation, Attorney General Ford, and our Governor to hold them accountable and to find out when this plutonium will be removed.” It is unclear, however, what that effort could entail or whether the Nevada Legislature will take action of its own regarding the issue. We contacted both state Senate Majority Leader Kelvin Atkinson and Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson seeking comment but did not hear back prior to publication.\n",

            "[Evidences]:ABC’s This Week spent much of their show Sunday discussing race issues, from affirmative action to racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to economic disparity. During a roundtable segment on the difference between the middle class in the United States and Canada, Fusion reporter Alicia Menendez argued that differences in wealth aren’t just generational, they’re racial. \"We also know that there is a racial component to this, that a white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession,\" she said. PunditFact finds her ratio correct. Menendez pointed us to an April 2013 report from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social policy think-tank. The institute measured mean wealth by race. Using 2010 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Urban Institute looked at assets including cash savings, homes, retirement accounts and subtracted any debt. The Urban Institute concluded that, post-recession, for every $1 an average black or Hispanic person has in wealth, an average white person has $6. That’s up from 1983, the farthest back the study goes, when the ratio was 5-to-1. Thomas Shapiro, a Brandeis University social policy professor who studies the wage gap, said the 6-to-1 ratio is correct, but represents the lower end of the wealth gap range researchers have come up with. At the higher end of the spectrum, Pew Research cited a 20-to-1 ratio in 2011. They took median wealth from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation 2009 data. So the data varies by survey used, year and measure of average (mean vs median). There’s debate among economists and social scientists about which ratio is the most accurate. Darrick Hamilton, an urban policy professor at The New School, said the Census Bureau surveys more low-income families, while the Survey of Consumer Finances oversamples high-income families where minorities aren’t as well represented. Overall, any ratio from 6-to-1 to 22-to-1 could be considered an accurate measure of the wealth gap, Shapiro told us. Our ruling Menendez said, \"A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession.\" A study from the Urban Institute supports her statistic. Other research shows an even wider gap, further proving her point that race is a factor in U.S. wealth. Menendez's statement is accurate, and might even understate the issue. We rate her claim True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A viral post which we've seen circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp makes various claims about the cost to British taxpayers of asylum seeker benefits, benefit fraud and errors, and tax avoidance. While some are incorrect, others are in the right ballpark or need more context. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in Benefits for asylum seekers The post claims that benefits for asylum seekers cost taxpayers £60 million per year. It is unclear where this estimate comes from but it is too low. We asked the Home Office for the latest figures on the cost of providing cash and accommodation benefits to people seeking asylum. It directed us to its annual report which shows that the department spent £470 million on \"asylum costs\" in 2019/20. It also told us this included the costs of accommodation and cash support for people seeking asylum and management fees to external providers for the provision of these services, though excludes some other costs such as some grants provided to unaccompanied children seeking asylum. Benefit fraud and errors The post then says that benefit fraud and error costs £3 billion per year. This is in the right ballpark. The DWP estimates that each year it overpays £2.8 billion in benefits as a result of fraud, £1.1 billion as a result of error from the claimant, and £0.8 billion as a result of error from officials (for example by DWP, HMRC or local authorities). It also estimates that it underpays £1.3 billion as a result of claimant error and £0.7 billion as a result of errors from officials. It's unclear if the Facebook post has a specific type of error in mind when it talks about the cost of fraud and error, whether it is any type of error or specifically claimant error. If it's any type of error then the gross overpayment comes to £4.6 billion, while the net overpayment (overpayments minus underpayments) is around £2.6 billion. If you're just looking at claimant error or fraud then the gross overpayment is around £3.9 billion, while the net loss is also around £2.6 billion. Tax avoidance Finally, the post claims that tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year. This appears to refer to an unofficial estimate of the total \"tax gap\" calculated by Richard Murphy who runs the website Tax Research UK. HMRC says : \"The tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be paid to HMRC, and what is actually paid.\" Mr Murphy's £90 billion estimate does not just refer to tax avoidance, but all things that contribute to the tax gap, including things like errors. By contrast HMRC estimates that the tax gap is around £31 billion , of which around £4.6 billion is evasion , which is illegally omitting concealing or misrepresenting information to reduce tax, and £1.7 billion is avoidance , which is reducing your tax liability by acting within the letter but not the spirit of the law. We've written before about Mr Murphy's estimate before and why it varies so much from HMRC's official figure . The biggest component of the difference is how each calculates the value of the hidden economy or shadow economy . HMRC uses a \"bottom up\" approach, by surveying \"moonlighters\" (people who have a declared income but also an undeclared income on the side) and \"ghosts\" (people who do not declare any income to HMRC) to estimate the tax gap from the hidden economy. This comes to £2.6 billion. Mr Murphy instead applies a \" top down \" approach, applying the tax yield as a proportion of GDP (which he works out to be around 33%) to the estimated total value of the hidden economy to work out the tax gap. His figure comes to between £60 billion and £67 billion. Both figures have their limitations. Mr Murphy's calculation is somewhat simplistic in assuming that the 33% figure which represents tax as a proportion of GDP can be applied to the hidden economy. For example there will be parts of the hidden economy (such as the trade in illegal drugs) which by their very nature cannot be taxed and so there is no tax gap. Meanwhile, HMRC acknowledges that the coverage of its data isn't comprehensive and so the \"estimate should be interpreted broadly as a lower limit for the true scale of the tax gap relating to this group of taxpayers.\" More generally the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reviewed HMRC's analysis back in 2013. The National Audit Office (NAO) summarized the IMF's findings, saying it \"concluded that HMRC produced one of the most comprehensive studies of the tax gap available internationally. It concluded that in general the methodologies HMRC used to estimate the tax gap were sound\". However, the IMF \"also recommended that HMRC improve its estimates of undetected non-compliance\", according to the NAO. Ultimately, the NAO notes that \"The tax gap is inherently difficult to estimate and HMRC acknowledges that no estimate of the tax gap can be definitive and that its estimates carry a degree of uncertainty\".\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Gov. Scott Walker’s budget \"includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:We’ve heard a lot about how Wisconsin’s new state budget erases a $3 billion shortfall without raising taxes.But could it be true that the budget also provides billions of dollars in tax breaks?On June 24, 2011, two days before Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the budget into law, this declaration was made by liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now:\"Walker’s budget, includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.\"Versions of the $2 billion-plus claim have also been made in a joint news release from four left-leaning groups and on at least three occasions by Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha. The state Democratic Party put the $2 billion claim first on its list of \"worst items\" in Walker’s budget.So, let’s see what’s what.When asked about the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of One Wisconsin Now, pointed to a June 9, 2011, memo by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, long considered by both parties the neutral scorekeeper on budget matters. The memo was written at the request of Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona.The memo projects that various tax provisions adopted in 2011 will result in a reduction of $2.33 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. That appears to back the One Wisconsin Now claim.But the claim is a little more complicated than that -- it really has four elements:\"Walker’s budget (1) includes tax breaks for corporations (2) and the rich (3) that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade (4).\"1. \"Walker’s budget\"The group says the $2.3 billion in tax breaks over 10 years is part of the 2011-2013 budget that was proposed by Walker and modified and adopted by the Legislature. But the fiscal bureau reached its projection by considering tax breaks not only in the budget, but in five other business-related measures that were adopted by the Legislature early in 2011.Ross conceded his group made a \"misstatement.\" He noted that less than two weeks earlier, his group had issued a news release that attributed the $2.3 billion figure to both the budget and the earlier action.One cautionary note.Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, says it is difficult to project the effects of tax law changes over 10 years: \"It’s so volatile, I just don’t think you can forecast very far out.\"So, the first part of the claim is off because it cited only Walker’s budget -- but that’s relatively minor, since the budget built the earlier tax reductions into its assumptions.2. \"Tax breaks for corporations\"Ross pointed out that nearly $1.6 billion of the $2.3 billion tax breaks would go to corporations through three tax provisions.Tax cuts: On production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. The cuts would apply to small businesses as well as large corporations. The production tax cuts are by far the largest of the breaks, according to the fiscal bureau, resulting in a reduction of an estimated $874 million over 10 years.\"Combined reporting\": A partial rollback of a tax increase that was adopted two years ago on multi-state corporations. The fiscal bureau estimates the rollback would reduce tax revenue by $366 million over 10 years, making it the second-largest tax break. Tax deduction: For hiring new full-time employees. Ross argued that regardless of the size of a company, the money from the tax deduction \"is not going to average individual taxpayers.\" The new-hire deduction is the third-largest tax break, with an estimated loss in revenue of $335 million over 10 years.So, many of the tax breaks are geared toward corporations and business. That’s not surprising. The focus of the Walker-called special session of the Legislature in January was on improving the state’s business climate.3. Tax breaks for \"the rich\"Ross told us a \"a clear majority\" of the remaining $700 million in tax breaks will go to the \"rich.\"Of course, by saying \"clear majority,\" Ross is acknowledging not all of the remaining tax breaks are aimed at the rich. What’s more, there are many differing views of what constitutes the \"rich.\" The point behind the loaded language is they don’t help the average taxpayer.Ross highlighted three tax breaks:-- Health savings accounts: This legislation allows employees -- not employers -- to deduct contributions they make to their HSAs, which are used to pay medical expenses, from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes.Ross cited a May 2008 memo from the U.S. Government Accountability Office that says the average taxpayer who used an HSA in 2005 had an annual adjusted gross income of $139,000. He argues that that figure shows HSAs benefit \"the rich\" because the adjusted gross income of other tax filers was only $57,000.Berry doesn’t buy that argument. He said large corporations and the rich \"are more likely to have employer-paid health insurance and would not need an HSA.\" He noted that nearly every other state allows the deduction, which conforms with federal tax law.-- Two capital gains changes: One change eliminates state capital-gains taxes on long-term investments in Wisconsin businesses; the other would defer taxes on capital gains reaped anywhere if the proceeds are plowed back into a Wisconsin business. Together, they would result in an estimated tax revenue reduction of $436 million over 10 years.Ross cited a fiscal bureau report on the two measures that said \"capital gain income is concentrated among high-income taxpayers.\"Berry said eliminating the long-term investment capital gains tax would tend to benefit people with higher incomes. The deferral measure, however, merely delays taxes and isn’t a tax cut, he said.So, Part 3 of the claim is mixed. Ross himself acknowledged not all of the $700 million in question goes to the wealthy, only a \"clear majority.\" But the claim gets support from both the legislative fiscal bureau and the taxpayers alliance, who said the capital gains measures benefit higher-income taxpayers.4. Tax breaks \"cost\" Wisconsin taxpayersRoss argued that the tax breaks \"cost\" Wisconsin taxpayers \"because they are reducing the amount of revenue taken in by the state\" and because most taxpayers won’t benefit from them. He added: \"We remain steadfast in our belief that tax breaks are a form of spending.\"But we looked at that question in February 2011 when One Wisconsin Now claimed that $140 million in tax breaks backed by Walker amounted to \"new special interest spending.\" As we concluded then, cutting taxes is \"not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have.\" We gave the group a Pants on Fire on that claim.Let’s return to the current claim.One Wisconsin Now said the new state budget \"includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.\" The state fiscal bureau estimates tax breaks will bring in $2.3 billion less in revenue over 10 years. The group attributes it all to the budget, when much of it was in separate legislation.The group’s larger point -- that the tax breaks benefit corporations and wealthier residents, rather than average taxpayers -- is generally on target, given that the largest amounts of the tax breaks go to businesses and to individuals with higher incomes. But as we said in a past ruling, a tax break is not spending or a \"cost\" to taxpayers. It is money that stays with taxpayers.The statement contains accurate claims, primarily on who will benefit from newly adopted tax breaks, but shades the language (all in Walker’s budget, a \"cost\" to taxpayers) to amplify its political point.We rate the statement Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: On Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies. As part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration’s desire to be on good terms with the European Union. Approximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment. One conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform’s captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said. To investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation — whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason — we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden’s speech. Considering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage: “Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.” While saying “I’m eager to hear,” Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant “mmmm” in the word “I’m” blended with the next word, “eager,” to make a “mnnm-eager” sound. That was the source of the social media posts’ allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker’s reason for saying it. A more plausible reason for the president’s phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder. On several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in “repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound),” according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds. In other words, the claim is false — Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech. The February 2021 posts were not the first to twist Biden’s words to accuse him of using the racial slur. During a 1985 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing — when the president was a senator representing Delaware — Biden read out loud portions of a memo by Louisiana legislators that included the N-word, and supporters of former President Donald Trump attempted to frame that moment of Biden reciting other people’s words as an example of his alleged racism.

            "[Evidences]:The United States is expected to break records for voting by mail this year and that’s creating a deluge of claims on social media about deadlines. Some are accurate, some are not. \"15 days left to vote BUT if you are voting by mail, you need to vote TODAY,\" reads one popular Instagram post. \"USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day.\" reads. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is a screenshot of an Oct. 19 tweet by singer-songwriter Finneas Baird O'Connell, brother of singer Billie Eilish. Finneas’ Twitter profile photo is of the Biden/Harris campaign logo, but he has no official role with the campaign. The post wrongly creates the impression that there is a national deadline to vote by mail. It’s also a confusing message: the first sentence says voters must send it mail ballots 15 days ahead of time while the second sentence says the post office needs a 14-day roundtrip, suggesting that a voter can mail it in seven days ahead of time. Here’s what you should know: The Postal Service did recommend in a national postcard in September that voters request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day, Nov. 3, and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But this Instagram post omits the fact that states set their own laws about deadlines for receiving mail ballots. What’s more, many states have options for voters to bypass the mail to return their ballots in an official ballot drop box or drop off site. Since the deadlines to return mail ballots vary by state, the best advice for voters is to check in with their local elections officials for information about when they must return their ballot, and their options for how to return it. RELATED: Fact-checking the controversy over the USPS voting mailer Also, some states are automatically sending ballots to voters and therefore they don’t have to request them. A spokesperson for the post office reiterated their previous advice, but also encouraged voters to check their state’s requirements. An Instagram post states \"15 days left to vote BUT if you are voting by mail, you need to vote TODAY. USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day.\" The post is unclear and omits important context. USPS said in a postcard in September that voters who want to have their ballots counted in the Nov. 3 general election should request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But states set deadlines for receiving mail ballots, and many jurisdictions allow voters to bypass the mail and return ballots in official ballot drop boxes or drop off sites. It’s a good idea to return a ballot as soon as you can, but if you want to know the actual deadline for your state, check in with your state or local elections office. If you want to find out if your city or county has a place where you can drop it off, check in with your local elections office which typically posts that information on their website.

            "claim [Claim]: \"There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:A Brown University student leader offered a provocative historical comparison at the beginning of a Nov. 18, 2014, forum on the efficacy of taxing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island. \"There are more African-American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850,\" said Diego Arene-Morley, president of Brown University Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Arene-Morley made the statement to highlight that African-American and Hispanic men are arrested at disproportionate rates under the current drug laws. We wondered whether Arene-Morley got his numbers right, so we asked him what he based his statement on. We also reached out to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the national nonprofit advocacy group, The Sentencing Project, for current figures. And we contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data about slavery in 1850. The Census of 1850 showed that 872,924 male African-American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and \"free coloreds,\" was 23.2 million.) How does that compare with the number of African-American men now under some sort of judicial system supervision? According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 526,000 African-American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (That’s 37 percent of the overall 1.5 million imprisoned men.) That represented almost 3 percent of the overall black male population in the United States, compared with .5 percent of white males, according to the bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men on probation in 2013, according to the bureau. And there were 280,000 African-American male parolees. (Probation is part of a criminal sentence that allows an offender to remain under supervision in the community instead of jail. Parole is the supervised release of an inmate from jail before his or her official release date.) In total, there were about 1.68 million African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African-American men who were enslaved in 1850. Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, provided a somewhat higher estimate for the number of African-American men now imprisoned or on probation and parole. His number, which includes those serving time in local jails, was about 1.88 million, more than 1 million above the 1850 figure. For the Rhode Island perspective, we asked the state Department of Corrections for its numbers. As of Oct. 10, there were 932 African-American men sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male inmates overall. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 on parole; and 4 are on lifetime supervision, according to spokeswoman Susan Lamkins. That totals 5,308, or 11 percent of the 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island 18 years or older, according to the Census estimates as of July 1, 2013. When Arene-Morley got back to us, he referred us to the book \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness\" by Michelle Alexander and to an interview with Alexander featured on the Huffington Post website. The Huffington Post piece attributes to Alexander a statement the more black men are behind bars or under the watch of the criminal justice system than there were enslaved in 1850. Our ruling Arene-Morley said that \"There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.\" Our research found that U.S. Bureau of Criminal Statistics put the number of African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at about 1.68 million -- 807,076 above the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. The Sentencing Project, too, puts that number at 1.88 million with local jails factored in. Given that evidence, we rate Arene-Morley’s claim True.

            "[Evidences]:Stolen cars and the reckless driving that follows have climbed to the top of the worry list for Milwaukee residents who are now facing the first open mayoral race since 2004. A primary is scheduled for Feb. 15, with the spring election April 5. Acting Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who is among seven candidates, unveiled a plan in a Dec. 21, 2021 news release dubbed S.T.A.N.D. for Safer Streets. City officials say the plan focuses on: Safe street design Traffic enforcement Accountability Neighborhood Engagement Demand progress It includes physical road improvements; stepped-up police enforcement, a new policy for towing unregistered or unlicensed vehicle operators who are caught driving at dangerous speeds; and a staff member in the mayor’s office to coordinate the plan across city departments and work with residents and businesses. \"As a parent of three children in Milwaukee, and someone who drives these streets daily, I find the statistics around automobile accidents and vehicle thefts unacceptable,\" said Johnson. To be sure, at the time Johnson was the incoming mayor, since Mayor Tom Barrett – who had been confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg – had not yet resigned. Johnson was sworn in as acting mayor two days later. The news release went on to state that \"in 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars were stolen, double the amount in 2020.\" Let’s look at both parts of the claim. When asked for supporting data to back up Johnson’s statement, city staffers directed our attention to Milwaukee Police Department Traffic Safety Unit statistics. According to MPD data, the city saw 66 traffic fatalities in 2021 (as of Feb. 3, 2022, there had been 6). Johnson’s news release cited a figure of 65, so obviously one additional fatality occurred between that date and Dec. 31, 2021. But there is an important factor that gums up the claim: Johnson’s news release is citing reckless driving fatalities, while the MPD statistics simply cite traffic fatalities. Here is the department’s breakdown on traffic fatalities for 2021: 66 individuals were killed in fatal crashes There were 61 fatal crash incidents But only 38 of the 61 of the crashes involved reckless driving (62%) The 38 reckless vehicle crashes resulted in 43 fatalities. \"The fact that dozens of people died in such crashes verifies the seriousness of the problem,\" said Jeff Fleming, communications director for the mayor’s office, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"Nevertheless, we overstated last year’s reckless driving death toll.\" As a point of reference, Karen Domagalski, operations manager at the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, said there were 87 motor vehicle accident deaths in 2021 throughout the county, so deaths in accidents in the city accounted for nearly 76% percent of those. In Milwaukee, residents have increasingly raised concerns about reckless driving. Here is just a sampling of those incidents from 2021: June 16, 2021: A 16-year-old boy was killed and five other teens were hospitalized when police attempted to stop a stolen vehicle on the 9900 block of West Good Hope Road, but the driver instead led officers on a chase and eventually crossed over into oncoming traffic, hitting another vehicle head-on at 50 to 60 miles an hour. August 15, 2021: A car that was speeding and disregarding red traffic signals at 2:07 a.m. struck a Milwaukee County bus in the 2700 block of West Wisconsin Ave. The passenger of the car, a 38-year-old man, died from his injuries. The driver, a 28-year-old man, was hospitalized in stable condition after suffering life-threatening injuries. August 15, 2021: A Milwaukee man and woman were killed in a crash after two vehicles were drag racing at North 76th Street and West Silver Spring Drive around 7:10 p.m. and one vehicle struck a vehicle that had not been racing. Inside that other vehicle was a 66-year-old Milwaukee man and a 21-year-old Milwaukee woman. Both died on scene, police said. August 29, 2021: A 16-year-old boy was killed and three other teens, ranging in age from 15 to 17, were critically injured in a single-vehicle crash when the driver lost control and struck a tree about 3:30 p.m. in the 3100 block of North 20th Street, police said. Footage from TV news stations shows the damaged car ended up on the grounds of Union Cemetery. The second part of the claim is more straightforward. Johnson’s news release said more than 9,000 cars were stolen, double the amount in 2020. According to Milwaukee Police Department Crime Maps and Statistics, there were 4,508 thefts of motor vehicles in 2020, and the total by year’s end in 2021 was 10,482, an increase of 133%. So he is on the money there. Johnson claimed that \"In 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee have lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars have been stolen, double the amount in 2020.\" Johnson was correct with the stolen vehicle part of the claim, but was off on the deaths due to reckless driving. The number cited by Johnson was for all traffic fatalities. The actual figures, according to Milwaukee police, are 38 reckless vehicle crashes resulted in 43 fatalities.

            "claim [Claim]: In September 2021, Vincent Paterno, a FedEx Ground driver in Washington state, was fired for bragging online that he did not deliver packages to customers he perceived as politically left-leaning.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In September 2021, several news outlets and websites reported that FedEx had fired a Washington state driver who posted a video online in which he bragged that he had been refusing to deliver packages to customers he deemed to be politically left-leaning, or insufficiently patriotic. On Sept. 25, for example, Yahoo! News republished an article originally posted by TheGrio.com, which bore the headline “FedEx fires driver who refused to deliver to homes with flags representing BLM, Biden administration.” The article asserted that: A former FedEx driver who vowed in a profanity-laced video to never deliver packages to houses championing the Black Lives Matter movement, Joe Biden, or Kamala Harris has since been fired — and now won’t be delivering packages to any houses at all. First reported by TooFab on Friday, the delivery company terminated employee Vincent Paterno, 39, after catching wind of a TikTok video in which Paterno smugly states he will not extend services to any house with a flag representing BLM, the President or VP… That Sept. 24 article, by the website TooFab.com, contained a statement from FedEx which confirmed that Paterno no longer worked on behalf of the company: The company confirmed to TooFab will indeed not be delivering packages to those houses — or any other, in fact. “We are appalled by the behavior depicted in this video, which does not reflect the views of FedEx,” a spokesperson said. “This individual is no longer providing service on behalf of the company.” For understandable reasons, many observers interpreted this statement as meaning that Paterno had been fired, and several reports to that effect followed, including the aforementioned articles published by TooFab.com and TheGrio.com, but also HITC.com, KUBE 93.3, Black Enterprise, and The Shade Room. However, Paterno himself contradicted those claims in a subsequent TikTok video, insisting that he was not fired, but rather had arranged in advance for Sept. 16 — the date on which he posted the original anti-Biden video — to be his last day working on behalf of FedEx. Snopes asked FedEx to resolve this discrepancy, and to clarify whether Paterno had been fired — a perception created by FedEx’s own public statement — or had voluntarily left his job. Despite our repeated attempts to obtain clarification of those facts, FedEx repeatedly refused to offer any substantive response, and also failed to provide contact details for an independent contractor who operates the route on which Paterno worked. As such, we are issuing a rating of “Unproven.” If relevant evidence becomes available, or if FedEx provides the clarification requested, we will update this fact check accordingly. Before we go any further, an important piece of background information: Paterno was not, technically, an employee of FedEx. He worked for a “service provider” who operates a FedEx Ground route. FedEx Ground is a subsidiary of FedEx, and it contracts out package delivery to thousands of independent contractors around the country who, in turn, hire workers, including drivers such as Paterno. Paterno posted his original video to TikTok on Sept. 16. An edited transcript can read below: …I just wanted to come on here and let all of you know — if you don’t have a flag in front of your house, and if you have a Joe Biden, [Kamala Harris] [sign] posted up in front of your house, Black Lives Matter, I will not deliver your shit. I will not deliver your shit. I will bring that back to the station. And I will keep doing that shit… Around one week later, reports emerged online that FedEx had fired him, based solely on the statement provided by the company, which expressed strong disapproval of his remarks, and said “This individual is no longer providing service on behalf of the company.” Although FedEx did not explicitly state that Paterno had been fired, the ambiguity in their statement clearly created that impression, which was pervasive, as evidenced by the multiple online articles and news reports to that effect. On Sept. 26, Paterno posted a follow-up video, refuting reports that he had been fired, and insisting he had arranged in advance for Sept. 16 to be his last day working on behalf of FedEx. In support of that claim, he presented redacted screenshots of text messages which he claimed he had sent to his colleagues and supervisor, well in advance of Sept. 16. Snopes has not been able to verify the authenticity of those text messages; but if they are authentic, they strongly suggest Paterno had indeed arranged to stop working for FedEx in advance — with his final workday initially scheduled to be Sept. 3, but then pushed back to Sept. 16. This would in turn strongly suggest he had not been fired. Snopes asked FedEx to clarify whether Paterno had quit or been fired. A spokesperson for FedEx Ground refused to do so, claiming that the company does not “discuss details regarding the personnel of service providers” — that is, workers hired by the contractors who operate individual routes. However, this explanation was contradicted by the fact that FedEx had already commented publicly, not only describing Paterno’s behavior as “appalling,” but also confirming that he had once worked on behalf of FedEx Ground, and now no longer did. Indeed, if FedEx had actually stuck to its stated policy and declined to “discuss details” regarding Paterno’s employment status, in the first place, then there would have been no basis for the subsequent reports that he had been fired. We asked FedEx about this, making it clear that the widespread public perception that Paterno was fired stemmed entirely from the company’s own statement, and sending the company a copy of Paterno’s Sept. 26 video, which contained his strenuous denial that he was fired, as well as evidence that suggested he had instead left his job voluntarily. FedEx refused, again, to clarify whether Paterno had quit his job, or been fired. Snopes repeatedly asked FedEx for contact details for the independent contractor or “service provider” who operates Paterno’s former route, in order to gain clarification of the facts from them. FedEx did not acknowledge or respond to those requests.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Our federal government has lent $2 billion to the state-owned oil company of Brazil to allow them to explore for oil and gas.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:U.S. Senate candidate George Allen wants to drill here and now.The Republican has repeatedly reminded voters that the U.S. has the largest fossil fuel reserves in the world and faulted President Barack Obama for not aggressively developing them.Allen brought up the issue again in a Dec. 7 debate against Democrat Tim Kaine, who is also pursuing the U.S. Senate seat in 2012 that will be vacated by Jim Webb, D-Va. Allen voiced frustration with the Obama administration’s refusal to allow oil and natural gas leases off Virginia’s coast.\"Our federal government has lent $2 billion to the state-owned oil company of Brazil to allow them to explore for oil and gas, and that shows how contradictory our energy policies are,\" Allen said.Is the U.S. really financing $2 billion worth of off-shore energy production in Brazil?To back the claim, the Allen campaign emailed postings from several websites, including Forbes Magazine. Our research, however, shows that some of the information in the articles was loosely interpreted by Allen, and some of the information was inaccurate.All of the articles center on a tentative offer by the Export-Import Bank of the United States in April 2009 to provide up to $2 billion in financing to Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company.The Export-Import Bankis an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them purchase U.S. goods and services. The bank, as noted in a September storyby PolitiFact’s national staff, receives its spending authority from Congress but gets no appropriated funds. It operates using revenues from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers, although its transactions are ultimately backed by the U.S. government’s faith and credit. The bank is allowed to have up to $100 billion in outstanding loans.We called Ex-Im Bank’s spokesman, Phil Cogan, and asked him to assess Allen’s statement.\"It is not correct,\" he said.Ex-Im’s tentative agreement was an \"expression of the bank’s willingness\" to consider up to $2 billion in loan applications from Petrobras to finance its purchase of U.S. goods and supplies. All five of the bank’s board of directors who approved the decision were appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican.On Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan to Petrobras made by JPMorgan Chase. The loan guarantee is helping Petrobras purchase goods and services from about 150 U.S. companies, according to Cogan.There were no other financial transactions between Ex-Im and Petrobras before their preliminary loan agreement expired in April 2011. Cogan said it has not been renewed.So Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras, let alone the$2 billion Allen claimed. All it did was back a $308 million loan that a private bank made to the Brazilian oil company.Dan Allen, a senior adviser to the Allen campaign, told us George Allen should not be faulted for making a mistake about Ex-Im and Petrobras. He said George Allen based his statement on information published by credible news sources.\"We just didn’t come up with the stuff and throw it against the wall,\" Dan Allen said. \"We relied on something published on Forbes magazine’s website.\"He referred us to a May 2011 postingheadlined \"Petrobras to Tap Ex-Im Loan `Soon.’\" The Forbes article, however, appears to be referring to the closing of JPMorgan Chase’s loan to Petrobras that Ex-Im guaranteed.Dan Allen also sent us an articlethat ran this August in The Hill, a publication that covers Congress. That story, however, never said a $2 billion loan had been made. It merely noted that \"Republicans railed against a 2009 proposed $2 billion commitment from the U.S. Import-Export Bank to the Brazilian oil company Petrobras.\"Different claims about about the loan have been circulated over the last two years by conservative voices such asThe Wall Street Journal editorialpage, Fox NewsandGov. Rick Perry, R-Texas.Seeking to counter misinformation, Ex-Im has posted a website fact sheetabout its relationship with Petrobras. The bank takes exception to statements by Allen and others that the dealings reflect inconsistent federal policies on off-shore drilling.\"There is no connection between the federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales by other countries,\" the fact sheet says. \"In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors.\"Our conclusion:Allen says the U.S. government lent $2 billion to Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil.He is referring to a preliminary agreement by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an independent federal agency, to consider offering up to $2 billion in financing to help Petrobras buy American goods and services.In 2010, Ex-Im agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan made to Petrobras by JPMorgan Chase. There were no other transactions, and Ex-Im’s agreement with Petrobras expired this April.The bottom line is that that Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras. We rate Allen’s statement False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: In 1862, Abraham Lincoln ordered the execution by hanging of 38 Dakota Sioux fighters.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In March 2018, thousands of Facebook users shared a memewhich asserts that President Abraham Lincoln had ordered the executions of 38 Native American warriors in 1862: That claim is largely accurate, but it’s also misleading; it omits to mention that although Abraham Lincoln did approve 39 death sentences (one of the condemned men was ultimately spared), he also prevented the hangings of 264 other Native Americans by commuting their death sentences, in the same order. It also fails to make it clear that the death sentences did not originate with Lincoln. Rather, the executions were ordered by a military commission and sent to the president, who had the legal authority to approve or decline to approve any or all of the sentences. The Dakota War of 1862 involved a violent uprising by Dakota Sioux tribal members in Minnesota in response to hunger and privation as well as treaty violations on the part of the United States federal government, which had a long history of displacing and exploiting Native American peoples since the birth of the American colonies. The conflict began in August 1862, lasted for six weeks, and involved killings, atrocities, and hostage-takings on both sides.On 26 September 1862, the Dakota surrendered at what became known as Camp Release in Minnesota. According to the Minnesota Historical Society, the U.S. forces then commenced military trials for hundreds of captured Dakota fighters: On September 28, 1862, two days after the surrender at Camp Release, a commission of military officers established by Henry Sibley began trying Dakota men accused of participating in the war… As weeks passed, cases were handled with increasing speed. On November 5, the commission completed its work. 392 prisoners were tried, 303 were sentenced to death, and 16 were given prison terms. On 9 November 1862, the list of the 303 condemned Dakota fighters was sent to Lincoln for his approval of their executions. Two days later, he requested a review of their cases and trials. In July 1862, the United States Congress had passed a law relating to court martials and military commissions which made it clear that death sentences emerging from such trials could not be carried out without the approval of the President of the United States: …Be it further enacted that the President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a judge advocate general, with the rank, pay, and emoluments of a colonel of cavalry, to whose office shall be returned, for revision, the records and proceedings of all courts-martial and military commissions, and where a record shall be kept of all proceedings had thereupon. And no sentence of death, or imprisonment in the penitentiary, shall be carried into execution until the same shall have been approved by the President. In a major 1990 paper on the trials and executions, University of Minnesota law professor Carol Chomsky was highly critical of the trials and of Lincoln’s confirmation of the execution of the Dakota fighters for actions taken in the context of a military conflict, a punishment that was not handed down to other military combatants, such as Confederate soldiers in the Civil War. However, she also noted that Lincoln was under intense pressure to sign off on the executions of all 303 Dakota men, and that a mob in Minnesota, stoked by local political leaders, threatened to implement vigilante justice should the president spare any of the condemned fighters: [Major General John Pope] warned [Lincoln] that the people of Minnesota, perhaps combined with some of the soldiers, would take matters into their own hands and kill “all the Indians — old men, women, and children,” if the President did not allow all the executions to go forward. If the President proved reluctant to decide, he suggested, the condemned could be turned over to the state government. Minnesota Governor Ramsey left no doubt what decision he would make if given the opportunity, writing to Lincoln to urge execution of all the condemned. A great public outcry arose in Minnesota in response to reports that Lincoln might not carry out the full sentence of the military commission. The Stillwater, Minnesota Messenger demanded extermination of the Dakota: “DEATH TO THE BARBARIANS! is the sentiment of our people.”‘ Minnesota’s Senator Morton Wilkinson and Representatives Cyrus Aldrich and William Windom wrote to Lincoln reciting stories of rapes and mutilation “well known to our people” and protesting any decision to pardon or reprieve the Dakota. If the President did not permit the executions, they said, “the outraged people of Minnesota would dispose of these wretches without law. These two peoples cannot live together. We do not wish to see mob law inaugurated in Minnesota, as it certainly will be, if you force thepeople to it.” In December 1862, Lincoln announced his decision about the issue to the United States Senate, suggesting that the priority of executions should be directed at captives who had committed acts of rape: Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I ordered a careful examination of the records of the trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females. However, the president discovered that only two of the 303 men had been convicted of rape, and so he widened the criteria for execution to those who had committed “massacres” (as opposed to just taking part in “battles”): This class numbered forty, and included the two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly recommended by the commission which tried them for commutation to ten years’ imprisonment. I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on Friday, the 19th … In the end, one of the 39 condemned men had his death sentence commuted, and the executions of the remaining 38 Dakota fighters took place on 26 December 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota: A few weeks later, the New York Times offered a harrowing and disturbingaccount of those executions: Precisely at the time announced — 10 A.M. — a company, without arms, entered the prisoners’ quarters to escort them to their doom. Instead of any shrinking or resistance, all were ready, and even seemed eager to meet their fate. Rudely they jostled against each other, as they rushed from the doorway, ran the gauntlet of the troops, and clambered up the steps to the treacherous drop. As they came up and reached the platform, they filed right and left, and each one took his position as though they had rehearsed the programme. Standing round the platform, they formed a square, and each one was directly under the fatal noose. Their caps were now drawn over their eyes, and the halter placed about their necks. Several of them feeling uncomfortable, made severe efforts to loosen the rope, and some, after the most dreadful contortions, partially succeeded. The signal to cut the rope was three taps of the drum. All things being ready, the first tap was given, when the poor wretches made such frantic efforts to grasp each other’s hands, that it was agony to behold them. Each one shouted out his name, that his comrades might know he was there. The second tap resounded on the air. The vast multitude were breathless with the awful surroundings of this solemn occasion. Again the doleful tap breaks on the stillness of the scene. Click! goes the sharp ax, and the descending platform leaves the bodies of thirty-eight human beings dangling in the air. The greater part died instantly; some few struggled violently, and one of the ropes broke, and sent its burden with a heavy, dull crash, to the platform beneath. A new rope was procured, and the body again swung up to its place. It was an awful sight to behold. Thirty-eight human beings suspended in the air, on the bank of the beautiful Minnesota; above, the smiling, clear, blue sky; beneath and around, the silent thousands, hushed to a deathly silence by the chilling scene before them, while the bayonets bristling in the sunlight added to the importance of the occasion. It is accurate to say that Lincoln approved the executions of 39 Dakota fighters, and that despite their convictions for participating in war-time massacres, the condemned men were not afforded the conventional rights of due process (such as trial by jury) and did not have attorneys present to plead on their behalf. It is also true that Lincoln, as President of the United States, did have the legal authority to commute all 303 death sentences presented to him for his approval. However, in the very act of approving 39 executions, Lincoln was at the same time ordering the commutation of 264 death sentences. Despite intense political and popular pressure, Lincoln spared the lives of many more Dakota fighters than he condemned, albeit not as many as he could have. The popular meme displayed above leaves out this very important context, and it therefore gives an incomplete and misleading account of Lincoln’s December 1862 decision.\n",

They have no shame!\" The tweet contains one image of what appears to be a man dressed in a burqa (left) and a second image of a woman being pulled by her hijab (right): On October 2, 2022, authorities dispersed scores of women in Afghanistan's western city of Herat who were protesting against a suicide attack two days earlier that had killed dozens in the capital Kabul. The attack targeted the women’s section of a gender-segregated study hall in a neighbourhood that is home to the historically oppressed Shiite Muslim Hazara community, AFP reported. Other posts claiming the image of the burqa-clad man shows a protester in Herat were published on Twitter here, here, here and here, with nearly 100 shares between them. However, the image has been shared in a misleading context. A reverse image search on Google found the photo was previously published in this report by Pakistan's Geo News on June 2, 2021. \"Lahore police arrest burqa-clad man from court,\" the report's title reads. According to the report, police caught the man despite his attempts to evade arrest after his in-laws accused him of kidnapping their daughter. Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (left) with the original from Geo News (right): The incident was also reported by Pakistan's ARY News and G News Network (GNN), with additional photos showing the accused standing alongside police officers in Lahore. \"According to a Lahore police spokesman, a young man named Faraz had got married in Misri Shah, and the girl's parents had registered a kidnapping case against the accused,\" reads GNN's report. \"The accused said that he used the burqa to avoid arrest and opponents and seek interim bail in the case,\" the report continues. Scenes showing the woman in the image on the right-hand side of the posts, who is being pulled by her hijab, can be viewed in a video report on the protests by the BBC's Dari language service on Twitter here.

            "[Evidences]:“People under 50 who fundamentally have no health risks, there’s no scientific rationale for them to ever become vaccinated,” Dr Peter McCullough says in testimony to the Senate of the US state of Texas around the 13-minute mark of this video. The video of the March 10, 2021 testimony was shared on Facebook by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, an organization described on its website as “fighting the good fight to preserve the practice of private medicine since 1943.” Its YouTube post of the video has been viewed more than 200,000 times. The video was also shared via various websites, and shorter clips of the testimony circulated with French subtitles. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Health Canada and the World Health Organization all recommend vaccination against Covid-19. As of April 9, 2021, more than 560,000 people in the United States and 23,000 people in Canada have died from Covid-19. Multiple Covid-19 vaccines are being administered or are in trials around the world, and inaccurate claims about the shots are spreading across the internet. More than 174 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the United States, and 7.4 million have been administered in Canada. Below, AFP Fact Check examines three false claims made by McCullough. The CDC says on its website that risk of severe disease from the novel coronavirus increases with age, but National Center for Health Statistics data shows that people under age 50 account for four percent of deaths involving Covid-19. And a March 26, 2021 article in Science also found that by mid-August 2020 “the resurgence in the United States was largely driven by adults 20 to 49 years of age.” Olivier Schwartz, head of the Virus and Immunity Unit at the Pasteur Institute, told AFP by phone: “It is obvious that people under 50 who are in good health should be vaccinated” because they can still be affected by the disease. Bruno Lina, professor of virology at the University of Lyon, said that the aim of a mass vaccination campaign is to reduce the transmission of a virus. This would not be effective if only people over 50 years old received the vaccine. That is less than half the population, and “under these conditions, we will never slow down the circulation of the virus,” he said. Both Schwartz and Lina said that while the Covid-19 vaccines currently authorized cannot guarantee that a person will not catch the disease, they have been shown to lessen symptoms and prevent death. Lina also explained that if a vaccinated person does contract Covid-19, the amount of virus present compared to an unvaccinated person is “16 times less,” reducing the likelihood of transmission. AFP Fact Check has debunked other claims that vaccination against Covid-19 is unnecessary or should be halted from medical professionals from Texas, Canada and Belgium. Around the 12-minute mark of his testimony, McCullough claims: “People who develop Covid have complete and durable immunity.” He goes on to say, “You can’t beat natural immunity. You can’t vaccinate on top of it and make it better. There’s no scientific, clinical or safety rationale for ever vaccinating a Covid recovered patient.” However, an article in the journal BMJ found reinfection is possible. Lina said that “we have the feeling today that the vaccine induces better immunity than certain natural infections.” He said that for people with less symptomatic bouts of Covid-19, “we observe a rapid loss of antibody titer, and therefore a potential for reinfection faster than that observed with vaccination.” The Pasteur Institute’s Schwartz also confirmed that people who have contracted Covid-19 have an interest in being vaccinated “because the antibody level decreases in all people.” He said boosting antibody levels, even in those vaccinated, will be particularly important against variants “which need more antibodies to be neutralized.” There are also indications that some people suffering from lingering symptoms of Covid-19, or “long Covid,” have experienced relief after vaccination. McCullough testified: “One of the mistakes I heard today as a rationale for vaccinations is asymptomatic spread and I want you to be very clear about this -- my opinion is there is a low degree, if any, of asymptomatic spread. “Sick person gives it to sick person. The Chinese have published a study in the British Medical Journal, 11 million people, they’re trying to find asymptomatic spread. You can’t find it,” he said. AFP examined other misleading claims about this Chinese research in an article in January. The study, published in the scientific journal Nature, was conducted in the latter half of May 2020 after Wuhan relaxed a strict lockdown that had been in place for months. Fujian Song, one of the report’s authors, said in an email on January 6, 2021 that, “It is misleading/incorrect/wrong to conclude that ‘all asymptomatic’ individuals infected with Covid-19 are not infectious, based on the results of the paper.” The BMJ published a report on the research on December 1, 2020. Citing the study’s authors, it said that “the findings cannot be extrapolated to countries where outbreaks have not been brought under control successfully.” University of Lyon’s Lina confirmed that it is incorrect to claim that asymptomatic people can’t spread the virus.

            "[Evidences]:Social media users are claiming the leaders of more than a dozen countries are telling farmers to call it quits in order to address climate change. In a July 27 Instagram reel, a person says, \"In case you missed it, 13 nations agree to abolish farming in order to save the planet.\" The person points to a European Union Times headline that makes the same claim. This Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The European Union Times describes itself as an \"international newspaper\" whose ideology is \"Christian and Conservative.\" Its article about certain countries abolishing farming was copied from the Liberty Sentinel, another conservative website. Both the European Union Times and the Liberty Sentinel reference a May 17 press release from the Global Methane Hub, a Santiago, Chile-based philanthropic organization focused on lowering global methane emissions. But the Global Methane Hub press release makes no mention of countries abolishing farming to reduce methane emissions. According to the release, following the first Ministerial Conference on Low Emissions Food Systems in Santiago in April, agricultural and environmental leaders of 13 major livestock-producing countries, such as John Kerry, U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, committed to improving climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as to lowering methane emissions in agriculture and food systems. Methane is a greenhouse gas primarily emitted by human activities that, along with carbon dioxide, is a major driver of climate change. The countries signing the pledge were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Germany, Panama, Peru, Spain, the United States and Uruguay. The press release does not say what specific changes these countries will make to reduce methane emissions. However, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, one of the conference’s collaborators, has proposed solutions for the agricultural sector in its 2021 Global Methane Assessment. The coalition is a voluntary partnership of more than 160 governments, intergovernmental groups and nongovernmental organizations. Solutions include improving animal health and husbandry, water management of rice paddies, sustainable eating practices and food chain management. Nearly all human-caused methane emissions come from three sectors: agriculture, fossil fuels and waste, according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. The global agricultural sector, which includes livestock rearing, animal manure and rice production, is the largest contributor of human-derived methane emissions at 40%. Fossil fuels account for 35% and waste from food and organic materials makes up 20%. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition’s Global Methane Assessment found that agricultural methane emissions can be reduced by up to 25% by 2030 through low-cost solutions that use existing technologies. \"But solutions are not yet being applied at sufficient scale,\" the report says. The Global Methane Assessment does not advocate for abolishing farming as a way to reduce methane emissions. We rate the claim that 13 countries have agreed \"to abolish farming in order to save the planet\" False.\n",

No, that's not true: clearer footage shows the man is just a fireman. The video clip started circulating on social media during the fire on April 15, 2019 and it looks like it was filmed by someone pointing a cellphone at a television screen and zooming in: An example of the video can be seen in this tweet published on April 16, 2019 (archived here) which read: \"@realDonaldTrump ????BREAKING: No workers present at the time that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire started......So who is this guy dressed in Muslim garb?? #The200 https://t.co/cHYlJCcsQr\" 🚨BREAKING: No workers present at the time that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire started......So who is this guy dressed in Muslim garb??#The200 pic.twitter.com/cHYlJCcsQr -- ❌🚨The Real Cornett🚨❌ (@therealcornett) April 16, 2019 French fact checkers looked into the issue: Notre-Dame : qui est cette personne en gilet jaune sur une tour qui affole les réseaux sociaux étrangers ?

The same live stream was also carried by CNBC and at 42:05 you can clearly see the man in question walk by: Because this is a direct video feed and not a cellphone video of a television screen the colors and details are much clearer. The man is wearing a yellow high visibility vest and a shiny helmet, not a \"muslim garb\". At the start of the video the fire is already quite big and at the moment the man walks by one can also see jets of water being sprayed against the side of the tower by the fire brigade. This would seem to indicate the fire brigade was on the scene already at the time the footage was shot. At the 30:30 mark in the video several other firemen can be seen standing in the same place: And at the 42:50 mark, barely 45 seconds after the \"mystery man\" walked by, more firemen can be seen coming out of the door he went into, seemingly inspecting or pulling a firehose or a cable: So yeah, it was just a fireman.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A post is being shared on Facebook by many users claiming that Emanuel Eminiki, a Nigerian football player, divorced one Miss Nigeria to marry another Miss Nigeria. Even Indian cricketer, Virender Sehwag has shared a similar post on his Twitter account. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here. Claim: Emanuel Eminiki divorced Miss Nigeria 2017 and married Miss Nigeria 2018 Fact: Emanuel Eminiki has married Iheoma Nnadi in 2018. She was the winner of the Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria contest in 2014, not Miss Nigeria. Eminiki has never married before this wedding. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When searched for the wedding of Emanuel Eminiki on Google, it was found that similar posts were shared on various platforms with different years. According to the Pulse article, Eminiki was never married before his wedding with Iheoma Nnadi. They got married last year in May but before that, they had a daughter in 2017. Also, Iheoma Nnadi was not Miss Nigeria 2017 or 2018 but she was the winner of the ‘Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria’ contest in 2014. This all started with the post of Reekado Banks, a Nigerian Singer, which was deleted later after a serious reply from Eminiki to remove the post. In fact, both the pictures in the post are from the pre-wedding shoot of Emanuel Eminiki and Iheoma Nnadi. They are available on the official account of the Photographer’s Facebook page. These pictures were also reported by multiple african news outlets here and here. Finally, Emanuel Eminiki has neither married Miss Nigeria 2017 nor married Miss Nigeria 2018.\n",

            "[Evidences]:In September 2016, the FDA ruled that a host of products could no longer be sold due to their containing triclosan, an antimicrobial agent. Despite containing triclosan, the toothpaste was conspicuously not included in the list of banned products, and continues to be approved by the FDA; the agency made no announcement regarding triclosan or Colgate Total in June 2017. On 26 June 2017,Woman Daily Tipspublished an article appearing to report that the Food and Drug Administration had just announced it would be banning the antimicrobial agent triclosan, which is commonly found in soaps and toothpaste: The FDA has just issued a warning this week noting that they will be putting a ban on triclosan — a common antibacterial agent used in soaps, detergents, toys, cosmetics, and toothpaste. Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects. Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient. In reality, Colgate Total is one of very few products containing triclosan that the FDA hasnot banned. In September 2016, the agency ruled that a host of antiseptic and antibacterial wash products could no longer be sold in the United States, due to the presence of certain ingredients — including triclosan: The agency issued aproposed rule in 2013after some data suggested that long-term exposure to certain active ingredients used in antibacterial products — for example, triclosan (liquid soaps) and triclocarban (bar soaps) — could pose health risks, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects. However, this ruling did not include Colgate Total because the manufacturers — Colgate-Palmolive —were able to demonstrate that the health benefits of the product (it is effectiveat reducing plaque and gingivitis) outweighed any potential for harm. At the time, FDA spokesperson Andrea Fischer told the New York Times: Based on scientific evidence, the balance of benefit and risk is favorable for these products. The FDA’s official stance on Colgate Total has not changed since September 2016, and the product was included in the June 2017 approved drug product list. The American Dental Association also lists Colgate Total as an “accepted product“. The irony of the Woman Daily Tips article is that it singles out a specific brand of toothpaste as being the subject of an imminent ban due to its containing triclosan, when in fact Colgate Total is conspicuous as a product that was not banned in a September 2016 ruling on triclosan. Contrary to the article’s claim, the FDA did not make an announcement during the week of 26 June 2017 that a ban on Colgate Total, or an additional ban on triclosan, was imminent; nor did the agency make such an announcement at any time during the first half of 2017.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Ron Johnson described believers in man-made causes of climate change as \"crazy\" when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2010, saying that sunspot activity or \"just something in the geologic eons of time\" were more likely explanations for extreme weather. Now in his third year in the Senate, Johnson is markedly more diplomatic when responding to constituents who want him to support limits on greenhouse gas emissions. \"Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding cap-and-trade policies and climate change,\" he wrote to Greg Everett, a retired musician from Conover on March 26, 2013. \"I share your desire to protect our natural environment.\" Still, Johnson sought to make clear to Everett -- who had signed a petition asking Johnson to support cap and trade -- his continued opposition to government intervention in this realm. \"But I am equally concerned that misguided efforts to improve the environment can destroy much-needed jobs and new job creation,\" Johnson said in a response that Everett posted on his blog. \"Too often, these policies become so prohibitively expensive that they undermine economic growth and the average American's ability to support himself or herself.\" Johnson then referred to \"a recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy.\" The study, he wrote, \"showed it would cost Wisconsin nearly 75,000 jobs by 2030 and result in a loss of disposable income of up to $6,900 per household. It could also raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent.\" We’re aware there’s general agreement that cap-and-trade legislation carries a cost for most -- if not all -- consumers. But the numbers Johnson cites on gas and electric costs are eye-popping. Let’s take a look. How cap and trade works Generally speaking, cap and trade works like this: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies that find ways to reduce pollution easily and cheaply can end up with extra credits, and sell them to other companies that have trouble reducing their emissions or want to make longer-term investments in conservation, according to a summary by the Environmental Defense Fund. While companies may exchange allowances, the overall limit on pollution remains in place. The cap would then be reduced over time to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions. A lower cap aims to make it more costly for utilities and industries to continue burning fossil fuels. When we asked Johnson for backup, a spokesman in his office said the constituent response refers to a 2008 study commissioned by groups concerned about a cap-and-trade bill introduced in the Senate. The study does have numbers very close to what Johnson cited -- 141 and 177 percent increases, for gas and oil, solely because of the bill. The study broke out price effects for each state, as well as a national figure. But several things jumped out at us about the study. In predicting price effects over nearly 25 years, the study presents a range of low and high price-hike estimates, not single figures. The low-cost estimate for gasoline is 72 percent, half of the worst-case estimate. For electricity, the low end increase was 126 percent. Johnson mentions only the worst-case scenario, though he did frame it as prices \"could\" jump by the higher figures. The study was commissioned by two groups that have opposed legislative efforts on climate change on the same economic grounds that Johnson cites. They are the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). It is relatively recent, 2008, but it focused on a bill -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) -- first introduced in 2007. It was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate. Neither got as much traction as a 2009 bill that passed the House. When we broadened our search, we found numerous impact studies by public and private entities on cap-and-trade legislation, and specifically on Lieberman-Warner. According to experts, all such efforts at forecasting energy price increases are iffy due to the complexity level. The cost projections on Lieberman-Warner are \"at best speculative\" and should be viewed skeptically, warned an exhaustive Congressional Research Service review of six studies. \"It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled.\" Fuel price estimates, in particular, vary widely depending on various assumptions made by researchers, the review said. And the study for the manufacturing group -- cited by Johnson -- showed dramatically higher increases in gasoline prices than predicted in studies by two government agencies and a non-profit that supports cap and trade, the research service found. Gasoline: The Johnson-cited study projected hikes of $1.70 to $3.25 per gallon by 2030, while the federal government’s official source of energy statistics, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted increases of 40 cents per gallon. The non-profit Clean Air Task Force put the hike at 25 cents. The figures compared are national, not specific to Wisconsin. Electricity: The Johnson-cited study predicted increases at least twice as high as studies by EIA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Task Force, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Mining Association. Again, the figures are national. The CRS specifically warned about breaking down cost impacts state by state -- as the manufacturers study did -- saying: \"Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism.\" Overall, the service found, \"the more comprehensive analyses are the work by EPA, EIA, and MIT.\" Another bill, another study The two groups behind the study Johnson relied on also did a separate projection of the Wisconsin energy cost impact of a more recent bill -- the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 sponsored by U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey. The Waxman-Markey bill, unlike Lieberman-Warner, passed the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009. It did not get a Senate vote. Its impact was studied in 2009. In that study, the two groups projected much smaller price increases from Waxman-Markey (19.9 percent to 26.1 percent for gas, and 37.5 percent to 59.7 percent for electric)than from the bill Johnson chose to highlight (increases well over 100 percent). That’s likely because Waxman-Markey rolled some of the revenue from pollution permits back to consumers in the form of rebates or expanded efficiency programs. Johnson spokesman Brian Faughnan told us Johnson’s climate change letter was simply an attempt to show the reasonable possible impact of major legislation that started in the Senate, the chamber where he serves. \"Senator Johnson’s letter does not claim to give a full range of the estimates of the impact of cap and trade,\" Faughnan wrote in an email to us. And in any event, the two studies by the manufacturers show major increases in gas prices, and significantly greater electricity costs, Faughnan wrote. Our rating Experts agree that cap and trade likely means higher energy costs for consumers. Johnson goes further, saying it would be \"prohibitively expensive.\" He tells constituents he opposes it in part because a \"recent study\" showed it could \"raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent.\" There is a study that includes those estimates for Wisconsin. But Johnson ignores critical facts. The same study cites much smaller increases under a second scenario. And its conclusions, published by opponents of the bill, are an outlier among several other studies that independent congressional researchers say were more thorough -- and show much smaller increases. He also ignores studies that said a more recent bill dramatically held down the size of cost increases to consumers. In an area in which precise conclusions are difficult, Johnson cherry-picks one study of a dead bill and presents its worst-case scenario as hard evidence of \"prohibitively expensive\" effects of a cap and trade approach. We rate his statement Mostly False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:After a Senate deal brought the 16-day government shutdown to a close, President Barack Obama wanted to make sure the impact of narrowly avoiding a default wasn’t lost on the nation. \"These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy,\" he said in a public address Thursday. As proof, he offered up specific claims including, \"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months.\" PolitiFact wanted to know whether Obama’s CEO statistic was accurate. The White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey. \"Fifty percent of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months,\" the report reads. On its face, that’s in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired their results. They would not disclose their exact question wording to us. Their report notes, \"Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total Business Roundtable membership.\" Business Roundtable’s membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it’s safe to say the poll responses don’t reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses. Since Obama often speaks to the Business Roundtable, we wanted to see what his relationship with the group was like. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, who specializes in lobbying, said there’s not much of a connection. \"Many of them have long-term relationships with government (simply because of their size and the government’s size), but probably only a handful have any kind of even semi-close relationship with Obama,\" he said. We ran the poll results by another business group, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Senior policy analyst Holly Wade said she saw a similar sentiment among the smaller business owners that the federation represents. \"In September, there were more small business owners that were feeling pessimistic about business conditions six months out,\" she said. There wasn’t much opinion voiced about delaying employment specifically, though. But Wade said that could be because small businesses were already hiring less during the economic recovery compared to bigger corporations. Why would CEOs want to delay hiring? With another possible debt ceiling default looming Feb. 7, University of Maryland finance professor David Kass said it’s likely that a budget deal will lead to tighter fiscal policy, which would slow down the economy and cause CEOs to put off hiring decisions for a few months. Another factor that would contribute to CEO anxiety is consumer behavior. While day-to-day spending probably won’t change post-shutdown, consumers will likely postpone higher ticket purchases, like homes and cars. \"On the demand side, there’s uncertainty on the consumers’ part, which in turn will have an impact on CEOs,\" Kass said. \"They’re trying to predict their future sales and what the environment will look like. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone.\" In any case, Obama is trying to communicate that the shutdown had a significant financial impact on the nation, and he’s not wrong there. Independent forecasts agree that the shutdown was a setback for the U.S. economy, though they differ on exact figures. Our ruling Obama said 50 percent of CEOs are delaying hiring due to the shutdown, which accurately cites the results of a poll sponsored by the Business Roundtable. The survey’s limited sampling, though, means the responses aren’t necessarily representative of all U.S. businesses. But the idea that the shutdown affects how businesses think about hiring is more broadly applicable. Experts said it’s reasonable that CEOs would be hesitant to hire, given that uncertainty about government fiscal policy can affect consumer confidence. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True\n",

She was elected to Congress in the November 2020 general election after running unopposed. In February 2021 she was stripped of her committee assignments in Congress over her incendiary rhetoric and support for conspiracy theories. Greene responded to the situation by tweeting that it was the result of a conspiracy against her by Twitter and House Democrats, a claim she offered without evidence: Her tweet was directed at Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey: I was just told @Twitter suspended me for 12 hrs in ‘error,’ on the same day Dems introduced a resolution to expel me from Congress. What a coincidence? Twitter’s little error wasn’t resolved until after 12 hrs. @jackwhich employee made the “error?” Reply to my email, Jack Greene was referring to a resolution introduced by U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., on the same day of the Twitter kerfuffle. The resolution seeks to expel Greene from the House and accuses Greene of rhetoric supporting violence against her Democratic peers in Congress. Expelling a member of Congress would require support from two-thirds of the House, making the resolution’s failure likely, however. Greene was temporarily suspended by Twitter in January 2021 for violating the platform’s terms on election integrity. Greene had promoted false claims of mass-scale voter fraud. Such claims by her and others incited a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by supporters of former U.S, President Donald Trump.

            "[Evidences]:The South African government has its eye on sweet-toothed citizens. Finance minister Pravin Gordhan announced a proposed tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in his February 2016 budget speech. The comment period closed last week and the tax is planned to be in effect from 1 April 2017 . The tax has been described as \"murderous\" by the chairman of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, Phil Gutsche. The Beverages Association of South Africa , a membership-based industry body representing the interests of non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers, claims that the tax is unnecessary and will have far reaching implications. We fact-checked two of their claims contained in the comment document they submitted to Treasury . What is the sugar tax? Sugar-sweetened drinks include soft drinks, sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, vitamin water drinks, sweetened iced teas and lemonades . These drinks have sugar added to them during processing and preparation. Government has proposed that these drinks be taxed at a rate of 2.29 cents per gram of sugar. This means that drinks with large amounts of added sugar will be more taxed more. A 330 ml can of Fanta Grape contains nearly 10.5 teaspoons of sugar and would be taxed an additional R1. A can of Coca-Cola (just more than 8 teaspoons of sugar ) would be taxed R0.80. Drinks which contain natural sugars - like unsweetened milk and 100% fruit juice - would not be taxed. Sugar-sweetened drinks of which the sugar content is not disclosed on the packaging would be taxed at a fixed sugar level of 50 grams per 330 ml. The World Health Organisation recommends that \"free sugar\" should make up less than 10% (about 12 teaspoons per day) of adults and children's total energy intake. This includes sugar added to food and drinks and sugar naturally present  in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Reducing your intake to below 5% would provide additional health benefits, the organisation says. Claim \"[Sugar-sweetened drinks] account for just 3% of daily calorie intake in South Africa.\" Verdict misleading \"A combination of sources\" were used to calculate the figure, according to consultant Karishma Jivan of FTI Consulting, the media consultant for the Beverages Association. \"We used the analysis conducted by Manyema Hofman et al … which indicates that average consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is 184 ml per day,\" Jivan told Africa Check. She said this figure was found to be consistent with internal and industry sugar-sweetened drinks sales figures, which are not in the public domain. The study Jivan referred to, published in 2014, used data from the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that was co n d u c t e d b y South Africa's Human Sciences Research Council and the Medical Research Council . One litre of sugar-sweetened drinks was assumed to contain 430 calories. A daily intake of 184 ml would account for approximately 79 calories. This works out to 3.2% of an adult South African man's recommended diet and 3.9% of an adult South African woman's recommended diet . However, this average percentage does not provide insight into the range of consumption, according to Dr Zandile Mchiza from the Human Social Research Council's Population Health, Health System and Innovation programme \"Sugar-sweetened drink calories are not evenly distributed to the population. Some people consume more energy from sugar added drinks than the others, while others do not consume at all,\" Mchiza explained. \"Hence we find some people gaining weight or presenting with ill health due to non-communicable diseases more than the others.\" What about children? This percentage is not representative of the \"average South African\", as claimed by the Beverages Association. People surveyed for the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were 15 years and older. The study did not include any data on how much sugar-sweetened drinks children under the age of 15 consume. Jivan conceded that the study's findings only referred to adult South Africans. \"Whether [sugar-sweetened drinks] account for 3% or more or less of a child's daily intake is something we don't have data on,\" she said. There is currently no representative data on how much sugar-sweetened drink children consume. \"It's a challenge because we only have localised studies,\" says Mchiza, \"we need a full, national food consumption study to give us an idea of what is happening.\" Estimate could be conservative Sugar-sweetened drinks consumption varies between age groups, according to the study. However, the study the Beverages Association based their claim on notes that the estimate may be on the low side. \"184 ml is a conservative estimate, and is based on self-reported consumption,\" Aviva Tugendhaft, an author of the study and the deputy director of PRICELESS SA , a unit of the Wits School of Public Health that aims to \"enable smart decisions about health investments\", told Africa Check. \"Self-reported data is subject to recall bias, which often sees consumption under-reported.\" The authors also highlight industry data that suggests the intake of sugar-sweetened drinks could be higher. The Coca-Cola company estimated that South Africans on average consumed 160 ml of their beverages per day in 2011 . This estimate - which is almost as high as the study's total sugar-sweetened drink consumption estimate - excludes the intake of sugar-sweetened drinks produced by other beverage manufacturers, such as Energade, Pepsi, Ceres, Liqui Fruit, Lipton Ice Tea, Coo-ee and Red Bull. Claim \" This decline in [sales] volumes could result in 62,000-72,000 job losses, many of which will be in small-scale farms and spazas. \" Verdict unproven This claim was made in the Beverages Association 's submission to treasury , where it links the decrease in sales to job losses. But how did they reach this figure? The Beverages Association told us it is based on a 2016 study by Oxford Economics , paid for by the association. Oxford Economics is an international consulting company that analyses market trends for businesses. The association did not provide us with the study itself or the data it was based on, however. 'Job figures patently exaggerated' A man sells soft drinks in bulk at a shop in Zandspruit township in greater Johannesburg in March 2016. Photo: AFP/MUJAHID SAFODIEN\" /> \"These figures [of numbers of jobs that would be lost] are patently exaggerated,\" Dr Neva Makgetla, a programme manager at the Trade and Industry Policy Strategies , a non-profit independent research institution, told Africa Check. She added that if a similar assumption was made about how many people are employed as a result of a single job in the formal manufacturing industry \"South Africa would have over 34 million employed people.\" Makgetla explained that according to Beverage SA's numbers, the production of sugar-sweetened drinks employs around 14,500 people. It claimed that for each person employed directly to produce the beverages, another 20 find work in the value chain. According to Makgetla, Beverage SA said that 3,400 jobs would be lost in the sugar-sweetened drinks production; 25,200 jobs would be lost in \"upstream\" jobs; 19,200-29,000 jobs in retail and 15,400 job losses directly and indirectly as a result of reduced demand for drinks. Makgetla, who has written a policy brief on the sugar tax, pointed out that t he Beverages Association assumed that producers would not shift to producing \"healthier, untaxed drinks\", which would result in more jobs. She also added that with the funds raised from the tax, treasury could spend more on other programmes that would result in some jobs being created. This effect of the tax was not considered by the Beverages Association , Makgetla said. Need to report net job losses not gross losses Professor Hana Ross , a principal research officer heading up the economics of tobacco control research team within the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) at the University of Cape Town, made the same point. She said she found it difficult to comment on the results without all the data and study methodology from Beverage SA. But based on the information provided to us, she told Africa Check: \"Oxford Economics is not taking into account the fact that money not spent on sugar-sweetened drinks would be spent on other goods and services, thus creating jobs in other sectors.\" By reporting gross job losses and not net job losses, the impact of the policy change is exaggerated, Ross said. We asked the Beverages Association if their study had looked at possible gains in other industries. The study did not do so, Karishma Jivan, media consultant for the association, told Africa Check. She said that the study's focus was on shifts in jobs within the non-alcoholic drinks' industry but it would not include shifts to other products. Consumers quite likely to switch to other drinks So is there a way of working out what the net job losses would look like? Professor Corne van Walbeek, also working at SALDRU, told Africa Check that previous studies looking at this type of question use a \"social accounting matrix\" (SAM) to work out whether jobs have been lost or gained when there is a shift from one industry to another. Whether there are net job gains or losses depends on how machine-driven (capital intensive) the industry is. For example, cigarette manufacturing is very capital intensive, so relatively few jobs in cigarette manufacturing are lost when there is a real or predicted decrease in smoking. Usually, though, when there is a decrease in cigarette-smoking, people spend more on goods that are more labour-intensive to make, with the net result that there are net gains in jobs, Van Walbeek said. A study looking at the effect of the sugar tax in South Africa by Dr Evan Blecher, affiliated with SALDRU and the Economic and Health Policy Research programme of the American Cancer Society, showed that it is quite likely consumers will switch to other drinks. The study compared the effects of the proposed South African tax to a similar tax on sugar-sweetened drinks that Mexico introduced in 2014. There, a tax of 10% per litre on all sugar-sweetened drinks led to a 10% decrease in buying of taxed drinks. It also led to a 7% increase in untaxed drinks (including a 13% increase in plain water purchases). \"The early evidence… suggests that the tax is working,\" the study said.

            "claim [Claim]: \"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:For years, Democrats in North Carolina have pushed to expand Medicaid, a move they say would help hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians afford health insurance. JD Wooten, A Democratic candidate for state Senate, added new fuel to the expansion debate when he blasted his opponent, four-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rick Gunn, in a campaign ad. \"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,\" Wooten said in a caption posted with the video. We wondered if Wooten -- who is running in North Carolina’s District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County -- was correct in his estimates. We decided to take a look. ‘Blocked the expansion’ Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income people. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970 but remains one of 17 states that has not moved to expand it. Medicaid expansion — an action made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act — would give coverage to folks with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, many North Carolinians who do not qualify for the ACA’s health care subsidies or regular Medicaid coverage would be able to escape the so-called coverage gap. Since his election in 2016, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has battled with conservatives in the state’s Republican-led legislature over the issue. There were signs of a bipartisan agreement when Republicans authored a 2017 bill called \"Carolina Cares,\" but the legislation never got off the ground in committee. But while some state Republicans have worked toward compromise, Gunn was among many co-sponsors of a 2013 bill that rejected the ACA’s optional Medicaid expansion, clarified the state’s intent not to operate a state-run health benefit exchange and determined that Medicaid eligibility decisions would be made by the state rather than the federal government. The bill was adopted by a vote of 74 to 40 in the state House and 31-16 in the state Senate and signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. Gunn did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Republican leaders in the legislature have consistently opposed Medicaid expansion, saying North Carolina's share of the rising cost of the program would be too expensive. Senate leader Phil Berger called it a \"budget-busting\" expense, The News & Observer reported in 2017. ‘Half a million people’ The Wooten campaign cited several reports to support the claim that withholding Medicaid expansion was costing half a million North Carolinians health insurance. Among those were articles from the left-leaning North Carolina Justice Center, the pro-expansion Close the Gap NC and the North Carolina Medical Journal, all of which estimated that the expanded benefit would give new coverage to some 500,000 people. Most other reports predicted similar results. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, estimated in 2016 that there are more than 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the actual impact would likely exceed the Census Bureau’s estimate because additional people who are currently insured on ACA exchanges could be expected to transfer to Medicaid if an expansion bill passed. \"The estimate of 500,000 North Carolina residents would be covered by Medicaid is a solid estimate well within consensus, expert opinion,\" Anderson said. Other experts we consulted agreed. \"It appears that about a half a million people is close in the estimate,\" said Lisa Dubay, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning, Washington-based think tank. Predictions and estimates vary, but Wooten’s claim does not seem to oversell the impact Medicaid expansion could have. In a 2017 article, North Carolina Health News reported that the number could even exceed 625,000, according to the state’s Medical Care Advising Committee, a collection of health clinic managers, doctors and administrators. Veterans affected The Wooten campaign did not say how or where it found its estimate for the impact on veterans, but the number may have come from NC Policy Watch, the news arm of the NC Justice Center, which cited a 2013 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. According to that study, approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans would receive Medicaid coverage under an expanded program. Anderson noted, however, that although the estimate resulted from a sound statistical process, it is becoming outdated. Jennifer Haley, a research associate in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who co-authored the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study, also directed us to a more recent report issued by the Urban Institute in 2016. That report estimated that, of the 25,000 veterans projected to be uninsured in North Carolina in 2017, 2,000 would be eligible for but not receiving Medicaid and another 12,000 would fall into the coverage gap, for a total of approximately 14,000 people. This number is short of Wooten’s 23,000, but Anderson explained that the difference between the two studies’ findings is likely due to sampling error and trend changes. \"The caveat with Medicaid expansion is that current veterans who make between 100 and 138 percent (of the federal poverty level) would be able to switch their insurance to Medicaid or gain coverage,\" Anderson said. \"There are no good numbers for that. I think it is safe to say that the most recent study gives a floor of 14,000.\" So Wooten’s estimate may be outdated, but it does not seem unreasonable. And his larger point — that a large number of veterans would gain coverage from Medicaid expansion — holds true. Our ruling In the caption of a video posted to Facebook, Wooten said, \"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans.\" Wooten is mostly correct on the first two charges and close to correct on the third. Gunn co-sponsored a 2013 bill that rejected Medicaid expansion, so even if he was not solely responsible for blocking expansion, he played a role in it. Experts agree this is costing approximately 500,000 North Carolinians the chance at receiving health coverage. That would include many veterans, although the exact number is less clear than Wooten suggested. But given the available research, Wooten’s number seems reasonable. We rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

            "claim [Claim]: \"We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The rise of the Islamic State group and its strategic use of grisly beheadings has stirred a heated debate in this country about the nature of Islam. Some critics say core Muslim beliefs invite violence. Defenders of religious tolerance say extremists represent only a tiny minority of Muslims. Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro jumped in to say the nature of Islam is irrelevant. More important, according to Shapiro, is what its followers believe, \"because that’s what they act upon.\" Through this lens, Shapiro painted a disturbing picture of the religious wellspring for people who fly planes into towers and behead their prisoners. Shapiro is an editor-at-large with the conservative website Breitbart.com and cofounded a conservative media analysis group, TruthRevolt. In a video, Shapiro blended survey data and population statistics for 15 countries. A good example of his thesis about Islam is in the way he talked about Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation. \"It’s got almost 205 million Muslims,\" Shapiro said. \"According to one 2009 poll, it showed almost 50 percent of Indonesians support strict Sharia law, not just in Indonesia but in a lot of countries. And 70 percent blame the United States, Israel or somebody else for 9/11. You make that calculation, it’s about 143 million people who are radicalized. You scared yet? We’re just getting started.\" To get to 143 million \"radicalized\" Muslims, Shapiro took the 70 percent of Indonesia’s Muslims who blamed someone other than al-Qaida for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shapiro then made similar extrapolations using polling data for a number of other countries, often measuring support for Sharia law -- codes of behavior in Islam. Then Shapiro summed up and applied the percentage of \"radicalized Muslims\" from the 15 nations to a number of other Muslim-majority countries and, with 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, reached a shocking conclusion. \"We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth,\" Shapiro said. \"That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority.\" Shapiro spoke with great self-assurance, but as we looked at his claim that most Muslims are radicals, we were left scratching our heads. In the first place, Shapiro consistently used the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he could tag with the \"radical\" label. Secondly, he used a broad definition of radical. To choose one main example, there are many varieties of how people interpret Sharia law and support for it says little about a person’s specific beliefs. Other numbers tell a different story Shapiro cited the work of the Pew Research Center in some of his analysis and much of our work relies on the same source. We tried to reach Shapiro and were unsuccessful. In about half of the countries he assessed, Shapiro focused on support for Sharia law. According tothe Council on Foreign Relations, \"Sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life, including daily routines, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings.\" It is a moral code that covers marriage, crime and business. Different branches of Islam use different versions of the law. Some elements are widely accepted, such as the immorality of fraud. But for countries and sects that follow the harshest versions in which thieves have their hands cut off and unfaithful women are stoned to death, the opposition from the West, and parts of the Muslim world as well, is strong and visceral. For Shapiro, support for any form of Sharia law means one thing -- the believer is a radical. Accordingly, Shapiro looks at a place like Pakistan and says that 76 percent of Muslims want Sharia law in all Muslim countries. Pakistan has 179 million Muslims, therefore, \"that is another 135.4 million radicals.\" But looking at a 2013 Pew report on Muslims, we found that the picture is more complicated. Pew reported that 84 percent of Pakistani Muslims wanted Sharia law, but of those, nearly two-thirds said it should only apply to Muslims. Run those numbers through and you get about 54 million Muslims who think all Pakistanis should be subject to Sharia law. That’s about 60 percent fewer than Shapiro said. We are not saying that Pakistan has 54 million radical Muslims. Our point is that more detailed polling data changes the results a great deal. Shapiro chose one yardstick. Other analysts could with at least as much justification choose another. The impact of which question is used becomes even clearer if we look at support for suicide bombings against civilian targets. Shapiro said actual terrorists draw \"moral, financial and religious support from those who are not terrorists themselves.\" Even if you believe Shapiro, it doesn’t mean that attitudes towards terrorism are irrelevant. Pew asked Muslims if they supported suicide bombings against civilians. In Pakistan, 13 percent of Muslims said such attacks in defense of Islam could often or sometimes be justified. If that’s your definition of radicals, then Pakistan has about 23 million of them. Hardly a small number, but it’s a far cry from the 135 million Shapiro counted. The following table shows how using reasonable alternative measures of radicalism, Shapiro’s majority can become a distinct minority. You can see how Shapiro reached his totals by watching the video. Country Population (millions) Radical total (Shapiro, millions) Alternative pct. Alternative total (millions) Indonesia 205 143 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 14.4 Egypt 80 55.2 Pew: 29% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.2 Pakistan 179 135.4 Pew: 13% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.3 Bangladesh 149 121.9 Pew: 26% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 38.7 Nigeria 75.7 53.7 Pew: 22% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 16.7 Iran 74.8 62.1 ICP/Charney: 47% would abolish the morality police. 35.2 Turkey 74.7 23.9 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 11.2 Morocco 32.4 24.6 Pew: 9% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.9 Iraq 31.1 24.3 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.2 Afghanistan 24 24 Pew: 39% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 9.4 Jordan 6.4 3.8 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1 Palestinian areas 4.3 3.83 Pew: 40% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1.7 France 4.7 1.6 No alternate used 1.6 Great Britain 2.8 2.2 Manchester Policy: 2% expressed some support for terrorism. 0.06 United States 2.6 0.5 Pew: In 2009, 8% said suicide bombings could sometimes be justified. 0.2 Total 946.5 680.03 181.76 Percent of total 72% 19% To be clear, we’re not saying there are 181 million radical Muslims. We’re simply saying by applying different but reasonable criteria to the same data, you can reach a vastly different result. Sharia ≠ radical Given that Shapiro used support for Sharia law in 7 of the 15 countries as a marker for radicalism, we should note that the experts we reached urged a more cautious approach. Pew found that when you ask Muslims about specific elements in Sharia law, support shifts. According to James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes. But ask them about corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates, and support drops off considerably. \"The key takeaway is that Muslims differ in what they mean by Sharia and how they want it applied,\" Bell said. Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy advocacy group for Arab Americans, said most Muslims don’t think about every element of sharia. \"It indicates a degree of nominal faithfulness,\" Zogby said. If I say I support the law in the abstract, it doesn’t commit me to supporting various and assorted aspects.\" In two countries, Shapiro focused onsupport for honor killings. Zogby said that as cruel as honor killings are, they are not tied to beliefs that underlie beheadings and suicide bombings. \"One has nothing to do with the other,\" Zogby said. Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in quantitative methods and politics at the University of Manchester, England, studied polls in that country in the wake of the 2005 bus and subway bombings. Sobolewska found enormous variation in Muslim responses depending on small changes in the wording of questions. \"What we receive as a true picture of what Muslims think is mostly an artifact of what they get asked,\" Sobolewska wrote. We should note that we found no solid estimate of the number of radical Muslims worldwide. For example, a 2014 report on jihadist terrorism from the Bipartisan Policy Center did not quantify the size of the jihadist population. Our ruling Shapiro said that a majority of Muslims are radicals. To make his numbers work, he had to cherry-pick certain results from public opinion surveys. Given the choice between two possible percentages, he chose the higher one. Shapiro also relied heavily on the idea that anyone who supported sharia law is a radical. Some of the best polling work shows that Muslim beliefs are much more nuanced. Some countries where high percentages of Muslims support Sharia law show low support for suicide attacks on civilians. Large fractions of Muslims that endorse sharia law do not want it imposed on others. The meaning of Sharia law varies from sect to sect and nation to nation. Shapiro’s definition of radical is so thin as to be practically meaningless and so too are the numbers he brings to bear. We rate the claim False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The claim was published by a New Zealand-based Facebook user here on September 29, 2020. It has been shared more than 490 times. The graphic features an image of Judith Collins, which has been manipulated to show her wearing a sailor costume. She can be seen holding a sign which states: “bottled water companies don’t produce water, they produce plastic bottles”. Text at the bottom of the graphic reads: “Judith Collins knows this because Collin’s husband is a director of Oravida, a Chinese based water bottling company that produces millions of plastic bottles here in New Zealand. Why do you think that Collins wants the R.M.Act gone?” Judith Collins is the leader of the New Zealand National Party. Oravida is actually a New Zealand-based company that exports water and dairy products to China. “R.M.Act” refers to the Resource Amendment Management Act (2020). Collins said she would repeal the act and replace it with two new pieces of law - Environment Standards Act and the Urban Planning and Development Act - if she wins in this October’s election, the New Zealand Herald reported on July 17, 2020. The graphic has been shared hundreds of times in other Facebook posts, including here, here, here, here and here. The claim, however, lacks important context. Collins’ husband David Wong-Tung was previously a director of Oravida, but as of October 2020, he no longer holds the position, according to filings on the New Zealand Companies Register website. Oravida is listed as having one major shareholder, Kauri NZ Investment Limited. Wong-Tung is not listed as a director of that company either, as stated here on the Companies Register website. A spokesperson for Judith Collins told AFP her husband left the company on June 13, 2017. Company history published here on the New Zealand Companies register corroborates this. Wong-Tung’s previous position as director resulted in Collins being accused of a conflict of interest after local media reported she dined with the company’s bosses and attended their headquarters in Shanghai in 2014.\n",

            "[Evidences]:CLAIM COVID-19 became a leading cause of death globally by the end of May 2020. more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Gavin Wood, Flourish, 31 May 2020 DETAILS Accurate: The mortality statistics for various causes of death represented in the graph are generally accurate as based on Health Feedback’s independent analysis. Lacks context: Although sources are indicated, the post does not clearly explain which database was used for which cause of death, nor what were the inclusion or exclusion criteria in the choice of causes of death to be taken into account. KEY TAKE AWAY A graphical representation of the number of human deaths from COVID-19 compared with other common causes of death, including disease, violence, accidents, and drug use, shows that the COVID-19 death count has risen sharply in the first five months of 2020. It now outpaces important causes of death such as malaria. However, it still ranks far behind the leading causes of death worldwide such as stroke and heart or pulmonary disease. FULL CLAIM: A widely shared graph suggests that COVID-19 is a leading cause of death, responsible for approximately 345,000 deaths by 24 May 2020, ahead of well-known causes of death such as malaria (~256,000), malnutrition (~209,000), and homicides (~162,000). An animated bar graph circulating on social media went viral in June 2020 and received more than 100,000 interactions on Facebook. The graph claims to report the number of deaths that have occurred worldwide from several causes, including COVID-19, between 1 January 2020 and 24 May 2020. In the animation, the COVID-19 death count exhibits a strong acceleration, progressively outpacing the number of deaths from other causes, including top-ranked malaria, and ultimately reaching 345,059 deaths. Health Feedback finds the graphical representation to be mostly accurate, although some methodological aspects are lacking and others are somewhat misleading. The data used to create the graph come from three sources: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, Worldometer, and the COVID Data GitHub repository of Johns Hopkins University. The GBD study estimated the number of deaths from various causes worldwide through 2017. The graph compares 2017 numbers for non-COVID-19 causes of death to 2020 data for COVID-19. Because the graph is not accompanied by a detailed explanation of the methods used to calculate the numbers used for each disease, Health Feedback conducted its own analysis to determine whether the graph presents accurate data and to attempt to discern the methods used. First, it appears that the graph’s creator divided the annual number of deaths from each cause, except COVID-19, by the number of days in a year to yield a daily death rate. Evidence of this method is the observation that the number of deaths from non-COVID-19 causes increase at a constant daily rate (linearly). Second, we compared the graph’s daily death rate for non-COVID-19 causes with daily death rates which we calculated from the 2017 GBD data (see our comparison in Table 1). We also compared the daily rate with another database provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) which summarizes the number of deaths from main causes in 2016. Our analysis shows that the daily death rates calculated using these two different data sets were of the same scale as those shown in the graph. For many causes of death, the differences between our calculated average daily death rates obtained from the GBD dataset and those shown in the graph were around 5% or less. However, we found much larger differences for several causes of death, such as malnutrition (56% lower using the GBD data) and natural disasters (25% higher)@. The results obtained from the WHO database, however, show a greater difference. Our comparison of daily death rates due to non-COVID-19 causes was complicated by the fact that some cause-of-death categories listed in the GBD database did not match the categories presented in the graph. For instance, the GBD database combines the number of deaths from conflict and terrorism, whereas the graph presents these two causes of death separately. Also, the GBD database does not provide the number of deaths from influenza%. Given that the graph does not explicitly state which dataset and which death categories it presents, it is not possible to fully validate the data. In addition, the results obtained from the WHO database showed a greater difference (Table 1). This highlights how the choice of databases can affect the outcome of the calculation. However, on the whole our quantifications are not dramatically different from those shown in the graph for most causes of death as they are all within the same scale and the relative ranking of the different causes of death is only slightly affected. [Table updated on 02 July 2020 for readability] Moving on to COVID-19 deaths, there are a few problems with the way the data are presented in the graph. First, the number of COVID-19 deaths are presented differently in the graph than the other causes of death. Instead of an average daily rate, COVID-19 deaths are reported as the actual number of daily deaths. This could give a false impression that the death rate from non-COVID-19 deaths is never higher than that for COVID-19. Overall, the average daily death rate from COVID-19 through 24 May is currently higher than that of the other listed diseases, but the rates may change by the end of the year. To evaluate the accuracy of the COVID-19 deaths reported in the graph, we summed the daily number of deaths from each country reported in the COVID Data GitHub repository. We found that the total number of deaths was 346,583 on 24 May 2020, which is very close to the 345,059 deaths reported in the graph and the 346,976 deaths reported by Worldometer. Figure 1 below shows the cumulative number of actual deaths each day for COVID-19 along with the cumulative number of average daily deaths that Health Feedback calculated for the other causes presented in the graph. Despite the differences between our quantification and the graph’s numbers, as discussed above, we can see that the dynamic remains similar—the number of COVID-19 deaths displays a marked increase and eventually outpaces the number of deaths from all other causes. Despite the relative agreement between Health Feedback’s calculated numbers and those presented in the graph, the graph is a bit misleading because it fails to include the leading causes of death worldwide. A WHO survey from 2016 established the top ten causes of death worldwide, the first one being ischemic heart disease (i.e., reduced blood flow to the heart such as from the narrowing of coronary arteries due to plaque buildup). Without these leading causes of death, the graph exaggerates the magnitude of COVID-19 deaths and their relative importance. When the top 10 leading causes of death are added to the graph (see Figure 2 below), the relative contribution of COVID-19 towards mortality worldwide is much less impressive. However, this should not be interpreted as a statement that COVID-19 does not constitute a significant public health threat. As the original graph shows, the increase in COVID-19 mortality exhibited a dramatic increase during the first quarter of 2020. As Health Feedback and others have reported, the COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for a significant excess number of deaths worldwide. In summary, the number of deaths represented in the graph are mostly correct, as we found results within the same order of magnitude for most causes of death using our own independent verification. The dynamics of COVID-19 mortality are also correct, exhibiting a sharp acceleration during the first five months of 2020. However, the method used to present the data in the animated graph is unclear. For example, the graph does not specify which dataset was used for each cause of death. This makes it impossible for others to fully validate the claim. In addition, the author appears to have cherry-picked the causes of death displayed in the graph, leaving out the top 10 leading causes. This selection graphically enhances the importance of COVID-19 as a cause of death and may mislead the casual reader. Overall, comparing causes of death can be a tricky exercise as it depends on how deaths are categorized. For example, COVID-19 is a specific disease caused by a specific virus. Comparing COVID-19 deaths side-by-side with, for example, total cancer deaths, which is a much wider category encompassing many cancer types, is not really relevant. It is preferable to compare the number of deaths between death categories of similar scopes. Our analysis also shows, by comparing the results from the WHO database and the GBD database, that one must be careful when pooling data from different databases as they may have used different methodologies to compile the data which may have produced significantly different results. NOTES @ Worldometer reports a different number of deaths for malnutrition, with more than 5,200,000 deaths from hunger this year as of 21 June 2020. However, this count still does not match the number reported in the graph. % Worldometer reports 658 deaths daily from influenza as of 21 June 2020. This is a 16% discrepancy with the daily number of deaths reported in the graph.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Republicans have been complaining for weeks that President Barack Obama is trying to rush his health care reform bill through Congress. To make their point now, they've gone to the dogs.In an Aug. 13 op-ed in theWashington Examiner, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour invoked Bo, the White House dog, to illustrate how quickly Obama has tried to pass the 1,000-page bill. Barbour, who chairs the Republican Governors Association and has been mentioned as a possible 2012 presidential contender, wrote, \"It took Obama six months to pick out a family dog. Cramming health care reform down the country's throat in a fraction of that time scares people who have been told, accurately, the various bills contain a billion-dollar combination of tax increases and Medicare spending cuts.\"To judge whether Obama tried to pass the bill \"in a fraction\" of the time it took him to choose the Portuguese water dog requires examining thetimelinefor both the health care bill and the selection of Bo. And that's not as easy it might sound.We could choose various dates for the beginning of the dog selection. We could go as far back as Obama's mention of his dog promise in an interview withMen's Healthmagazine in August 2008, or as recently as his inauguration on Jan. 20, when he and his family moved into the White House. But we believe it's fair to say the process started with the Obama election night celebration on Nov. 4, 2008, when Obama declared that his daughters Sasha and Malia \"have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.\" It was at that point that speculation began in earnest about what kind of dog they might get.The end date for the puppy hunt is a little imprecise as well. According to the definitiveWashington Postaccount of the dog search, Bo had a \"clandestine White House visit in which he won over the Obama girls and their parents\" some time in March or early April. Not knowing exactly when it took place, we'll date the end of the search on April 12, when word of the new pooch became breaking news.Total elapsed time: 160 days. That's a bit less than the six months Barbour cited, but we think it's a reasonable estimate and won't knock Barbour for being a bit off.Now, on to more serious matters: health care reform.Here too we face some choices about the start and end dates. We could go all the way back to May 29, 2007, when candidate Obama first unveiled a comprehensive health care proposal in Iowa. Or we could use March 5, 2009, when Obama invited lawmakers and industry leaders to the White House for a forum that included \"breakout sessions\" and a question-and-answer period to discuss the possible elements of health care legislation. Or we could use July 14, 2009, when House Democratic leaders formally introduced H.R. 3200, the massive bill that's still under discussion.After much internal discussion, we settled on March 5, the date of the forum. That was the point when the Obama administration signaled that health care reform was a key priority. Obama told participants that the forum was \"the first discussion in this effort, but it was not the last.\"As for the end date, Democratic leaders and the White House tried to have the bills passed by the House and the Senate by the start of the August recess — July 31, 2009, for the House and Aug. 7, 2009, for the Senate. It didn't happen, but that seems to be what Barbour was referring to when he said Obama had tried to \"cram\" the legislation through. (Barbour's office did not respond to our request for more details.)If you start the clock on March 5 and stop it at Aug. 7, it works out to 156 days. That is just a smidgen less than the 160 days it took to find Bo, but it's very close, so it is a stretch to say, as Barbour did, that the health care effort took \"a fraction\" of the time it took to find a dog.A more favorable comparison from Barbour's perspective would be to start the clock with the introduction of the House bill on July 14. That would make the total duration of the debate a mere 25 days. Using those dates, Barbour would be right to call it a fraction of the 160-day-long dog search. However, choosing such a late start date strikes us as cherry-picking. The health care discussion among lawmakers, the media and the public was well under way by July 14, and the details of the bill had been swirling for weeks, even if they were not in legislative language yet.Ultimately, determining whether Barbour is right depends on which dates you choose. Let us propose an additional caveat, however. No one ever promised that a bill would be ready for the president to sign by the start of August recess. Even if the original goal was to have a bill through both chambers by then, it would still require a House-Senate conference committee to iron out what were sure to be significant differences. Once lawmakers managed to hammer out a consensus bill, both chambers would need time to debate the new measure, pass the bill individually, and send it on to the president. That would likely take several weeks.Given this reality, another conceivable ending date would actually be Oct. 30, 2009 — the target date for the House to adjourn. Using that as the end date, the duration of the health care debate would be 240 days (when starting with March 5, which would be much longer than picking the dog) or 109 days (when starting with July 14, or shorter than the dog selection but not really \"a fraction.\").So this is one where reasonable people can reach different conclusions. We examined three scenarios and found his claim is only right under the most extreme one — when you start the clock at the July introduction of the bill and stop it at the August recess. But under what we consider the most realistic scenario, starting with the March forum and ending with the October adjournment, Barbour is wrong. So we find his claim Barely True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: The last private rocket launch \"cost $80 million. If the government did it, the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money. I mean, literally.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:President Donald Trump looked to the stars, or at least near-Earth orbit, to cite yet another example of the private sector getting things done better and cheaper than the government. With rocket models decorating the table where Trump and his Cabinet met March 8, Trump singled out the private operators. \"Rich guys, they love rocket ships, and that's good,\" Trump said. \"That's better than us paying for it. And I noticed the prices of the last one, that they said it cost $80 million. If the government did it, the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money. I mean, literally.\" We thought about Trump’s cost-multiplier estimate and wondered if it would cost NASA $3.2 billion to do what the private rockets do. The comparison is a stretch for several reasons, but as Jason Davis at the Planetary Society put it, the main one is \"it’s sort of like comparing a Ford Focus to a Cadillac Escalade.\" The private rockets don’t need to go higher than low-Earth orbit. SpaceX, for example, carries supplies to the International Space Station, which is about 250 miles above the earth. With the shorter distance, the rockets can be smaller. The SpaceX Falcon 9 is about 230 feet high. NASA has left that closer-in zone to the private firms since 2006. Its field of play reaches further out, to the moon and beyond. NASA has been developing the Space Launch System, a veritable beast of a rocket where the shortest configuration is 322 feet tall. With that in mind, let’s look at the dollars. The list price of the most basic SpaceX rocket, the Falcon 9, is $62 million. If you want more lift, the Falcon Heavy goes for $90 million. So $80 million is a reasonable midpoint. Davis noted, though, that prices can run higher. \"The Air Force paid $97 million for the Falcon 9 that launched the DSCOVR climate satellite,\" he said. The key here is that this price tag covers the cost of producing and operating the rocket for each launch. Part of the money goes to recover the cost of designing and developing the rocket, and for that, it’s important to note that NASA and the companies shared the tab. In 2011, to ensure that two companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, had the capacity to supply the International Space Station, Congress provided $821 million, or about 44 percent of what it took to develop and test the commercial systems. That government investment made it easier for the firms to be commercially viable. Joshua Colwell, professor of planetary science and assistant director of the Florida Space Institute, told us having a guaranteed buyer also helped. \"SpaceX got to where it is in part thanks to lots of government contracts to send supplies to the International Space Station,\" Colwell said. NASA is building the Space Launch System to do much more than the private rockets. It will be safe enough to carry astronauts in a capsule called Orion — a separate huge expense in its own right — or pure cargo. As for distance, the minimum range is the moon, or about 239,000 miles from Earth, in contrast to the 250 miles distance to the International Space Station. An artist’s rendition of the Space Launch System carrying the Orion capsule in to space. (NASA) This big rocket and its Orion capsule are scheduled for their first voyage in 2020. So, as a practical matter, there is no ongoing series of launches to compare to the private operators. There are a few ways to tackle the question. Davis at the Planetary Society looked at the development cost. \"The Space Launch System currently costs NASA more than $2 billion per year, and it's still under development,\" Davis said. \"It will go on two test flights over the next five years, so I suppose you could calculate that you're paying about $5 billion per flight.\" On the other hand, this big rocket could be used more often over a longer stretch of time. The website Ars Technica is into rocket science and rocket budgets. In 2016, it estimated development and operation costs of $60 billion for the rocket, the Orion capsule and infrastructure on the ground at the Kennedy Space Center over the next two decades. Assuming one flight each year, the package cost of rocket, capsule and ground operations would come to $3 billion per flight. Ars Technica relayed a much slimmer price tag from NASA manager Bill Hill. In 2016, Hill said he was aiming for an annual cost of $2 billion a year with two flights annually by the end of the 2020s. That would drive the cost down to $1 billion per flight. Again, this is neither certain nor directly comparable to today’s private launches. Colwell puts no stock in Trump’s 40-50 times estimate. At the same time, he takes the larger point. \"It is probably true that SpaceX is cheaper than an equivalent government-developed rocket, but there is no equivalent government-developed rocket.\" We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said that at $80 million per launch, private rockets are about 40 to 50 times cheaper than NASA would spend if it did \"the same thing.\" The $80 million figure is roughly accurate, but the key flaw in the statement is that NASA is not doing the same thing. As part of a policy decision made a decade ago, NASA has left the shorter distance work to the private sector while it focuses on getting to the moon and beyond. We found a wide range of approaches and estimates of what it would cost to launch the Space Launch System on a year-in-year-out basis. The answers on the high end backed up Trump’s remark. The answers on the low end suggested he exaggerated. But fundamentally, this is a comparison between a Ford Fusion and a Cadillac Escalade. One will be much more expensive than the other, but they are used in very different ways. We rate this claim Half True. PolitiFact Democratic guest columnist and former U.S. Rep. David Altmire took issue with this fact-check, saying Trump's literal words \"were simply too far off to earn the benefit of the doubt\" and should have earned a False rating.

            "[Evidences]:Critics accused Georgia’s new Arizona-style illegal immigration enforcement law of violating civil and human rights. \"Inhumane,\" they called it, and \"the civil rights issue of the 21st century.\"The Anti-Defamation League also accused the law of crimes against the economy. The law, they said, is \"anti-business.\" Major cities and organizations voted to boycott or avoid travel to Arizona after that state passed its tough law last year.\"Convention and tourism business will likely dip, as it did in Arizona, where it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues since passage of the Arizona immigration laws,\" the ADL said in a news release April 15.The claim that estimates show Arizona lost $100 million in hospitality industry revenue intrigued us. Is the ADL right?Atlanta business leaders fear it is. Last month, the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau's executive committee unanimously passed a resolution opposing Georgia’s law, called House Bill 87.Arizona’s law requires police to ask a person about his immigration status if they have \"reasonable suspicion\" he or she is in the country illegally. One provision of Georgia’s law gives officers more authority to check a suspect’s immigration status.Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a separate 2007 Arizona law requiring certain employers to use the federal database E-Verify to check whether their new employees are eligible to work in this country legally.We asked Bill Nigut, the ADL’s Southeast regional director, for evidence backing his group’s claim about economic losses. He referred us to news accounts from Foxnews.com, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Phoenix Business Journal.Two May 2010 articles from The Wall Street Journal said the city of Phoenix estimated Arizona’s immigration crackdown could cost it $90 million in convention and hotel business.The Foxnews.com article cited a report from the Center for American Progress, a progressive group that thinks Arizona’s immigration approach is bad for the economy, that put the loss at $141 million. The rest did not give specific estimates but quoted experts who said the controversy hurt Arizona’s tourism business.We took a closer look at the Phoenix and Center for American Progress estimates.Both have limitations. Hotels and convention centers are not required to report lost business to the city or the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association, which did some of the research on which estimates are based. Not all major convention sites are part of the association, and the group did not poll its members for more data.Plus, it’s hard to measure how many conventions would have booked in Arizona if there were no boycott.The city of Phoenix released its $90 million economic loss projection in May 2010. The figure was based on a list of about 20 events whose organizers either canceled or expressed concerns over the state’s illegal immigration crackdown, according to The Arizona Republic.The figure represents how much conventioneers would have spent in the region over five years. Actual boycott losses are unclear.So far, four groups have canceled their events at the city-run Phoenix Convention Center at an estimated loss of $26 million in business, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. They would have brought 18,100 delegates, who on average spend $1,451 each on hotels, restaurants, entertainment, transportation and other expenses. Phoenix’s figure does not include losses from conventions canceled at venues that are not city-run or future declines from events that never booked. It also does not account for indirect losses (the money businesses would have spent on supplies to serve conventioneers) or induced losses (household spending by people who would have been employed).Now, we look at figures from the Center for American Progress. It contracted with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., an established economic research and analysis firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., to determine the boycott’s impact on the state’s convention industry.The November 2010 report found the state had already lost $141 million in direct spending on hotels and lodging, restaurants and other areas. With indirect and induced spending, Arizona lost $253 million in economic output.Jim Rounds, an economist with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., noted that while tourism did lose money because of the cancellations, a portion of the declines were likely due to cuts in state funding for tourism advertising. Also, because few businesses would comment on the record on their losses, his estimate captures only \"roughly half\" of the total impact on tourism from the Arizona controversy.We asked economists Bruce Seaman of Georgia State University and Tom Smith of Emory University’s Goizueta Business School to review the Center for American Progress study. They brought up shortcomings that were similar to ones Rounds acknowledged but otherwise said the analysis made sense.Let’s sum up:The ADL’s claim that \"it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues\" has some significant shortcomings. No group the ADL cited placed the losses at $100 million. The Center for American Progress placed the direct losses more than 40 percent higher. Phoenix’s estimate was 10 percent lower, limited to city losses and expected to take place over five years.These, however, are all just estimates and projections. The ADL’s point was that the tourism industry has and will lose millions of dollars.The overall idea that Arizona will likely lose big money because of the new immigration law is correct. The ADL statement, however, leaves out important details and context.That fits our definition of Half-True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Editor's note,Dec. 4, 2018: This item has been updated to note that Wisconsin is the only state, among those who did not do the Obamacare expansion, without a so-called coverage gap. Both sides in the political divide have used health care as a major talking point, with heated arguments ranging from coverage of pre-existing conditions to Medicare for All proposals. Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, has raised an issue that piqued the interest of PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"We have the number one health care system in the country,\" said Kooyenga, referring to the state of Wisconsin. \"Everyone in poverty now has health care.\" Kooyenga’s comment came Nov. 7, 2018, on the \"Mark Belling Show\" on WISN-AM. The day before, Kooyenga had won the seat that Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir gave up to run unsuccessfully against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Let’s see what Kooyenga is talking about. The evidence When asked to provide backup for the claim, Kooyenga staffer Rachel Vander Wiele pointed to a Sept. 2, 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin item that rated a similar claim from Gov. Scott Walker. The claim: That even though Walker \"turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,\" because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history \"everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid.\" We rated the statement Mostly True. The item noted that 145,000 people gained coverage as a result of the extra action. What’s more, Wisconsin is the only state among those that did not do the Obamacare expansion without a coverage gap, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health-care-related matters. Vander Wiele also cited a Nov. 1, 2017, news item issued by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine: \"Wisconsin has best health care quality in the nation, federal agency says.\" The item noted that according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Wisconsin had the best health care quality in the nation, based on a ranking of 130 measures. Digging into the rankings It is true that Wisconsin was ranked No. 1 in 2017. But the information is outdated. In the latest such report, released in September 2018, Maine ranked first, with Wisconsin coming in fourth. Reasons cited for Wisconsin’s dip included a high rate of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for opioid-related conditions. Stephanie Marquis, vice president of communications for the Wisconsin Hospital Association, noted that the state has generally fared well in the AHRQ rankings -- first in the nation in 2006, 2008 and 2017 and second in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2015. Marquis also pointed out that the 2018 ranking was still tops among Midwestern states. Jon Dyck, supervising analyst at the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, said ranking the health care systems of states is a complicated issue. \"The results depend a great deal on what is being measured and how various measures are aggregated to derive a final score,\" Dyck said. \"Everyone in poverty now has health care\" According to the Kaiser Family Foundation more than two million poor, uninsured adults nationally fall into the \"coverage gap\" that results from state decisions not to expand Medicaid. That means their income is above current Medicaid eligibility, but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits. These individuals would be eligible for Medicaid had their state chosen to expand coverage. Because Wisconsin sets the income limit for Medicaid at the federal poverty level, does that mean that everyone under the poverty line has coverage? There is a small wrinkle here. Remember: While Walker focused on people \"covered\" by Medicaid, as in eligible for it, Kooyenga stated \"Everyone in poverty now has health care.\" Dyck, of the state’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau, noted that while a person may meet financial requirements to enroll in Medicaid, there are other requirements that are not tied to finances. As an example, he cited a person who immigrates to the United States \"and resides in Wisconsin is generally not eligible for Medicaid until five years after entering the country, even if he or she becomes a naturalized citizen and meets the income eligibility standard.\" Meanwhile, there are other sources that show there are people without insurance in the state. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey, an estimated 309,404 people out of a population of more than 5.7 million, or 5.4 percent, are uninsured. The Census Bureau also estimates about 60,000 residents under the federal poverty level are uninsured. Our rating Kooyenga said Wisconsin has \"the number one health care system in the country. Everyone in poverty now has health care.\" The state did receive a top rating in 2017, but in a more recent rating by the same agency the state had slipped to number four. Meanwhile, changes under Walker mean that everyone in poverty (and somewhat above) is eligible for coverage under Medicaid. But clearly there are still residents who do not have insurance. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.\n",

However, this policy change -- reported by The Times newspaper in the UK on November 23 -- has not been announced worldwide. \"At present, the UK is the only country to announce it will ease the restrictions on carrying liquids,\" Kalliopi Lazari, senior communications specialist for the International Air Transport Association, told AFP. In the US, liquid volume restrictions are still in effect nationwide -- and there is no publicly announced plan to change them. The UK's policy change comes with enhanced X-ray scanning at airport security checkpoints. The machines will rely on computed tomography (CT) technology that produces 3-D images for screening passengers' items. Some airports outside the UK, including Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands, have also rolled out CT technology to ease their liquid carry-on policies at security checkpoints. A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesperson told AFP on December 21 that CT technology is being deployed at airports in the US as well, but that \"we are years away from announcing a change to the current liquids rule.\" The spokesperson added: \"Passengers with exceptions, such as people traveling with infants, nursing parents or travelers with medical needs, may carry on liquids exceeding 3.4 ounces. However, TSA requires additional screening to ensure the safety of these liquids. Travelers in this group should notify security of their medically necessary liquids.\" Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt told AFP that \"other countries will carefully study the results of the UK,\" but \"even if the UK policy proves to be successful, it is uncertain whether other countries will follow suit.\" Liquid carry-on rules were tightened internationally after British authorities in August 2006 foiled an alleged plot to blow up US-bound airliners using explosives smuggled in drinks and other containers.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says state schools superintendent candidate Don Pridemore \"voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history\" and for \"$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now has long been critical of state Rep. Don Pridemore, especially when blasting bills he authored that would affect police treatment of immigrants and require voters to present photo identification.Now that Pridemore, a Republican from suburban Milwaukee, is challenging state schools superintendent Tony Evers in the April 2013 election, One Wisconsin Now has made a new attack.In a news release Dec. 3, 2012, the day Pridemore announced his candidacy, the Madison-based group claimed Pridemore \"voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history -- nearly $2 billion between K-12 and the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical College Systems -- in favor of $2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.\"Both the funding cuts and tax cuts parts of this claim are similar to claims we've rated before. How do they stack up when combined?Education funding cutsTo back the first part of the claim, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross cited a February 2012 Truth-O-Meter item that evaluated a nearly identical statement.In that item, we rated as True an attack by Kathleen Falk that GOP Gov. Scott Walker enacted \"the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history.\" Falk ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to challenge Walker in the June 2012 recall election.We found that Walker’s 2011-2013 state budget, which Pridemore voted for, cut $1.11 billion in state aid to school districts, the university system and technical colleges.But that’s far short of the nearly $2 billion that One Wisconsin Now claimed.Moreover, the claim ignores the fact that school districts and other local governments were able to offset the cuts by forcing employees to pay a greater share of their health care and pension costs. One Wisconsin Now highlights just one side of the equation.Ross said his math puts the total cut at nearly $2 billion because the budget reduced by $800 million the amount of property taxes that local school districts can levy.But limiting a school district’s ability to raise taxes is not the same as a straight budget cut, which is what One Wisconsin Now claims in its attack on Pridemore.Tax cutsThe second part of the group’s claim against Pridemore -- that he voted for \"$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy\" -- is similar to a One Wisconsin Now claim we rated in July 2011.In that item, the group said Walker’s budget has \"tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.\" We rated the statement Half True.We found that Walker’s budget -- along with other tax provisions adopted in 2011 -- will result in a total reduction of $2.3 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. However, while many tax breaks go to corporations and individuals with higher incomes, some go to small businesses and to average taxpayers.Pridemore and other Republicans have argued that the tax cuts give incentives to employers to create more jobs. What’s more, One Wisconsin Now pairs up the 10-year figure with an annual one for school funding, skewing the comparison.Our ratingOne Wisconsin Now said Pridemore voted for \"the largest cuts to public education in our state history\" -- nearly $2 billion -- and for \"$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.\"Pridemore voted for the largest cuts to education -- but they amount to about $1 billion, not nearly $2 billion, over two years. And Pridemore voted for $2.3 billion in tax breaks, but they don’t benefit only corporations and the wealthy.We rate One Wisconsin Now’s claim Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"The Congressional Budget Office has found that (the stimulus) bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:A week after the economic stimulus bill was signed into law, it continues to come under fire from Republicans who say it won't do enough to jump-start the economy. In an op-ed in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, Mark Sanford, the Republican governor of South Carolina, wrote that the bill would not only fail to boost the economy, but that it would actually make things worse. \"Now that the so-called stimulus plan is law, we're left with one question: Will this package help us or hurt us? Unfortunately, I believe it is the latter, for a few reasons,\" wrote Sanford. \"First, this package will ultimately mean less, not more, economic activity. The Congressional Budget Office has found that this bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019. That translates into our economy losing tens of billions of dollars.\" When we asked Sanford's communications director to provide the source for his data, he pointed us to a Feb. 4 letter from CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf to senators and House members that projects the impact of the stimulus bill. We should note that the CBO is a nonpartisan agency that has the thankless task of projecting the cost and impact of bills being considered by Congress. CBO does not take a position on legislation and its estimates are widely quoted (and occasionally, misquoted) by both parties. The Feb. 4 letter that Sanford cites is about the Senate version of the stimulus bill. It gives an overview of CBO's estimates. (It's worth noting that there is a newer estimate written Feb. 11 that has slightly different numbers, but the patterns are the same. And CBO is likely to update that estimate in the near future.) The letter says, in the cautious language of government economists, that the stimulus bill would indeed stimulate the economy. It says that the Senate version of the bill would boost GDP — the key measurement of the economy's output — by 1.2 percent to 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010. The bill would add 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. And it would reduce the unemployment rate 0.7 percentage points to 2.1 percentage points below the baseline forecast of 8.7 percent. The letter says that the stimulus, intended as a short-term program to get the economy moving again, would have short-term effects. So if the letter shows the stimulus bill will boost the economy, how can Sanford claim there is a decline in 2019? He's quoting a single number out of context and distorting what it means. His office pointed us to a section of the letter that discusses the long-term impact. It says that by 2019 the Senate legislation \"would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net.\" That's not worded very clearly and it has led many people — including many conservative critics — to misunderstand what CBO meant. Bill Beach, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that was referring to the long-term impact of the debt from the stimulus bill on the economy. CBO estimates that all of the debt from the stimulus could have effect of \"crowding out\" private investment, meaning that investors wouldn't put as much of their money into private capital, which has an negative impact on the economy. But the effect is relatively small. It would lower the GDP from its \"baseline\" level by only 0.1 to 0.3 percent. And contrary to the way Sanford said it, the economy is still growing by 2.5 percent annually at that point, according to CBO. It's just wouldn't grow as fast because of the big debt. Sanford is quoting the number out of context and neglecting to point out that it is a reduction from the baseline, which itself was going up. So he gives the impression it is a decline in the real GDP, when it's really a decline in GDP growth. Big difference. To say Sanford is cherry-picking the letter would be too generous. He has taken one number from a letter that seems to support his thesis and distorted it. And he's ignored several more prominent measurements that show the stimulus bill would help the economy. So we find his claim to be False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Heads up: Another Bush is raising his profile.As noted in a March 3, 2012, Texas Tribune news article, attorney George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, has been pitching afresh for a group he helped found, the Hispanic Republicans of Texas.\"Politics is in my blood,\" the Tribune story quotes Bush as saying in a story about the group's political action committee.But Rebecca Acuña, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, sounded skeptical of the PAC’s chances of helping Republican Hispanics advance. Acuña told the Tribune: \"They are delusional if they think they’re making any inroads with Latinos. In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party.\"Do Hispanic Democratic elected officials so greatly outnumber their Latino Republican counterparts in Texas?Looked entirely like it -- at first.To our inquiry, Acuña sent us portions of a 2011 directory of Latino elected officials compiled by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which describes itself as the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials.The chart provided by Acuña says that of 2,520 Hispanic elected officials in Texas in January 2011, 668 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans, matching the figures aired to the Tribune. Two school board members were counted as Independents.According to the chart, 496 elected Latino officials in Texas held nonpartisan offices, mainly serving in municipal government or on school boards, and another 1,294 Latino elected officials, also mostly serving on school boards or in municipal offices, were listed as \"no party stated.\"And how does NALEO gather all this?A methodology section of the 2011 directory says the NALEO Educational Fund has regularly attempted to tabulate Latino elected officials since 1984. For the 2011 check, NALEO staff contacted each identified official by phone or fax to ask whether they were indeed Latino, the group says.\"The phone verification process proved invaluable,\" the methodology section says. \"Many individuals having Spanish surnames were in fact, not Latino. Conversely, other individuals with non-Spanish surnames were identified as being Latino.\"Rosalind Gold, a senior director for the NALEO Educational Fund, told us in a telephone interview that how officeholders self-identify has proved pivotal. \"We very much rely on self-identification in determining who is and who is not Latino,\" Gold said.By email, Martha Recio, a NALEO research assistant, confirmed the figures cited for 2011.At our request, NALEO also composed a chart showing its identified party breakdowns for Texas Latino elected officials for 2001 through 2011.The group’s determinations of party affiliations have been incomplete because, Gold told us, so many local offices are filled in non-partisan elections; such candidates do not run as party nominees. In each of the years, at least 68 percent of the Latino elected officials tabulated by NALEO were not identified by party affiliation.Also, Gold said, if the group could not verify an officeholder’s party membership by telephoning their office, it did not attempt to do so by tapping other sources. NALEO doesn’t have resources to do that, she said. Sometimes, too, Gold said, an officeholder declined to discuss his or her party membership.We asked Gold if it’s fair to make comparisons limited to its counts of Republican and Democratic Latino elected officials when most of the group’s identified Latino elected officials are not identified by party. Gold replied that this is the kind of context NALEO provides when discussing its counts. \"We say that of the elected officials we were able to verify affiliation for, here is the party breakdown,\" she said.Back to the Texas counts: Among officeholders tabulated as Democrats or Republicans, the share of Democratic elected officeholders dropped from 32 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2010 before reaching nearly 27 percent in 2011. The relative share of Latino Republican officeholders was .7 percent in 2001, escalating to .9 percent in 2010 and 2.4 percent in 2011, according to the group.With so many party affiliations not nailed down, we wouldn’t blame anyone for ruling out comparisons of results for different years. That misgiving aside, though, it looks like the ratio of elected Hispanic Democrats to Republican Latinos in Texas has narrowed. The NALEO counts suggest there were nearly 45 Hispanic Texas Democrats per Republican counterpart in 2001, 34 in 2005 and 11 in 2011.Our rulingThe Texas Democratic Party’s spokeswoman correctly cited two figures from the 2011 NALEO directory suggesting that Latino elected Democrats in Texas greatly outnumber their Republican counterparts.Still, this claim is missing substantive context -- that NALEO did not determine the party memberships of most Latino Texas officeholders. If this were done, the Democratic-Republican ratio might change.We rate the claim Mostly True.\n",

The claim is false; age of consent laws do not fall under presidential jurisdiction, and the screenshot of the article is doctored from an unrelated CNN story. Biden administration lowered age of consent to 8\n",
            "[Evidences]:“Biden administration lowers age of consent to 8,” claims the headline in the post, versions of which have been shared in the United States and Australia since the end of January 2021. Doctored CNN article The posts associates the headline with a CNN article written by Jennifer Hansler, Michael Conte and Devan Cole. The article below wrongly claims that President Biden said “we have to do it... the age, the kids, they should be about this old”.“CNN did not report any such story. The image is fake and quite frankly, appalling,” Matt Dornic, CNN’s head of strategic communications, told AFP by email. Jennifer Hansler and Michael Conte independently confirmed to AFP that the image was doctored. Hansler added that this article about Biden’s pick for United Nations ambassador was the original. It matches the January 27, 2021 time and date of the doctored image. A search of the CNN website showed no articles stating that the Biden administration tried to change the age of consent. Age of consent laws Similarly, a search of the White House press website also did not reveal any action aimed at changing the minimum age. “It’s impossible for any President to reset the age of consent across the nation for all adult activities. Practically speaking, only the state legislatures and Congress can make binding law to effectuate such a change in the age of consent,” Jennifer Drobac, a law professor at Indiana University, said by email. “Most age of consent laws (for marriage, consensual sexual activity, and other adult behaviors) are made on the state level by state legislatures,” Drobac added. This was confirmed by Janet Halley, a professor at Harvard Law School who said by email: “President Biden can’t change those – he has no authority over the state provisions and Congress has to legislate to change any age of consent provisions in federal statutory law. I am unaware of any effort he may be making in this area.” AFP contacted the White House for comment and received no response. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the lowest age of consent for sexual intercouse set by the states is 16. AFP has debunked similar misinformation, linked to QAnon conspiracy theory groups, surrounding age of consent laws. False claims that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted to lower the age of consent to 12 were shared in the United States and reforms aimed at ending age discrimination against the LGBT community were falsley linked to pedophilia in Canada and California.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared \"wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:If Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, she knows every bit of her life will be put under a microscope. Republican strategist and Fox News commentator Karl Rove proved the point at an event near Los Angeles last Thursday. In remarks reported in the New York Post, Rove raised questions about Clinton’s health following a mild concussion in 2012. \"Thirty days in the hospital,\" Rove said. \"And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that.\" Many people took Rove’s comments to mean that he thinks Clinton has a brain injury, though Rove says he was just raising the question and that it should be part of any presidential vetting. There are two points for us to cover in this fact check -- the time Clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward. (She doesn’t wear them now.) First, the background. In December 2012, a stomach virus kept Clinton at home where she fainted and hit her head. During a follow-up visit, doctors spotted a blood clot, admitted her to the hospital and treated her with blood thinners. Clinton was in the hospital for about four days, not 30, a point Rove got wrong. (In a subsequent interview, Rove said it was a \"30-day period where she’s fighting something.\") Clinton testified near the end of January at a House hearing on the Benghazi, Libya, attack, and was seen wearing the glasses Rove referred to. A State Department spokesman said they were related to issues stemming from her concussion. The peculiar shape of one of the lenses led experts and doctors to conclude they were prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision, experts told us. We spoke with Steven Galetta, who is chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center. \"About 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem,\" Galetta said. \"When there’s double vision, we can manage it by putting a prism over one eye. It bends the light to line up the image from the other eye.\" Galetta said the glasses are often optional. Whether someone wears them depends on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. \"Most patients resolve (the issues) on their own,\" he said. \"I’d say 85 to 90 percent of these patients do incredibly well and have no recognizable symptoms afterwards.\" Given Clinton’s job as Secretary of State, Galetta said he could see why her doctors might have jumped in to deal with her complaint. Rove exagerated the tie between the glasses and trauma. Galetta said such lenses are used in cases other than traumatic brain injury. Anything that affects the ocular motor nerves or the way the eyes worktogether can produce double vision that then might be treated with prismatic glasses. So while Rove said the glasses are used \"only\" for people with traumatic brain injury, doctors say that is incorrect. More broadly, Rove’s characterization of Clinton’s concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated a bit of concern among the physicians we reached. Doug Smith is a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith said the public might not understand how broadly the term applies. The Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010. \"Technically, a concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury,\" Smith said. \"But Rove made a linkage that doesn’t fit. Having a concussion and wearing those glasses tell you nothing about a person’s cognitive status. The vast majority of people with concussions make a full recovery.\" Our ruling Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital and then emerged wearing glasses that only people with traumatic brain injury use. Rove since said he was wrong about the length of her hospital stay. The actual number is four days. By describing a long hospital stay and tying it to signs of traumatic brain injury, Rove associated Clinton with a more profound medical episode. Experts reject that association. Concussions are the mildest form of traumatic brain injury. The glasses Clinton wore are an optional treatment for temporary problems of double vision that are relatively common among people who suffer concussions along with other conditions. She has not worn the glasses for some time, and the neurologists we contacted said most people recover fully. While Rove never claimed Clinton suffered brain damage, he was wrong about the hospital stay and combined that with the glasses to exaggerate the nature of Clinton’s injury. His claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.\n",

The incident took place at a two-wheeler agency in Rajasthan’s Nagaur district. Two Dalit youths were assaulted on a two-wheeler service station. Two young Dalit cousins were brutally assaulted by the staff at a two-wheeler showroom in Rajasthan’s Nagaur. In a video, men can be seen stripping the brothers, beating them and inserting a screwdriver dipped in petrol into one of their anus.https://t.co/wk2aOlJTbO — The Wire (@thewire_in) February 20, 2020 Hanuman Singh, owner of the two-wheeler agency, and others assaulted the youths for allegedly stealing cash from the counter. The Indian Express reported that one of the victims was allegedly assaulted on private parts with a screwdriver dipped in petrol. As per Scroll, Rajasthan police arrested seven men and detained another seven in February 2020. Panchodi police station SHO Rajpal Singh told the media that initially both sides had “reached a compromise”. The FIR was registered only after the videos went viral. Consequently, two FIRs were filed. The first one was against the attackers, filed under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections: 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 143 (unlawful assembly), along with three other sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The other was a counter FIR filed by Singh, one of the seven arrested, against the two Dalit youths under IPC section 380 (theft). In the FIR, Singh alleged that the duo stole Rs 50,000 from the showroom counter. A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, told The Print that Nagaur has seen several instances of caste-based violence in the past. “Caste-based violence happens here routinely. Jats and Rajputs are proud of their castes and socially powerful. In areas where there is awareness, there is peace. But that isn’t the case in most places of Nagaur,” he said. It must be noted that the incident took place in Nagaur district while social media claims suggest it happened in Govindgarh which is Jaipur district. To conclude, a video of a violent and sickening assault on two men from the Dalit community in 2020 was recently shared with misleading context. The culprits involved in the incident were arrested by Rajasthan police in February 2020. Donate to Alt News!

            "[Evidences]:Under public pressure to rein in corruption, Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta promised an \"all-out assault\" as he delivered his sixth state of the nation address in April 2019.But as he listed the achievements of his administration in parliament, was he on target with his facts? We checked.The economyClaim “Our broad-based economic growth averaged 5.6% over the last five years...” Verdict correctIn 2013, the year the president took office, the Kenyan economy grew 5.9%, and 5.4% in 2014, according to data from the national statistics office.Theeconomic survey 2018shows economic growth was 5.7% in 2015, 5.9% in 2016 and 4.9% in 2017.The average over those five years works out to 5.56%. We therefore rate the president’s figure as correct. -Alphonce ShiunduClaim ”... outperforming the average global growth.” Verdict misleadingKenyatta said the rate the Kenyan economy grew at had outpaced the world.According to the International Monetary Fund’sWorld Economic Outlookupdate in January 2019, the world economy grew 3.7% in 2018, a slight dip from 3.8% in 2017.Additionaldatashows global growth was 3.2% in both2015and 2016, and3.4%in 2014. In 2013 thiswas 3.2%. This averages to 3.36% between 2013 and 2017, which is well under Kenya’s growth that same period. The figures appear to bear the president out.But there’s more. Is Kenya doing better than the rest of the world? We asked Kwame Owino, thechief executiveof think tank theInstitute of Economic Affairs, Kenyafor context.'Compare ourselves with our peers'The numbers are expected, Kwame said. This is because mature economies grow at a slower rate, having exhausted the capital and gains they can get from technology. But the US with 2% growth still created significantly more wealth than Kenya did with a 5.6% growth rate.Kenya therefore needed to grow even faster to close the public welfare gap, Kwame said. But the broader comparison distorts the picture.“It is misleading. We should compare our growth rates with our peers, people within our range,” Kwame said.For instance, according to World Bankdata, in eastern Africa, over the last five years, Kenya’s economy has been growing faster than Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, but slower compared to Tanzania and Ethiopia.Claim “In 2018, provisional estimates show the economy grew by 6.1%.” Verdict mostly-correctKenya’sstatistics agencyexpects the economyto grow 6%in 2018. This is according to the national treasury’sbudget policy statement.The economy grew 5.8% in the first three months of 2018, 6.2% in the second quarter and 6% in the third quarter of the year. This, theKenya National Bureau of Statisticssaid, was due to “favourable weather conditions and a stable macroeconomic environment”.TheParliamentary Budget Office– a non-partisan office that advises lawmakers on the economy -mirrored thisforecast in March 2019.In a forecast the same month, theWorld Bankpredicted5.8% growthfor the year. This would be due to “recovery in agriculture, better business sentiment, and easing of political uncertainty”.For the economy to grow at 6.1%, growth for the last quarter will need to come in at 6.4%. But given the proximity of the other forecasts to the president’s figure, which he noted was provisional, we rate this claim as mostly correct.- Alphonce ShiunduPowerClaim ”We have made tremendous gains… over the last six years, with the number of electricity connections rising from 2.2 million in March 2013 to 7.1 million as at March 2019.” Verdict mostly-correctThetextof the president’s speech gave the number of connections as 2.264 million in March 2013 and 7.029 million in March 2019. But when he spoke he said “2.2 million” and “7.1 million”.National utilityKenya Power’s 2018annual reportsays it had an estimated 6.76 million customers connected to electricity. An earlier report says there were2.33 millioncustomers at the end of June 2013.Kevin Sang, a spokesperson for Kenya power, told Africa Check the latest figures were 7 million customers connected to power.What the president actually said is therefore mostly correct-Alphonce Shiundu.Claim “Installed capacity has increased from 1,768 MW in March 2013 to the current 2,712 MW.” Verdict correctKenyatta said clean energy plants had helped increase capacity, with wind projects in Lake Turkana and Ngong and a solar project in Garissa joining the grid in 2018.Theenergy regulatory commissionputs Kenya’sinstalled capacityin June 2013 at 1,765 MW. By June 2018 it had risen to 2,351 MW, according todatafromKenya Power.(Note:Installed capacityis the capacityof all the power plants if they run at 100%. Effective capacity is the actual available power.)“According to our latest figures, the installed capacity is now 2,712 MW, while the effective capacity is 2,638 MW,” Kenya Power spokesperson Kevin Sang told Africa Check on 5 April 2019, the day after Kenyatta’s State of the Nation Address.We therefore rate the claim as correct.-Alphonce ShiunduCounty fundingClaim ”Since April 2013, more than KSh1.7 trillion shillings has been transferred to the counties.” Verdict incorrectIn 2010,a new constitutionprovided for the creation of 47 county governments. The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of “not less than 15%” of all revenue collected by the national government.The Division of Revenue Acts show the total allocations to county governments were KSh 1.76 trillion. However, not all this money was actually transferred.The sums actually sent to the countiesare capturedby theoffice of the controller of budget.The treasury releases money to the county governments' accounts, but the controller of budget then finalises the transfer by allowing the counties to access the money.Amounts to Kenya counties 2013-2019 (billions of shillings) Year Total Allocation Treasury transfers to counties Approved by budget office 2013/2014 210 195.7 174.4 2014/2015 242.36 231.06 228.53 2015/2016 287.04 276.22 303.47 2016/2017 302.2 305.02 328.24 2017/2018 345.69 326.9 324.12 2018/2019* 372.74 177.31* 145.11** TOTAL 1760.03 1512.22 1503.87The amount transferred to the counties as per the latest available figure is KSh1,503.87. The president’s amount is thus off by KSh190 billion. We therefore rate the claimincorrect. -Vincent Ng'etheREAD MORE: How Kenyatta mangled his numbers on Kenyan counties’ development spendEducationClaim ”Our aggressive push of this [universal access to basic education] agenda has this year seen us achieve 100% transition rate.” Verdict incorrectTransportClaim “2.5 million passengers have travelled using Madaraka Express since its inception in May 2018.” Verdict correctIn 2017, some 699,055 passengers travelled on the train, according to December 2018economic datafrom thenational statistics agency.They brought in receipts of KSh627 million.In 2018, revised official data showed that the train carried 1,665,627 passengers, bringing in KSh1.6 billion in revenue. This, Rosemary Bowen, an official with the statistics agency, told Africa Check.The first two months of 2019 recorded 226,027 passengers. Since its launch in May 2018 the train has carried 2,590,709 passengers and earned revenue of KSh2.5 billion.This number of passengers also counts repeat passengers, Bowen said. “It is not unique passengers.” In November 2018, a passenger recognised as thetwo millionthpassenger said she was a frequent user of the service.- Vincent Ng’etheClaim ”Since its inception 3.881 million tonnes of cargo have been transported on the standard-gauge railway line.” Verdict mostly-correctData from the national bureau of statistics showed that 5 million tonnes of cargo had been moved by December 2018 - about 1.1 million tonnes of cargo more than the President stated.We asked about the discrepancy. The agency said the data had been revised. Transportation of cargo did not startuntil January 2018. That year, the cargo service moved 2.9 million tonnes, earning revenue of KSh4.1 billion. In the first two months of 2019 some 662,419 tonnes of cargo were transported.This brought the total to 3.6 million tonnes. With March 2019 not accounted for, we rate the president’s number of 3.8 million tonnes as mostly correct.- Vincent Ng’etheHousingClaim ”Over 175,000 Kenyans have already registered under the voluntary scheme known as ‘boma yangu.” Verdict mostly-correctProviding affordable housing is a key priority for Kenyatta’s legacy. As part of this, the president noted that more than 175,000 Kenyans have registered for a plan to allocate houses.Citizens are first requireda. This thenallows them and their employers to contribute some of their income, up to a maximum of KSh2,500 a month. There’s also a voluntary contribution that is not capped.When the building of houses starts, the applicantswillthrough a “regular, fair and transparent system free of any human intervention and contact” be allocated houses. This will depend on a number of factors such as when they listed, “family status as well as demand across the housing categories”.As of 4 April 2019 there were186,256registered applicants. While this is 11,000 more people, it is “over 175,000”. The president actually missed the chance to announce a larger figure. - Alphonce ShiunduREAD MORE:500,000 or 200,000?

Some 42.2% of the businesses were licensed while 57.8% were unlicensed.The president’s claim is correct based on the most recently available public data. -Vincent Ng’etheFurther reading\n",

            "claim [Claim]: The military has spent $500 million enforcing the \"Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell\" policy regarding gays and lesbians in the military.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Gays and lesbians will soon be allowed to serve openly in the United States military and a bill by Republican Del. Bob Marshall to ban them from the Virginia National Guard has been squashed in committee.But that didn’t silence Del. Joe Morrissey, D-Henrico, who tried to counter Marshall by introducing legislation that would have barred the state from banning gays. His bill was killed by the same panel that snuffed Marshall’s.Morrissey, still wanting to speak on the subject, rose on the House floor on Feb. 2 and said the military spent \"half a billion dollars to drum [gays] out of the service.\"Is he right?Morrissey told us he based his statement on a reportfrom The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The organization studies laws and public policies regarding sexual orientation.A May, 2010 report from the group projected costs between $290.7 million and $555.2 million from 1994 and 2008. The research relied on information from the Government Accountability Office and the Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Palm Center studies gender and sexuality in the military.We found two Government Accountability Office reports on the \"Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell\" policy. The first, released in 2005, examined the costs of the policy over its first decade, from 1994 through 2003. It said 9,488 soldiers and sailors were kicked out of the military under the policy during those years. The study said the dismissals cost the government about $95 million, using 2004 values, to recruit replacements. The GAO said it was unable to obtain the cost of replacing Marines and 136 ousted officers. Administrative costs were not calculated as well.In the GAO’s most recent report, released last month, the government watchdog reviewed dismissals from 2004 through 2009. That report found 3,664 expulsions and estimated the replacement cost at $193.3 million, in 2009 dollars.The GAO said this study contained more detailed information than the previous report, including data on administrative expenses and the price of replacing officers, who are far more expensive to train because the military often pays for their education at a service academy or through the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.But Zina Merritt, who spearheaded the GAO’s latest report, said these two studies don’t necessarily allow us to determine a total cost of dismissals over the entire life of the \"Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell\" program.\"In fact, we somewhat discourage doing that because there were a number of different factors on data we got this round that we didn’t get the last round,\" she said. \"In 2005 the data didn’t include the Marine Corps, medical personnel and some other costs.\"Merritt said it would be better to view the reports as a base-line estimate of costs associated with the program. She acknowledged the true expenses were likely higher, given the GAO’s inability to gather all of the data it sought.The Palm Center tried to establish a more comprehensive cost figure with its 2006 report, which was authored by a commission that included former Defense Department officials, including William Perry, the Secretary of Defense from 1994 until 1997. Also serving on the panel were faculty members from the U.S. Military Academy and the Naval Postgraduate School.The commission said the GAO’s 2005 report accounted for the cost of replacing soldiers but did not adjust for any value received by the military over the course of a discharged soldier’s service. The Palm Center study said the military underestimated the price of training soldiers. It noted that while a 1998 report said the average cost of training an enlistee is $28,800, the 2005 paper found that the Navy, which had the highest per-capita training cost, said it spent just $18,000 training a new enlistee. The Army and Air Force said they spent even less.After speaking with an Army research analyst, the Palm Center group reported the average cost of training an Army recruit was between $45,600 to $56,400. Given that information, the Palm Center said it believes the GAO report underestimated training costs.The commission also sought to calculate the costs of training officers. If found some officers,such as jet pilots, can cost more than $1 million to train, though most are not as expensive.The commission considered several other costs, such as money spent by the military on travel costs for discharged soldiers. The group ultimately estimated a $363.8 million price for the policy’s enforcement between 1994 and 2003. When the Williams Center’s estimate for next five years is included, the total cost is reported at $555.2 million for 1994 through 2008.Let’s review.Morrissey said the military has spent \"half a billion dollars\" to dismiss gays and lesbians from the military.If we combine the GAO costs from its two reports, we get a total of $288.3 million spent enforcing \"Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.\" And as the author of the most-recent report told us, that should be considered a minimum estimate, not an accurate total cost.The Williams Institute at UCLA and the Palm Center at UCSB both believe the actual costs were higher. Williams put its most recent estimate at $555.2 million. Neither Williams nor the Palm Center had complete access to military records on recruitment and spending.Morrissey’s figures are certainly reasonable. But because of the difference between the GAO figures and the figures from other groups, we rate his claim at Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Republican leaders said \"no\" to \"tax cuts for 95% of working Americans.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In its latest installment of cable ads suggesting that Rush Limbaugh is the de facto leader of the Republican Party, the liberal Americans United for Change takes Republican leaders to task for failing to support the Democrats' economic stimulus package. In particular, we were intrigued by the counterintuitive suggestion that several prominent Republicans are against tax cuts for working families. \"Republican leaders,\" the announcer begins. \"Their policies created the worst economic crisis in a generation. \"But what did they say to President Obama’s recovery plan?\" A series of \"no's\" follow from Republican leaders, set to Jacques Offenbach's can-can from \"Orpheus in the Underworld\" (you'll know it when you hear it, and yes, we had to look that up). The four leaders: Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate; John Boehner, the leader of Republicans in the House; Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip; and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. \"…To tax cuts for 95% of working Americans?\" This time, the chorus of \"no's\" come courtesy of Sen. Jim DeMint; Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee; and McConnell. We're not even sure what Palin and Steele are doing here. Palin and Steele do not serve in the U.S. Congress. They could not vote on the stimulus plan. So their stated opposition to the bill amounted to nothing more than opinion. And the opinions they offered did not speak directly to the proposed tax cuts. More important, though, is the suggestion that these Republicans oppose tax cuts for working Americans. The stimulus package signed by Obama includes a tax credit for workers intended to offset payroll taxes. Single workers would get $400 and working couples would get $800. We have looked at this proposal in the past and confirmed that it would result in tax cuts for 95 percent of working families. And yes, most Republicans voted against that economic stimulus package. But Republican opposition to the bill overwhelmingly focused on the spending portion of the plan. Here's what Palin said about the stimulus plan in a news release: \"The governor recognizes that some form of economic stimulus is necessary, but not the bill that passed the Congress Friday. She has advocated for a package that includes federal spending for infrastructure, tax breaks for individuals and small businesses, and measures to address the housing situation. The governor believes the current legislation is too large and is not sufficiently focused on these objectives.\" We note that Palin specifically states her support for a plan that includes \"tax breaks for individuals.\" So what about the two Republicans in the ad who did vote against the bill? DeMint offered an alternative to the Democrats' stimulus plan called \"The American Option.\" In a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation on Jan. 29, 2009, DeMint lambasted the Democrats' stimulus spending as wasteful and reckless. His plan, developed by J.D. Foster and William Beach of the Heritage Foundation, would make permanent the temporary tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 — now set to expire in 2011. DeMint also proposed to cut tax rates nearly across the board. According to Foster, DeMint's plan eliminated any tax relief to those who pay no income tax; Foster and DeMint have likened that to welfare. The only ones who wouldn't get a tax cut under that plan are people paying less than 10 percent now, Foster said. The DeMint plan also called for permanent repeal of the alternative minimum tax; permanently extending the $1,000 per child tax credit; and repeal of the \"marriage tax\" penalty. Sounds to us like a tax break for working Americans. Asked about the Americans United for Change ad, a spokeswoman in McConnell's office noted that McConnell (and DeMint) voted in favor of an amendment to the stimulus package offered by Sen. John McCain that they say would have provided tax relief to all income tax payers. The McCain amendment, which failed by a party-line vote of 40 to 57, called for approximately $275 billion in tax cuts. McCain said it \"would eliminate the 3.1 percent payroll tax for all employees for one year and use general revenues to pay for the Social Security obligation. It would allocate $60 billion to lower the 10 percent tax bracket to 5 percent for one year. It would lower the 15 percent tax bracket to 10 percent for one year.\" In other words, the Republican plans included tax breaks for workers too. Just not the variety proposed by the Obama administration. So yes, DeMint and McConnell voted against the Democratic stimulus plan. But they said they did so mostly because of objections to the spending portion of the plan. And they offered alternatives that included tax cuts for working families. To be sure, there are big differences in the distribution of tax cuts proposed by the two sides. But to say Republicans opposed tax cuts for working families based on opposition to the stimulus package grossly distorts the Republican position. We rate the ad's claim Barely True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:An article shared widely on Facebook wrongly claims that Sen. Kamala Harris was \"caught in a major lie\" over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s position on fracking. The Oct. 7 article from the Western Journal, a conservative news and political commentary website, says Harris’ comments during the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate flew in the face of \"a history of promises\" she and Biden had made to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article juxtaposes Harris’s comment during the vice presidential debate with a much different comment the California senator made more than a year earlier. Other Facebook posts that drew similar traffic have paired video footage of the two comments back to back. \"Joe Biden will not end fracking,\" Harris said during the debate, in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s false claim to the contrary. \"He has been very clear about that.\" \"There’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking,\" Harris said some 13 months earlier, in response to an activist’s question during a Sept. 4, 2019, town hall hosted by CNN. Taken side by side, the two quotes show two different positions. But that doesn’t mean she was lying during the vice presidential debate. There’s a key detail that explains her shift: Harris is now Biden’s running mate, meaning she is tied to his platform. When she made the initial comment in 2019, she was a primary presidential candidate running against Biden and vying for the party’s nomination with her own positions. Biden’s official campaign platform does not call for a ban on fracking, although the former vice president’s past comments from the campaign trail have led to some confusion on his stance. During a March debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, Biden said he supported \"no new fracking\" — a comment his campaign later clarified, saying he was only referring to his stated policy calling for a ban on new permits for oil and gas drilling on federally owned lands. George Upper, the Western Journal’s editor in chief, pointed in an email to other comments Biden has made that appeared to reflect an anti-fracking stance, such as a moment where he told an activist in September 2019, \"I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel.\" \"Harris is on the record with multiple similar statements,\" Upper said. But Biden’s plan isn’t as simple as he’s sometimes made it seem. After he said during a July 2019 debate that he would \"work (fossil fuels) out,\" his campaign clarified that he supports eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and a gradual shift toward clean energy with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Both proposals are listed on his campaign website. According to Biden’s campaign website, he supports \"banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters.\" PolitiFact has fact-checked several statements — including false claims from President Donald Trump and his reelection campaign — about Biden and fracking. Biden says that he won’t shut down existing fracking operations on public land, and that he’ll allow fracking to continue on private lands, where most of it takes place. Regardless, Harris was speaking for her own candidacy in 2019 when she said she was in favor of banning fracking. She wasn’t \"caught in a major lie\" during the vice presidential debate.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The footage is from a video game and does not depict actual events. The video was posted by a Facebook user who identifies himself as a gaming video creator. The \"about\" section of his Facebook page says his videos are for entertainment purposes and are made using flight simulators. We did not locate any news reports indicating that an Air Force One pilot had been fired. Comments on the video indicate that many people knew it was not really Air Force One, some questioned whether it was real, and at least one Facebook user appeared to think it was true. \"No. Commander in chief arm forces. He shouldn't have to lose his job because of that, maybe those are the kinds of pilots that we need in the air, ready at all times,\" one comment said. The 10-minute video begins with the aircraft pulling back from the terminal, where other planes are parked. But Air Force One never parks at a terminal, because it has to be able to take off quickly if needed, according to reports. Around the 6-minute mark in the video, the simulated plane takes off vertically, as the headline says. The plane depicted in the video also does not match the real Air Force One aircraft. For example, the simulated plane shows two vertical stabilizers, each emblazoned with an American flag, while the real Air Force One has a single vertical stabilizer with one American flag.

            "[Evidences]:When president Uhuru Kenyatta delivered his state of the nation address on 30 November 2021, he didn't correct some inaccuracies Africa Check identified in his Mashujaa Day speech a month before. Any Kenyan president is required to give a proper assessment of the state of the country each year. In this extensive report, we examine 15 claims in the address. We have again asked the president's office for the source of the data. On 30 November Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta addressed a joint sitting of parliament on the state of the nation, as required by law . In his speech Kenyatta focused on the post-pandemic economy. He also claimed achievements in building roads, schools, electrification, healthcare and more. Did he get all his facts right? We took a closer look at 15 key claims he made, some recycled from his Mashujaa – Heroes' – Day speech on 20 October, despite Africa Check having found them to be incorrect or misleading . We have asked the president's office for the sources of the data used in the speech and will update this report when we hear back. \"While most economies in the world shrank, Kenya's economy grew at 0.3%,\" Kenyatta said . He called this \"positive\" – if \"minimal\" – growth. It's a claim he also made on Mashujaa Day. Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics d irected us to the most recent economic survey for reliable data on growth. It was published in September 2021. The survey says Kenya's economy shrank by 0.3% in 2020 . World Bank data shows the same 0.3% contraction . And in a speech launching the survey, Kenyatta's finance minister Ukur Yatani also said the economy was \"estimated to have contracted by 0.3% in 2020\". Yatani attributed this to lockdown-related restrictions and a reduced demand for goods and services. – Makinia Juma The national statistics office has the data to check this claim, John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership thinktank told Africa Check. The data agency publishes quarterly gross domestic product reports, most recently in October 2021. This shows that Kenya's GDP at market prices grew by 10.1% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2020. Uhuru Kenyatta delivers 2021 state of the nation address. CITIZEN TV SCREENGRAB The 10.1% is not \" real GDP \", as the president claimed. It's nominal GDP at market prices, unadjusted for inflation. Not taking inflation into account tends to distort the value of an economy. \"The problem with the president's statement is that we are missing the context,\" Kinuthia said. \"The 'phenomenal growth' was because we are comparing it to a period when the economy was locked down.\" In the second quarter of 2020, Kenya's economy shrank by -5.7%. This was mainly due to restrictive measures aimed at countering Covid-19. Because of their unprecedented nature, a sharp recovery would be expected when these measures were eased, as noted by the statistics office. Prof Charles Wheelan is a senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the US and author of Naked Statistics , among other works. \"This is not a sign of robust new economic growth. It is a sign of recovery,\" he told Africa Check. \"It's not like getting a big raise at work. It's more like being unemployed for a spell and then getting your old job back. It's good – clearly better than the alternative – but not a huge sign of progress.\" The president was right that the economy grew by a higher than normal pace of 10.1% in the second quarter, but he left out important context. We therefore rate his claim as misleading. (Find out more about how we rate claims .) – Alphonce Shiundu Data from the statistics bureau shows that the 10.1% growth in the second quarter of 2020 was the highest of any quarter in two decades – since 2000. We asked the bureau's director-general Macdonald Obudho if there was earlier data. He said there wasn't. \"We do not have any data before that time. We were not generating quarterly GDP data before,\" Obudho said. Kenya gained independence in 1963 , almost six decades ago. But the available quarterly GDP data only goes back to 2000. We can therefore only rate the claim as unproven. – Alphonce Shiundu For historical data, the International Budget Partnership 's Kinuthia directed us to the world development indicators , a World Bank database covering 217 economies – 189 member countries and 28 \"other\" economies. The data shows that Kenya's economy grew by 22% in 1971 and 17% in 1972. The 10.1% rise in the second quarter of 2020 is therefore not \"the first time\" the country has had double-digit economic growth. And Dartmouth College's Wheelan explained that \"double digit growth\" usually means \"GDP growth (stripped of inflation) of 10% a year\". He added: \"The government can credibly say that the economy appears to be undergoing a robust recovery. It's a stretch for them to say they are delivering double-digit rates of growth as that phrase typically is used in a context that suggests policies or developments that are permanently raising the productive capacity of a country, not merely bouncing back after a shock.\" We rate the claim as incorrect. – Alphonce Shiundu In his delivered speech , Kenyatta said the rise was from 180 to 651 beds. But the text version gives it as from 108 beds. Before the pandemic, he said , there was only an average of two ICU beds in each of Kenya's 47 counties. We checked this exact claim in the president's Mashujaa Day speech and found it to be unproven. Read our detailed findings as to why his numbers still do not add up. – Makinia Juma Kenya's statistics bureau gives figures on the country's power situation in its yearly economic surveys. The figures come from the electricity utility Kenya Power and the power-generating company KenGen . The 2014 economic survey says the country had 1,717.8 megawatts of total installed capacity in 2013, not 1,300 MW. Similarly, Kenya Power data shows that on 30 June 2013, two months after Kenyatta was sworn in, installed capacity was at 1,765 MW . The president understated the electricity available in 2013 by more than 400 MW. The grid capacity was closest to the president's claim in 2009, when it was at 1,311 MW . This was four years before he took office. – Alphonce Shiundu In 2020, the country's installed capacity was 2,836.7 MW, according to the statistics bureau's most recent economic survey , released in September 2021. Available electricity has increased by 1,118.9 MW since 2013. This is a 65% rise, close to two thirds. Capacity has not doubled. We also checked Kenya Power's most recent report . This showed that on 30 June 2021, Kenya had 2,984 MW in its grid. The increase from June 2013 to June 2021 is 1,219 MW or 69%. There's no evidence that installed capacity has doubled since 2013. – Alphonce Shiundu The increase from 2013 to 2021, according to Kenya Power's most recent data is 1266.2 MW, an average increase of 158.3 MW a year. For Kenyatta's administration to have installed 325 MW every year for eight years, the total increase would have had to be 2,600 MW. We rate the claim as incorrect. – Alphonce Shiundu Kenya Power says it supplies electricity to \"individual households, private industries, companies and government institutions\". Its 2013 report shows there were a total of 2,330,962 customers connected to electricity. But only 2.1 million were domestic customers, or households. That means about 200,000 were other customers. Kenyatta equates the total customer base to household connections. This gives a misleading picture of households' access to electricity in 2013. – Makinia Juma Has the Kenyatta administration tripled the number of households connected to electricity? We sifted through Kenya Power's annual reports, and found the numbers in the table below. Kenya Power customers 2013-2021 Year Total customers Domestic customers Increase in domestic customers 2012/13 2,330,962 2,059,340 2013/14 2,767,983 2,481,856 422,516 2014/15 3,611,904 3,305,934 824,078 2015/16 4,890,373 4,565,907 1,259,973 2016/17 6,182,282 5,839,865 1,273,958 2017/18 6,761,090 6,404,632 564,767 2018/19 7,067,861 6,682,137 277,505 2019/20 7,576,145 7,156,429 474,292 2020/21 8,278,203 7,852,051 695,622 5,792,711 Source: Kenya Powe r The increase in domestic customers from 2012/13 to 2020/21 adds up to 5.79 million – not 6.3 million. The number of households connected to Kenya Power's grid did almost triple under Kenyatta's administration. But the president overstates the increase by about 500,000. His claim is exaggerated. – Makinia Juma The increase from 2013 to 2021 , according to the most recent data, is 5.79 million – an average of 726,589 a year. This works out to 1,990 connections a day since 2013, when Kenyatta's administration came to power. The claim is mostly correct. – Makinia Juma Kenya's constitution provides for the equitable sharing of money between the national government and the 47 counties. The counties became operational after elections in March 2013. These units of government should receive \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. \"The 15% is the minimum that has to be sent to the counties but, the principle is, the allocations to counties should cover the devolved functions,\" the International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia told us. The Commission on Revenue Allocation assesses the cost of county functions and recommends how funds are shared between national and county government. The recommendations are either adopted or changed by the Division of Revenue Act , if approved by Kenya's parliament . The allocations from 2013 to 2021 are in the table below. ALLOCATIONS TO KENYA COUNTIES 2013-2021 Year Equitable share (KSh billion) (%) of most recent revenues audited and approved by parliament Year of most recent audited revenues 2013/14 190 27.9% 2011/12 2014/15 226.7 43% 2009/10 2015/16 259.8 33% 2012/13 2016/17 280.3 30% 2013/14 2017 / 18 302 32% 2013/14 2018/19 314 33.6% 2013/14 2019/20 316.5 30.5% 2014/15 2020/21 316.5 23.3% 2016/17 Source: Division of Revenue Acts from the National Council for Legal Reporting Going by the equitable shares, the average county allocation over the eight financial years for which allocations have been made works out to 31.6% of the most recent audited revenues. But the \"most recent audited and approved revenues\" are at least three financial years behind, giving a misleading picture – the percentage allocation looks rosy, but the actual amount is low, Kinuthia said. Ideally, the revenues from the previous financial year should be audited and approved by the national assembly in time for the next budget, but this has not happened. The president's numbers may appear correct, but they only give a partial picture. He omits the context of the 15% as a minimum, the role of the CRA in costing the functions before the sharing is done, and the fact that there's at least a three-year lag between the allocations and the most-recent audited and approved revenues. In the end, it paints a misleading picture. – Alphonce Shiundu Kenyatta said the country's taxman – the Kenya Revenue Authority – had collected KSh10.8 trillion since 2013. He added that the amount was \"equivalent to Kenya's GDP\". We checked the authority's data for total revenue collected since 2013. Financial year Revenue collected (trillion Kenyan shillings) 2013/14 0.96 2014/15 1.1 2015/16 1.21 2016/17 1.37 2017/18 1.44 2018/19 1.58 2019/20 1.61 2020/21 1.67 Total tax revenue 2013/14 to 2020/21 10.83 Source: Kenya Revenue Authority . Numbers rounded off. Kenya's GDP was KSh10.8 trillion in 2020/21, according to the statistics bureau. The World Bank's figure is KSh10.5 trillion for 2020. Available data indicates that the Kenya Revenue Authority did collect KSh10.8 trillion in the eight financial years from 2013/14 to 2020/21. The amount is equivalent to the country's GDP in 2020. We rate the claim as correct. – Makinia Juma The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. Kenyatta made the same claim on Mashujaa Day. But when we fact-checked it, we found it to be incorrect. Our report explains why. What data there is shows that while the ratio has improved over the eight years of the president's term, it was at its highest in 2018. There's also no \"prescribed\" United Nations \"standard\" for a policing ratio. Experts have previously told Africa Check that such a recommendation would have little meaning, given countries' significant differences in police functions and capabilities, and the security challenges they face. Instead, the quality of policing is a better indicator. – Makinia Juma Kenyatta said the Kenya Meat Commission , the state-owned meat processor, has an outlet that \"collects KSh1 million\" every day after the military controversially took over its management. The military had turned it around, he said. The KSh1 million a day translated to an average of KSh30 million a month, he said . But is it KSh3.6 billion a year? Here's the maths. Multiplying KSh30 million (one month average) by 12 (months in a year) comes to KSh360 million, not KSh3.6 billion. The president's figure is 10 times off the mark. – Alphonce Shiundu\n",

BOOM found that a Parsi woman delivered 11 babies in Surat is a false claim and the video is unrelated. The false claim comes from a 2011 incident when a Surat based In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) clinic helped 11 women successfully deliver 11 boys on November 11, 2011. The 2 minutes 10 minutes video shows a C-section surgery of a woman inside an operation theatre by doctors and it shows the woman delivers two babies.

The video is viral on Facebook. BOOM also received the video through its WhatsApp helpline for verification. Also Read: Old Photo From UP Falsely Shared As Delhi Police Escorting Hindu Mob Fact Check BOOM ran a Google keyword search with \"Nanpura Hospital in Surat\" but did not find any such hospital. A more relevant keyword search led us to a story published on November 10, 2011 in Times Of India with the headline, \"11 IVF babies to be delivered on 11-11-11 in city\". The TOI report said that a hospital in Gujarat would, \"undertake operations of 11 mothers on 11 November 2011 to commemorate the date 11-11-11. About 30 women had conceived through In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) nine months ago at the 21st century Hospital in the city. Of them, 11 couples wanted the delivery of their babies on the special date. The operations will be performed by Dr Purnima Nadkarni and Dr Pooja Nadkarni and their team of doctors at the hospital from 6 am.\" Taking cue from this, BOOM contacted Dr Pooja Nadkarni Singh who was part of the surgical team who said the video is not related to the same procedure.

            "[Evidences]:U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said at the Iowa State Fair that to face threats from across the globe, ranging from the Middle East to Asia to Russia, the United States needs to keep its military strong. \"The most important obligation of the federal government is to keep you safe and me safe and our family safe,\" Rubio said on Aug. 18, 2015. \"And it’s not doing that now, because we are eviscerating our defense spending.\" One example he cited: \"We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots.\" We were curious if that number was correct, so we decided to check it out. Army announcement Army officials had been talking about reducing the size of their force for several months when they announced specific plans in July 2015. The Army said it will cut the size of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018 -- that’s 40,000 -- with some of the largest cuts at sites in Georgia and Texas. Those cuts will start in October 2015 and end by October 2018. That means the cuts to the Army haven’t happened yet and will be finished under the next president. The cuts are expected to come through attrition, early retirements and layoffs. That’s in addition to plans to cut 17,000 civilians. The Army has been substantially scaling back its force the past few years. In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. In 2013, the Army announced a drawdown of 80,000 to bring the size to the current 490,000. The new cuts will save about $7 billion. Army officials said the cuts are a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the budget sequestration that followed. If sequestration continues, the Army expects to shrink to about 420,000 soldiers sometime in 2019. \"We think 450,000 is the minimum force to meet our obligations across the globe,\" Army spokesman Lt. Cmd. Joe Buccino told PolitiFact. Some lawmakers have questioned the cuts in light of the current situation with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, among other crises. In an op-ed in the Washington Post in May, Rubio was critical of Obama’s actions in Iraq and Syria. He called for the president to\"increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq.\" Rubio correctly cited the number that the Army plans to cut, but he omitted some caveats, including that the cuts haven’t taken place yet. And it’s difficult to predict if the cuts will be fully implemented as the end date in 2018 will be under a new president and Congress. \"The reduction in active Army end-strength is likely but far from certain, given that lots of people in the Congress would like to get the Army more money,\" said Benjamin Friedman, a military expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said she expects the cuts to occur. \"The Army waited as long as possible to even start this latest reduction in force size,\" she said. While the talking about the reduction in soldiers makes good political fodder, it doesn’t address whether higher troop counts are needed, said Charles Knight, co-founder of Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for lower levels of armed force and military spending worldwide. \"The only circumstance in which the Army needs those soldiers is if the U.S. were to reoccupy Iraq, invade and occupy Syria or Iran, or such,\" he said. \"Current government policy is explicitly against such options.\" But the next president -- whether it’s Rubio or someone else -- \"could easily reverse current policy starting in 2017,\" Knight said. A few experts took issue with Rubio’s statement that we are \"eviscerating\" defense spending. \"The term eviscerate is, to my mind, entirely unwarranted for a military that continues to spend almost $600 billion a year, well above the Cold War average and nearly 40 percent of the world’s total,\" said Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Rubio said, \"We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots.\" Rubio was referring to an announcement by the Army in July that it will cut 40,000 spots by fiscal year 2018. Those cuts had been talked about for several months, but the specifics were released in July. The cuts will start this fall but are expected to continue under the next president. Since the end date is under a new president and Congress, it’s difficult to guess if they will all happen, but that’s the plan for now. We rate this claim Mostly True. \n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says President Barack Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Even though the stimulus enacted by President Barack Obama in 2009 has been phased out for a few years now, it remains a talking point for some Republican critics. During his response to Obama’s State of the Union address, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a shot at the stimulus when he said this: \"Mr. President,\" Paul said, \"where are the jobs? You spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs and still joblessness confronts the next generation.\" We wondered whether Paul -- a potential 2016 presidential candidate -- was correct to say that Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs.\" First, some background on the stimulus, which was passed in 2009 with almost exclusive Democratic backing. When it was passed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expected more than 90 percent of the cost to occur within fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. It has found that those expenditures have proceeded more or less on schedule. So far, the stimulus has spent $816 billion. One could characterize that as \"nearly a trillion dollars,\" especially when you add in the debt incurred in order to make that spending possible. The estimate for the debt required to support the stimulus was $347 billion over 10 years, making the combination of the stimulus and the added debt a bit under $1.2 trillion. What’s more problematic about Paul’s claim is his charge that this money went toward \"make-work government jobs.\" This claim is dubious on two levels. First, not all the stimulus money went to paying government employees -- only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did. The stimulus included three broad categories of spending, broken down below with the amount spent so far: • Tax benefits to individuals and businesses: $290.7 billion • Entitlements, including Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benefits: $264.4 billion • Contracts, grants and loans in such areas as education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, science and health: $261.2 billion So right off the bat, more than two-thirds of the total -- tax benefits and entitlement payments -- cannot be fairly categorized as funding \"make-work government jobs.\" These were payments and tax givebacks for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit. The third category, worth $261.2 billion, did include funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors. It’s also worth noting that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statsitics, the size of the federal workforce has declined by 69,000 since Obama took office, though it has risen by about 65,000 if cuts in the Postal Service workforce are not included. That’s about a 3 percent increase over a five-year period if you use the figures that exclude the Postal Service. The drop is even more clear in government jobs at all levels -- federal, state and local. Since Obama took office, government employment has plunged by 734,000 jobs, which is a decrease about 10 times bigger than the federal increase. Which brings us to the second concern: Not all of these government employees were engaged in \"make work.\" Webster’s New World Dictionary defines \"make work\" as \"a job, project or assignment that serves no useful purpose other than to give an otherwise idle or unemployed person something to do.\" The classic example is of paying an unemployed person to dig a hole, then to fill it up again. Whether something qualifies a \"make work\" is open to debate; critics of all ideological stripes can surely find examples of specific projects in the stimulus that they would consider unworthy of taxpayer support. Still, the biggest category of \"contracts, grants and loans\" -- accounting for more than one-third of this heading -- is education, and a big chunk of those funds, about $51 billion, went toward keeping previously employed educators from being laid off. Another $16 billion went to student financial aid, plus a combined $24 billion for educating disadvantaged and special-needs children. Since much of this funding went toward teachers who were already employed, and were in danger of being laid off, it seems hard to characterize their duties as \"make work.\" When we checked with Paul’s office, aides offered a revised phrase to replace \"make-work government jobs\" -- namely, \"government-facilitated job growth.\" This terminology would be more accurate; indeed, we’d expect to find little disagreement with this from Democrats who supported the stimulus. The stimulus was the keystone of Obama’s efforts to stop the nation’s economic freefall, while also accomplishing some other priorities in such areas as infrastructure and scientific research. Democrats tend to believe that government spending -- called \"Keynesian\" after its progenitor, the late economist John Maynard Keynes -- plays a major role in economic downturns in replacing vanished or reduced spending by the private sector. Some Republicans are skeptical of this approach, suggesting that tax cuts get more money into the hands of private individuals who can lead an economic recovery more effectively than the government can. We won’t referee that debate. Instead, we’ll note that we would have agreed there’s a good argument that Obama engaged in roughly $1 billion of \"government-facilitated job growth.\" That, of course, begs the question of whether the payoff in job creation was worth the $1 trillion spent. Employment is up by 3.2 million since Obama was sworn in, but it remains almost 1.2 million below its peak, almost five years into the recovery. Our ruling Paul said Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs.\" It’s plausible that through the stimulus, Obama spent nearly $1 trillion of taxpayer dollars in hopes it would create jobs. But Paul is wrong to suggest that all $1 trillion was spent on \"make-work government jobs.\" Two-thirds of the stimulus was spent on tax cuts and entitlements, and of the remaining one-third, much was paid to private contractors. Only a modest fraction of the $1 trillion was spent on government jobs, much less on jobs spent doing nothing. We rate his claim False.\n",

Now go actually research what you put in your body 🙃.” A screenshot of the post is given below: Fact Check What is formaldehyde? It is a chemical compound that is made up of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. It is a colourless, flammable gas that has a distinct, strong smell. Formaldehyde is naturally produced as a part of cell metabolism in all life forms, including plants, animals, and bacteria. Interestingly, it also naturally occurs in the human body. It is used as a value-added product due to its preservative and antibacterial properties, such as in medicines, paints, household products, fertilizers, etc. Its exposure can irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat and is considered a human carcinogen if exposed for long duration. What is polysorbate 80? Polysorbate 80 is a hydrophilic surfactant (an agent that reduces the surface tension between different compounds) and emulsifier (an additive agent that helps in mixing two liquids). It is most commonly used in pharmaceuticals, foods, and cosmetics. The FDA’s Code of Federal Regulations has approved its use in various food items, such as ice cream, pickles, etc., with certain specifications. Are flu shots contaminated with formaldehyde and polysorbate 80? Not exactly. The CDC lists 9 flu or influenza vaccines on its Vaccine Excipient Table. Out of these nine, five of them contain formaldehyde, four of them contain polysorbate 80 and only three of them have both of these present in them. Also, the word “Contaminated” means to make it less pure or poisonous. However, this is not the case with these additives. These are purposely added in trace amounts. Polysorbate 80 is added to preserve the vaccines and make the manufacture, storage, and transport easier. While formaldehyde is added to inactivate viruses and detoxify the bacterial toxins so that they don’t cause disease, as stated by the FDA. On researching, we found that the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia states that a normal serving of ice cream (1/2 cup) might have about 170,000 micrograms* of polysorbate 80. Whereas the amount of polysorbate 80 is approx. 50 micrograms* (HPV) and 160 micrograms* (COVID-19), in each dose of these vaccines which is very small. This refers that vaccines do not contain polysorbate 80 at quantities that could possibly do any harm. The Oxford Vaccines Group further clarifies this and states that “Compared with its use in foods, there is very little polysorbate 80 in vaccines.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:4 Oct 2020 4:00 AM GMT Hyderabad: On October 2, we celebrated the birth anniversary of India's ex-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Sastri along with that of Mahatma Gandhi. On this occasion, a message is going viral on social media claiming that 'when Lal Bahadur Shastri was Prime Minister of India, he took a loan of Rs 5,000 from PNB bank to buy a Fiat car. But unfortunately, he died after some time. So the bank officials wanted to waive the loan but Shastri's wife refused this offer and she repaid the loan from her pension. Honesty Level for Country' This message is being shared on Facebook and also Twitter profusely. Archive links of the claims are here and here. Fact check: The claim that ex-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri took a loan to buy a car and it was repaid even after his death is TRUE. According to reports, in 1964, he wanted to buy the new Fiat car which costs around Rs 12,000. The family had only Rs 7,000. Being the PM, Shastriji applied for a loan of Rs 5,000, which was sanctioned the same day. But very soon the tragedy of his demise struck the family and the nation. The loan remained unpaid. However, it was repaid by Shastri's widow from the pension she received after his demise. This incident came to light in 2018, when Nirav Modi ran away with crores of loan taken from the Punjab National Bank and was widely published by the media then as Lal Bahadur Shastri also took loan from the same bank. \"We went to St Columbia's School on a tonga. Once in a while, we used the office car but my father did not allow us to use it regularly for any kind of private work. There was a demand at home that we should buy a car,\" Anil Shastri, a senior Congress politician and son of the former PM told the press in an interview in 2018. The car in question, a cream-coloured 1964 model Fiat with the impressive number, DLE 6, is now an essential part of the Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial at 1, Motilal Nehru Marg, in Delhi. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. Even after becoming the Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri took a loan of Rs 5,000 from Punjab National Bank which was paid after his death by his widow from the pension she received.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A border wall with Mexico is happening, but it has to be see-through so that Americans aren’t knocked out by 100 pounds of drugs catapulted across the border, President Donald Trump told supporters. Trump offered the catapult story as an example of the lengths people are going to in order to get drugs into the United States. \"So now they take drugs, literally, and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall, and it lands and it hits somebody on the head. You don't even know they're there,\" Trump said Sept. 22 in Alabama while campaigning for Luther Strange, who was later defeated by Roy Moore for the Republican nomination in the Senate race to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"Believe it or not, this is the kind of stuff that happens. So you need to have a great wall, but it has to be see-through,\" Trump said. Back in July, Trump also spoke of a need for a transparent wall to avoid getting hit by 60-pound sacks of drugs. This fact-check won’t get into whether a see-through wall is the best approach for border security. What we wanted to know is if drugs have been catapulted across the border and hit people on the head. Trump was largely accurate about drugs being catapulted. Immigration officials have seized marijuana launched across the border, and in some cases, found catapults. Whether people have been hit on the head by these sacks is uncertain. Reports from U.S. Customs and Border Protection about catapults date back at least to 2011. An attempt to catapult marijuana into the United States failed in January 2011 after U.S. officials noticed the preparation through remote video surveillance. They contacted Mexican authorities who went over and thwarted the plan. Mexican officials seized a sport utility vehicle, about 45 pounds of marijuana and \"a catapult capable of launching contraband into the U.S.,\" the release said. The attempt happened near Naco, Ariz. In February, Border Patrol agents in Douglas, Ariz. seized two bundles of marijuana catapulted from Mexico, weighing more than 47 pounds combined, CBP said in a news release. Agents on patrol noticed several people retreating from the south side of the border fence as the agents approached, CBP said, and at the fence \"they found a catapult system attached to the south side of the border fence.\" A search of the area led them to the two bundles of marijuana. #USBP agents spring into action dismantling catapult used to launch #Marijuana #HonorfirstDetails: https://t.co/NfhWwej7G7 pic.twitter.com/wJ3HPMLTuN In July, the Douglas Police Department in Arizona seized more than 140 pounds of marijuana launched over the border fence. An officer responding to calls about bundles being launched over found \"a large bundle of marijuana that had broken upon impact, exposing multiple smaller bundles inside,\" CBP said. And last month, Border Patrol agents in Arizona operating remote video surveillance saw an object launched over the border. Other agents then went to the area and found a large cylindrical bundle of marijuana weighing more than 96 pounds and worth $48,000, CBP reported. Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and director of its Drug Policy Project, said he hadn’t heard of any injuries associated with catapults or trebuchets (a common type of catapult). \"Traffickers have definitely used catapults (and trebuchets) to hurl drug packages over the existing wall, but the chance of anyone getting hit by such a package along a 2,000-mile wall is simply laughable,\" Tree said. Other experts also told us that cartels have used catapults to throw marijuana over the border, but they were unaware of anyone actually being hit by the bundles. There are drug catapults and trebuchets that launch loads up to 100 pounds over the border wall, but that happens very rarely. Smaller payloads of 20 to 40 pounds are more common with the drug catapults, said Brandon Behlendorf, an assistant professor at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security & Cybersecurity within University at Albany, SUNY. Trump said, \"So now they take drugs literally and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall and it lands and it hits somebody on the head.\" Trump is accurate that, from time to time, catapults have been used at the border by traffickers. Packages of marijuana thrown over the border range from less than 50 pounds to more than 100 pounds. But we found no reports of people on the U.S. side of the border hit by the falling bundles. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Ron Paul said in December 2007 that if the government stopped collecting income tax, we would have about the same level of funding that we did 10 years ago. \"And the size of government wasn't all that bad 10 years ago,\" concluded Paul, who advocates limited government. It made us wonder: Do today's tax collections, minus the income tax, really equal the tax collections of 10 years ago? We asked Paul's campaign what numbers he used to arrive at that conclusion, but we didn't hear back. So we dug into IRS statistics ourselves. The most recent detailed data available on income tax collected in the United States is for 2005. Besides income tax, the IRS collects corporate taxes, employment taxes, estate and gift taxes, and excise taxes. After issuing refunds, the IRS collected $880-billion in individual income tax in 2005. Subtract that from total tax collections for 2005 – which equaled close to $2-trillion – and you get $1.12-trillion. By comparison, total tax collections in 1995 were about $1.27-trillion. Those are two big numbers that sound close. But take out the calculator: The difference between the two numbers comes to about 12 percent, and when you're talking about the federal government, that's a chunk of change – about $150-billion. To put that in perspective, it would pay for almost a year and half of the war in Iraq. Adjust for inflation, and the gap widens to a roughly 30 percent shortfall. We'll concede that it's possible Paul could reduce the budget by that much, based on some of the positions he advocates. Paul has said he'd like to slash the defense budget by pulling back all U.S. troops on foreign soil, zeroing out foreign aid and reducing the size of the active military. He also advocates abolishing other federal functions, like the Department of Education. Whether he makes up that 12 percent difference or not will have to wait for a Paul presidency. Meanwhile, we find his statement that ending the income tax would roll back revenues 10 years to be Mostly True. \n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]: Joe Scarborough, co-host of the MSNBC show Morning Joe, penned a reflective column for the Washington Post on Sept. 11, 2018, headlined, \"Trump is harming the dream of America more than any foreign adversary ever could.\" Here’s a portion of the column: \"Seventeen years (after the 9/11 attacks), endless wars abroad and reckless policies at home have produced annual deficits approaching $1 trillion. President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence. And while the United States has been mired in endless wars and bloody occupations over the past 17 years, China has used that same period to aggressively develop economic partnerships across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Perhaps that is one reason China will soon overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy.\" It's a common refrain, regardless of who's in the White House.In February 2016, we rated Mostly True a statement by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush that \"Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together.\" So is it really true that \"President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence\"? Pretty much. A few preliminaries. First, there are two common measures for debt. One, called public debt, tallies up the debt held by the public, while gross federal debt is a larger figure that combines publicly held debt plus debt held by the government itself, such as in the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. Both figures are considered legitimate, and since Scarborough didn’t specify which one she was referring to, we’ll run the numbers for both categories of debt. Because debt is cumulative (minus any intervening surpluses) the debt level at the end of a given time period is the cumulative debt up to that point -- you don’t have to add the yearly figures for debt to get the figure Scarborough is referencing. The first question to answer is, when do you start counting to calculate debt for \"the first 200 years of America’s existence\"? (An NBC spokesman didn’t respond to an inquiry.) Probably the most obvious way to do it is to look at the cumulative debt between 1776, the date of the Declaration of Independence, and 1976, the national bicentennial year. At the end of 1976, the public debt was $477.4 billion, and the gross federal debt was just under $629 billion. So how does that compare to Trump’s record? The amount of public debt added in 2017 -- a year when Trump was president for all but 20 days and when the Republicans were in control of Congress -- was $497.8 billion, while the amount of gross federal debt added was $666.3 billion. Whichever variety of debt you use, the amount of debt added under Republican control in 2017 was greater than the accumulated debt by the end of 1976, making Scarborough’s statement correct. (Economists do not typically adjust debt figures for inflation; the figures cited above are nominal dollars.) Meanwhile, projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office suggest that the size of the debt under Trump will only grow from what it was in 2017. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the debt is projected to increase by more than $1 trillion in each year. Some might suggest starting the clock in 1788 -- when the Constitution was ratified -- and stopping it in 1988, rather than starting with pre-Revolutionary War independence. In that scenario, the accumulated public debt over 200 years would be $2.1 trillion and the accumulated general debt would be $2.6 trillion. That would make Scarborough’s calculation incorrect. However, \"I think most people would say America began its existence in 1776,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Beyond the starting date, we see a few caveats. First, Scarborough lays the blame entirely at the Republicans’ feet. However, decisions made by Democrats or by both parties long before Trump’s tenure have shaped how much was added to the debt in 2017. Net interest on the debt accounted for 6.6 percent of federal spending in 2017, and mandatory spending -- outlays that are essentially on autopilot, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- accounted for an additional 63.3 percent of federal spending. So the broad outlines of today’s spending picture were not solely set by today’s Republican congressional majorities and Republican president. Second,the inevitable grind of inflation and population growth puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt. Unless and until the United States reverses course and starts paying down the debt, every new president will preside over ever-larger amounts of debt. A better way to look at debt is by measuring debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, Ellis said. That’s because a more economically productive country can more easily carry a big debt load. And how do those figures look? Here’s a chart. As the chart shows, the current level of debt as a percentage of GDP is not unprecedented (it was higher around World War II) and its growth has eased recently since a spike after the Great Recession. The recession both fed higher spending on the national safety net and weakened the denominator, which is gross domestic product. The chart does show that, when looking at a percentage of GDP, Scarborough is correct in his comparison. Debt as a percentage of GDP in 2017 was farhigher (almost 77 percent) than it was in 1976 (about 27 percent). Scarborough said, \"President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence.\" If you use the period 1776 to 1976, Scarborough is correct. However, it’s worth noting that much of today’s debt picture owes something to guidelines for mandatory spending and net interest for past debts, both of which were shaped by both parties. We rate the statement Mostly True.\n",

But that’s exactly what recent Facebook posts like this one claim. \"AARP endorsed Biden. Biden’s virus committee doesn’t think living past 75 is worth living,\" it says. \"Will you renew your AARP membership since AARP says if you are past 75 you should just die and go away?\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We previously fact-checked another post that said AARP endorsed Biden — that’s False. AARP is a nonpartisan organization that doesn’t endorse political candidates. Jason Young, an AARP spokesperson, told us that the other allegation in this Facebook post is wrong, too. \"Since the early days of the pandemic, AARP has warned policymakers on all sides that rationing care based on age or disability is discriminatory,\" Young said in an email. \"Older people are not political pawns or less worthy to receive care or a vaccine than anyone else.\" Press releases and news coverage in recent months support this. A March 31 press release from AARP titled \"AARP statement against rationing in the distribution of and access to health care\" quotes Nancy LeaMond, the organization's executive vice president. \"Using age or disability to categorically exclude people from accessing treatment would be discriminatory and AARP opposes it,\" she said. An April 9 Wall Street Journal article about state plans to possibly ration ventilators as health care facilities were overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients reported that AARP called for federal policies to protect the elderly and other vulnerable groups from rationing. The Washington Post reported that AARP \"decried age cutoffs for ventilator access in some plans.\" On April 24, AARP sent a letter to the director of the civil rights office at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"It is imperative that those entrusted with deciding who gets access to healthcare do not discriminate,\" the letter said. \"Using age or disability status to categorically exclude people from accessing treatment violates existing federal law and we join you in strongly opposing such discrimination.\" Biden, who was elected president at age 77, did form a coronavirus advisory board that includes Dr. Atul Gawande, a senior adviser in Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration, Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who was an adviser to the agency’s secretary and Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obama administration health policy advisor who in 2014 wrote an essay about reducing medical interventions by choice in old age. But the purpose of the board is to prevent COVID-19 spread, particularly among those most at risk, including the eldery. There is no evidence it advocates the notion that life after 75 isn’t worth living. Our ruling A post on Facebook claims that \"AARP endorsed Biden\" and \"says if you are past 75 you should just die and go away.\" AARP didn’t endorse Biden, or anyone. And the organization, which represents millions of Americans age 50 and older, has aggressively lobbied against any health care policies that would discriminate against aging populations.

            "[Evidences]:Although Boeing may someday introduce a commercial airliner designated with the number 797, and although the company’s Phantom Works (advanced research and development) unit may haveresearched the potential of blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft design for military applications, Boeing is not currently developing a blended-wing aircraft for commercial use, nor does the image displayed below represent any aircraft (or prototype thereof) designed or produced by that company: Boeing to take on Airbus with (1000 seat) giant 797 Blended Wing plane Boeing is preparing a 1000 passenger jet that could reshape the Air travel industry for the next100 years.The radical Blended Wing design has been developed by Boeing in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Centre.The mammoth plane will have a wing span of265 feetcompared to the 747’s211 feet,and is designed to fit within the newly created terminals used for the555 seatAirbus A380,which is262 feetwide.The new 797 is in direct response to theAirbus A380which has racked up159 orders,but has not yet flown any passengers. Boeing decide to kill its 747X stretched super jumbo in 2003 after little interest was shown by airline companies, but has continued to develop the ultimate Airbus crusher 797 for years at its Phantom Works research facility in Long Beach, Calif. The Airbus A380 has been in the works since 1999 and has accumulated$13 billionin development costs, which gives Boeing a huge advantage now that Airbus has committed to the older style tubular aircraft for decades to come. There are several big advantages to the blended wing design, the most important being the lift to drag ratio which is expected to increase by an amazing 50%, with overall weight reduced by 25%, making it an estimated 33% more efficient than the A380, and making Airbus’s$13 billiondollar investment look pretty shaky. High body rigidity is another key factor in blended wing aircraft, It reduces turbulence and creates less stress on the air frame which adds to efficiency, giving the 797 a tremendous 8800 nautical mile range with its 1000 passengers flying comfortably at mach .88 or654 mph(+-1046km/h) cruising speed another advantage over the Airbus tube-and-wing designed A380’s570 mph(912 km/h)The exact date for introduction is unclear, yet the battle lines are clearly drawn in the high-stakes war for civilian air supremacy. This image is a conceptual picture from a Popular Science article about the future of aviation (one which proved so popular that it was made available for purchase in poster form) and has been circulated since at least early 1996 in fictitious articles proclaiming it to be Boeing’s response to competition from the Airbus A380 in the commercial airliner business. A Boeing company blog produced by Randy Baseler, former vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, tackled this subject back in November 2006: From Boulder, Colorado, Walter brings up a topic we frequently get questioned about: the “blended wing” concept. Earlier this year an image of a blended wing “797” made the rounds of the Internet, and got speculation swirling that Boeing has this in the works. Is there any truth to the emails showing a blended wing 1,000-passenger concept that is dubbed a Boeing 797? Makes sense that the airline industry would head this direction some day, but it just sounds too good to be true! Yes, too good to be true, indeed, Walter. Someone was having a bit of fun with PhotoShop perhaps. Boeing is not planning to build a 1,000 passenger commercial airplane dubbed the “797,” based on the blended wing body (BWB) concept or any other futuristic concept. It’s certainly not in our commercial market forecast, which goes out for 20 years. We think the commercial airplane market favors point-to-point routes, and we’re developing the 787 as the perfect match to help meet that demand. Glen, from Warrington, Pennsylvania brings up the same subject: Is there a blended wing in the works? Are there floor plans of it? No, not for a commercial airplane. But having said that, I should point out that Boeing Phantom Works, the company’s advanced research and development group, tells me it is conducting research on the BWB concept with NASA and the U.S. Air Force. They’re working to better understand what they describe as the BWB’s “fundamental edge-of-the-envelope flight dynamics” and structural characteristics. The Air Force is interested in the BWB concept for its potential as a flexible, long-range, high-capacity military aircraft. As part of the research, Phantom Works has built a scale model for wind-tunnel testing of the concept’s low-speed flying characteristics. There also are plans to flight-test the scale model next year. In 2017, Boeing released a teaserimageat the Paris Air Show hyping a medium-range, “middle-market airplane” under development that industry observers unofficially christened “Boeing 797,” but that was neither the real name of the aircraft nor did the visualization include a blended-wing design.\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Donald Trump’s political allegiance has swayed between parties, and a recent Facebook post suggests that Democrats have only accused him of racism since he left their camp. \"Donald Trump has been in public eye for over 30 years,\" the May 16 post says, \"and he was never once accused of being racist by anyone until he decided to run against the Democrats.\" This post, which features photos of Trump with black figures such as civil rights activist Al Sharpton and The Apprentice winner Randal Pinkett, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the truth is that Trump has battled charges of racism almost as long as he has been in the public eye — and long before he stepped into politics. A January 2018 opinion article in the New York Times calls Trump a racist. \"He talks about and treats people differently based on their race,\" the story says. \"He has done so for years, and he is still doing so.\" The piece compiles quotes from Trump from before he ran for president as a Republican in the 2016 election and cites incidents such as when, in the 1970s, Trump’s real estate company \"tried to avoid renting apartments to African-Americans.\" A February Vox article similarly documents what it calls the president’s \"long history of racism\" from the 1970s to date. The story references the first time Trump appeared in the New York Times — Oct. 16, 1973 — when the paper ran a front-page story about a lawsuit against the then-27-year-old and his father. \"Major landlord accused of antiblack bias in city,\" the headline said. The story begins: \"The Department of Justice, charging discrimination against blacks in apartment rentals, brought suit in Federal Court in Brooklyn yesterday against the Trump Management Corporation, a major owners and manager of real estate here. The corporation, which owns and rents more than 14,000 apartments in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in its operation of 39 buildings.\" The DOJ claimed \"Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‘because of race and color,’\" the Times reported. \"It also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available.\" Trump, who was the company’s president, called the charges \"absolutely ridiculous\" and said \"we have never discriminated and never would.\" Trump Management then sued the U.S. government and under a June 1975 agreement the company was required to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies every week for two years. Trump Management said the agreement was not an admission of guilt. Nearly two decades later, in 1989, Trump ran an advertisement in New York City papers calling for the death penalty for the black suspects in the so-called \"Central Park jogger\" case, in which five juveniles were accused of raping and beating a young white woman. (The boys were found guilty but their convictions were overturned after another man admitted to the crime in 2002.) Two black ministers called Trump’s ad a \"thinly veiled racist polemic\" and questioned why he was concerned about the jogger but seemingly unconcerned about a black man who had been chased to his death by white teenagers in Howard Beach, Newsday reported. In 1992, the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino lost its appeal of a $200,000 discrimination penalty \"imposed because managers catered to the presumed prejudices of a high roller by removing a black dealer from his table,\" UPI then reported. Recent news stories have also documented allegations of racism about incidents that happened before Trump ran for president. In 2015, for example, the New Yorker reported on Kip Brown, who used to work at Atlantic City casinos including Trump’s Castle. \"When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,\" the magazine quotes Brown as saying. \"It was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.\" Searching for \"Donald Trump\" and the word \"racist\" in the Nexis news database, we found hundreds of results, including this headline from a May 2011 Hollywood Reporter story: \"Donald Trump denies he’s racist because one ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ winner is black.\" In 2012, after a SignOn.org campaign asking Macy’s to sever ties with Trump over his skepticism of Barack Obama’s birthplace, the singer Cher called him a \"racist cretin\" in a tweet. Our ruling A viral image suggests that Donald Trump was only ever accused of racism after he decided to run for public office against Democrats. The record is clear, however, that Trump has deflected allegations that he is a racist since the 1970s and many times since. We rate this Facebook post False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Addiction is a deeply personal issue for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, whose daughter Noelle suffered from addiction and a string of related criminal charges while he was serving as governor of Florida. In a Medium post on Jan. 5, 2016, Bush offered a glimpse into \"the heartbreak of drug abuse\" that his family had experienced, along with policy proposals to better address addiction. In the column, Bush discussed his record on drug policy during his gubernatorial tenure. \"As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent,\" Bush wrote. Bush took office in January 1999 and left in January 2007. We took a closer look into that statistic. (A few days later, Bush turned Noelle's story into a television ad.) The Bush campaign pointed us to the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey conducted by the Florida Department of Children and Families. (Although several surveys of drug use are released on an annual basis, experts told us that this is the only survey that would speak to the specific numerical claim Bush made.) For heroin use, the survey offers two measurements -- heroin use at any time of one’s life, and heroin use during the past 30 days. For the first category -- use of heroin in one’s lifetime -- 2.2 percent of respondents between the ages of 11 and 18 had used it in 2000, compared to 1.1 percent in 2006. That’s a 50 percent decrease. And for the second category -- heroin use in the past 30 days -- 0.8 percent reported using it in 2000, compared to 0.4 percent in 2006. That’s also down by 50 percent. So numerically, Bush has a point. Still, experts said it’s worth taking those numbers with a grain of salt. Testing the numbers One concern is that the percentage of youth using heroin is small, meaning the differences from year to year are small -- and this makes them potentially unreliable. Indeed, the report itself cautions, \"Heroin use in a school population is extremely rare. Nationally, no lifetime prevalence rate for heroin has exceeded 2.4 percent in the 8th, 10th or 12th grades in the past decade. … Given the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students, analyses that attempt to precisely specify or quantify changes over time are subject to error.\" In addition, for both measurements, the biggest drop came between 2000 and 2001, with minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. That seemed curious to Lloyd Johnston, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study, which tracks drug use in the United States. \"While that is possible, I don't think it very plausible,\" Johnston said. \"Rates almost always change more gradually.\" One possible explanation for that pattern, he said, is that the 2000 survey collected its data in December and January, whereas the 2001 to 2005 surveys conducted their data in April and May of those years. A further curiosity, Johnston said, is that one would not expect a one-year decline that steep for lifetime heroin use. From year to year, the pool of respondents is mostly the same. In the first year, the survey includes youth who are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age. The following year, the 18-year-olds drop out and a new group of 11-year-olds joins, but all the other groups are included again. With such modest changes from year to year in the makeup of the age groups, one would not expect a large change in heroin use over a lifetime from one year to the next, Johnston said. \"That makes the lifetime improvement in 2001 highly implausible,\" Johnston said, adding that a sizable change in the 30-day-rates would be more plausible. What was Bush’s role? There’s also a separate issue: Did Bush’s policies help engineer this decline? That’s hard to say, though drug-policy experts in Florida do praise Bush for his work on the issue. James Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University, said that Bush gave the issue high priority, including the creation of a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education and prevention. The office -- which was later eliminated by Gov. Rick Scott -- made a \"very significant contribution\" to drug policy in the state, Hall said. In addition, Bush championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, Hall said. And his wife Columba was also active in drug- and alcohol-abuse issues, he added. Still, such efforts likely had a \"marginal influence\" on heroin-use rates, Hall said. Often, broader issues such as demographic and social trends have a bigger impact. Indeed, it’s worth noting that heroin use among youth was declining nationally during roughly the same period. Johnston’s own study found that heroin use among youth was declining nationally between 1999 and 2007, the full extent of Bush's term in office. \"For the three grades we study (eighth, 10th, and 12th), the combined prevalence of heroin use during the prior 12 months declined from 1.3 percent in 1999 to 0.8 percent in 2007,\" he said. That’s a drop of about 40 percent -- not far from what the Florida-only survey found. Our ruling Bush said that \"as governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent.\" The only statistics that directly address his statement offer numeric support.However, the report in question cautions against drawing broad conclusions for such low-frequency events as youth heroin addiction, and experts thought it curious that the drop essentially happened in the first year, with little change after that. Experts praise Bush for his drug policies, but it’s important to note that broader demographic and social factors -- reflected in falling youth heroin use nationally during that period -- likely made a difference as well.

            "[Evidences]:The recent World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, held in the Swiss town of Davos from 22 to 26 May 2022 , has already given the false information factory new raw material. \"Pfizer CEO Says it's their dream to Reduce the Population by 50% in 2023,\" reads text on a graphic posted on Facebook in South Africa on 29 May. It includes a blurry photo of two men on a stage with the WEF logo on screens behind them. Pfizer is a global drug company that, with BioNTech , developed and sells the Comirnaty Covid vaccine . The claim is going viral across the world . It comes from a doctored video of Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla in conversation with WEF chairperson Klaus Schwab at the 2022 gathering, on 25 May . In the video, Bourla appears to say : \"It's really a dream, but we had, together with my leadership team when we started in '19 [2019] … to set up the goals for the next five years. And one of them was by 2023 we would reduce the number of people in the world by 50%. I think today, this dream is becoming reality.\" The audience is then heard clapping. The altered video has been posted on Facebook , Twitter and various blogs . It often appears with the same breathless headline : \"EXPOSED!! PFIZER CEO SAYS IT'S THEIR DREAM TO REDUCE THE POPULATION BY 50 PERCENT IN 2023!!\" But Bourla didn't say that. Global drug company plans to halve its customers? The original video can be seen on the World Economic Forum's YouTube channel . The viral clip begins at the 2:35 minute mark. In the key sentence , Bourla says: \"And one of them was by 2023 we would reduce the number of people in the world that cannot afford our medicines by 50%.\" The words \"that cannot afford our medicines\" have been edited out of the video. Bourla was discussing Pfizer's \" accord for a healthier world \" plan to supply its patented drugs on a cost basis, with no profit, to poorer countries. The initiative was announced at the 2022 WEF gathering. Pfizer has been accused of profiteering from the Covid pandemic, milking public health systems needing to vaccinate their people. In 2019 Pfizer's revenue was 0.2% higher than the year before. The 2020 rise was 1.8%. But in 2021, when Covid vaccines were rolled out across the world , Pfizer's revenue shot up by 95.2%, to US$81 billion – \" higher than the GDP of most countries \". And revenue for the 12 months ending 31 March 2022 doubled, up by more than 100% over the previous year. With those huge earnings, and about 32% of the world still to be vaccinated against Covid, Pfizer doesn't have much motive to cut its potential market by half. The bizarre 'depopulation' theory But why was the video edited to make Bourla appear to say his company wanted to \"reduce the number of people in the world by 50%\"? The video attempts to support a broad and jumbled – but worryingly popular – conspiracy theory that \"global elites\" are hell-bent on \" depopulating \" the planet. The conspiracy is said to involve Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations and more. Its supposed methods include not only Covid-19, but vaccines against the disease. Many believers saw proof in the \" Great Reset \", the theme of the 2020 WEF gathering and the title of a book by Schwab . In 2021, Africa Check debunked a claim that in his book, the WEF chair writes that \"at least 4 billion 'useless eaters' shall be eliminated by the year 2050\". The quote actually comes from an obscure book with an odd history , published more than 30 years ago. That claim was false – entirely made up. And the video was intentionally edited to make it appear that Pfizer's CEO said something he didn't. If theorists really believe there's a \"depopulation\" conspiracy, they shouldn't have to fabricate evidence for it. And it's worth mentioning that before the Covid pandemic, Pfizer was best known for its erectile dysfunction drug Viagra . If the company's \"dream\" was to reduce the world's population, it would be unlikely to produce a pill that helps make more people.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: U.S. Census did not confirm that ‘millions less voted in the 2020 election than official results’ showed\n",
            "[Evidences]:Posts saying that the United States Census Bureau reported that 4 million fewer people voted in the 2020 election than official results are false. A report released this year by the bureau that shows numbers of individuals who reported whether they voted or not was misinterpreted. The report does not show official numbers but rather the results of a survey including more than 36 million individuals who did not respond and which the claim did not consider. Examples can be seenhereandhere. The text on one post reads: “READ: Census reveals weird anomaly: Shows MILLIONS less voted in 2020 election than official results.” Some posts link to an article (archivedarchive.ph/Mtnhw) with the same headline as the text above. The article says that “According to the Census, the recorded number of people voting in 2020 was tallied at 154,628,000. On the other hand, official results place the number of actual ballots cast slightly north of 158 million. That’s a discrepancy of nearly four million votes.” Over 159 million people voted in the 2020 Presidential election (www.electproject.org/2020g,here). The U.S. Census “Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2020” report dated April 2021 is visiblehereand the current population survey itself is visiblehere. It is true that this Census report tallies to 154,628,000 for people who reported that they voted. However, this report shows the results of a survey, not an official record of every person who voted in the election. The report recorded responses from 154,628,000 people who reported that they voted and 40,561,000 that reported they did not vote. It also shows 36,404,000 people who were classified as having “no response to voting”, which includes individuals who were not asked if they voted, those who responded “don’t know” or refused to answer. This information is available at the very bottom of the excel sheet in Table 1here. The claims therefore fail to consider whether the over 36 million people who were classified as “no response to voting” cast votes or not.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A Facebook post that features a video viewed millions of times appears to suggest that someone is rapid fire counting ballots cast for President Joe Biden. The seven-second video shows a person’s hand gripping a machine as it zips its way down a massive stack of paper. The caption under the video states: \"Counting Biden's votes at 2am 😂 I’m not much of a conspiracy theorist but I have to admit this was funny.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video was posted by Steve West, founder of Steve’s Outdoor Adventures in Oregon. West told us that someone sent the video to him and that he posted it as a joke. West told us that he thought the equipment in the video was a belt sander. \"It’s just satire — don’t take it seriously,\" West said. \"I took it for what it was: a funny joke, a cool video. It’s for entertainment’s sake. I didn’t realize it inflamed some people and made them angry.\" Some commenters did see it as a joke, but plenty of others saw it as a sign of election wrongdoing. The phrase \"counting Biden’s votes at 2 a.m.\" feeds into the falsehoods that election workers in 2020 \"found\" votes for Biden or in Democratic strongholds such as Detroit in the middle of the night. The fact that election workers process and count ballots late at night is not a sign of fraud. It is routine ballot tabulation. The process took longer in some jurisdictions in 2020 due to the surge in voting by mail. It also takes time for election workers to verify and process mail ballots before they are tabulated. So what is happening in the video? The video appears to show a machine removing stubs off of sheets of paper. Based on the color and size, they are not ballots; election officials and experts told us they knew of no election office that used such a machine for ballots. \"I've never seen any power tool like that used in any stage of ballot processing,\" said Douglas W. Jones, an expert on voting systems and a retired computer science professor at the University of Iowa. \"If I were in the ballot processing business, I wouldn't let anyone go near ballots with a machine like that!\" Election officials in Alabama and Michigan, two states that use ballots with perforated stubs, said they don’t use such a machine for stub removal. In Michigan, Lansing City Clerk Chris Swope said that election workers remove the perforated stub on the ballot by hand before the ballot is fed into a tabulator. The paper in the video appears yellow, but in Michigan the ballots are white, Swope said. And absentee ballots, which are folded, are not as flat as the paper in the video. Another election expert noted the red stripe on parts of the paper, which isn’t a typical part of ballots. Jones said the strips being torn off appear to be about 8 inches long, \"consistent with the bottom edge of a ballot but equally consistent with the bottom edge of just about any billing form.\" An election equipment vendor, Election Systems and Software, told us that the machine in the video is not something they use, and to their knowledge it has nothing to do with ballots. But it appears to be a paper stripper used to get rid of excess paper in a stack. Here is an example of a waste paper/carton stripper on YouTube. We found the same video as the one West posted in a few YouTube videos shared in February. Based on the titles that called it the \"amazing magic machine\" and \"#satisfying,\" it appears users just found the machine mesmerizing. We don’t know the details about the type of paper in this video, but we know that it doesn’t show counting ballots for Biden at 2 a.m. We rate this statement False.

            "[Evidences]:About this rating The video indeed showed an animal — the sun bear, which is the smallest bear in the world — at China's Hangzhou Zoo. In late July 2023, social media users on English and Chinese-speaking social mediaplatformsdebated whether aviral videoof a what appeared to be a bear inside a zoo exhibit was a hoax. Instead of an animal, some users believed, the clip showed a person wearing a bear costume and pretending to be the mammal. They cited its seemingly human-like movements, such as standing and attempting to catch snacks from onlookers, as evidence. \"Real bear? Or man in costume?,\" one social media user asked, another said that the creature seemingly \"stands like a person.\" A Chinese Zoo has attempted to convince visitors that this is a real bear. After this video went viral in China the zoo stated this was in fact a real sun bear. Real bear? Or man in costume? 🐻 pic.twitter.com/oUPBMfZGVp — Oli London (@OliLondonTV) August 1, 2023 The viral video was authentic footage of a bear. In other words, it was not digitally manipulated or edited in an attempt to fool viewers into believing something happened that did not. No bear costume here. The video was recorded at Hangzhou Zoo, which is in China's Zhejiangprovidence. After the false bear-costume rumor gained popularity, the zooconfirmedin a post on WeChat, a Chinese social media app, that the subject of the video was a sun bearnamed Angela. We used Google Translate to translate the post, which was written supposedly from Angela's perspective under the title, \"I'm working hard, but someone suspects that I'm looking for a substitute?\" The post read: Here's the thing: My name is Angela the Sun Bear. Yesterday, after I got off work, I received a call from the director, asking me if I was lazy and did not go to work, so I hired Twolegs to replace me. Unexpectedly, I was sitting in the mountains, and hot searches fell from the sky. Some people think that I am popular when I stand up. It seems that you don't know me too well. Think about it, there were tourists who thought I was petite and not a bear! Let me emphasize again: I am a sun bear! Not a black bear! Not a dog! It's a sun bear! Hangzhou Zoo underscored in the WeChat post some distinct characteristics of sun bears, which are the smallest bear species in the world. When it comes to bears, the first thing that comes to mind must be a huge figure and amazing strength. Our bear family belongs to beasts. The power of bear paws cannot be underestimated. It can smash the back of a cow or smash a car. But not all bears are huge and dangerous personified. Our sun bear is petite, the smallest bear in the world. What's more, the zoo published an image showing a size comparison between small sun bears and far more recognizable Americanblack bears: (Hangzhou Zoo Children's Park on WeChat) Hangzhou Zo's WeChat post continued: Our bears all belong to the Ursidae family, which is mainly divided into three subfamilies, namely the giant panda subfamily, the spectacled bear subfamily and the ursinae subfamily. Our sun bears belong to the Ursinae, and our other brothers are brown bears, American black bears, polar bears, Asiatic black bears, and sloth bears. The body structure of our bear family is that we can stand on our hind legs, and so are the other brothers! Our hair is a jet-black short down, very shiny, our eyes are small, and our ears are also small. We also have a tail, but the tail is very small, about the same length as the ears. In the Getty Images' photograph below, you can see sun bears are not small in relation to their surroundings, but the colors of their back fur make the shape of a frown. Some social media users cited this fact in their debates over whether the viral video showed an animal or not, saying it was\"a human in a suit.\" (Getty Images) The zoo underscored that sun bears are not only able to stand — a characteristic that inspired social media users' false assumption that the in-question creature was actually a human — but they also have a particularly long tongue and a heightened sense of smell: In addition to being able to stand, I have a lot of little secrets to tell you. I also have a specialty, that is, the tongue specialty. Our tongue is one of the longest in the bear family, up to 30 cm long. In order to eat sweet honey, it has evolved an indestructible long tongue covered with rough barbs. With a light stretch, the termites in the hole can be swept away smoothly. Our sense of smell is very sensitive, more than 100 times stronger than that of humans, and we can bark like dogs. Also, we don't hibernate. It's not that the zoo keeps us open, because our hometown is in a warm tropical area, so we don't have the habit of hibernating. Given that the Hangzhou Zoo confirmed the creature in the viral video was a sun bear, and there appeared to be no logical reason for the facility to lie about that fact, we have rated this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\" Various news outlets, such as BBC, CNN, and The Guardian, covered the internet's amusement over the video. Moreover,Chao News reportedvisitor numbers at Hangzhou Zooincreased by 30%, totaling around 20,000 people daily, since the clip surfaced online. It was not the first time someone took note of sun bears' humanlike movements. We found a 2020articlepublished byThe Nature Conservancy,a global environmental organization, entitled, \"Sun Bear: World's Smallest Bear Has Surprisingly Human Traits,\" which read: The data showed that when they would play, like nipping another on the back of the neck and then wrestling, the bears would stop briefly, face each other and exchange expressions. Those expressions sometimes included dropping the lower half of their jaw and wrinkling their noses. \"It reminded me of a diver coming up for air,\" Taylor says. The reason behind sharing expressions is left up to educated guesses, but the results were puzzling because understanding facial cues seems to be a trait among more gregarious, social animals. If sun bears live solitary lives, why did they evolve to understand when their buddies want to play? Mimicking facial expressions was once considered solely a human trait, but that was just because we weren't looking. Researchers then saw this in apes (our closest relatives) and dogs (which live with us). Taylor wonders how many other species have the same abilities that have simply not been documented. We have fact-checked various stories about bears over the years. In March 2021, for instance, we confirmedthe legitimacy of a rumor about a bear that had died after consuming more than 70 pounds of cocaine that had been dumped in a forest during a botched drug-smuggling attempt. Then, in January 2022, we fact-checked drone footage showing a person being chased by a bear in a snowy forest. Also, there's thisseemingly improbable story of a bear named Wojtek who fought with Polish soldiers in World War II.\n",

Photo: AFP/Rodger Bosch\" />The claim that young people, aged between 12 and 21, are most likely both to offend and become to victims of crime is referenced indirectly in the September 2003 issue of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS)’s SA Crime Quarterly journal, in a piece written by Patrick Burton of the Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention (CJCP). It is important to note that the piece is an analysis of crime trends in Meadowlands, a suburb of Soweto, not the country as a whole.The same claim also appears in three other reports from 2005 onwards (see here here and here ). None cite research conducted in South Africa. The sources include a 1998 Israeli National Youth Survey and a 1998 report by researchers from the University of Maryland The research director at CJCP, Lezanne Leoschut, told Africa Check that at the time of the ISS article, South Africa had no data on youth victimisation at all. Lizette Lancaster, project manager of the Crime and Justice Information and Analysis Hub at the ISS, told Africa Check that there was limited funding to conduct national victimisation surveys in South Africa. As a result, researchers sometimes rely on studies from other countries.“Most of Africa is ‘silent’ on victimisation, other than some UN-commissioned studies being done in Kenya and Tanzania,” she added. The findings from these studies cannot be applied to South Africa.A national study carried out by the CJCP provides some insight into youth victimisation. Its 2008 study , which surveyed 4,391 young people between 12 and 22, found that 27% of them had been victims of crime in the previous 12 months. By contrast, a 2007 ISS study of adult victimisation rates found that 20.3% of respondents had been victimised in the last 12 months. However, this study’s sample included people aged 16 and older. This overlaps with the youth sample and hampers comparisons. Neither study provided an overall offending rate.At present, available data from victimisation surveys cannot tell us which age group is more likely to be offenders or victims of crime. The best source of information on youth offending is incarceration data from SAPS, Leoschut said.Rescue workers remove a bus that plummeted off a bridge in Meyerton, south of Johannesburg, killing nineteen people in June 2012. Photo: AFP\" />The 2013 SA report on Mortality and Causes of Death by Statistics SA recorded a total of 5,698 deaths due to transport accidents in all age groups that year, with 2,515, or about 45% of those coming in the 15 to 34 age group. The first number is exactly the same as given by the Youth Policy document, and the other numbers are the same.At first glance, it would appear, therefore, that the claim is correct. However, experts in road safety make clear that these statistics often underestimate the number of deaths.A specialist scientist at the Medical Research Council ’s Burden of Disease Research Unit, Richard Matzopolous, told Africa Check that deaths are often incorrectly categorised by the Department of Home Affairs and this influences the estimates.“Even though reporting of total injury deaths is fairly complete, the [death certificates] have poor coding of injury deaths, that is, a poor distinction between road accidents, other unintentional causes, homicide, etcetera,” Matzopolous said.South African paramedics carry a knife wounded man to be treated at a police station in 2006. Photo: Gianluigi Guercia/AFP\" />Deaths caused by assault and by intentional self-harm, or suicide, are part of a larger category called ‘non-natural’ deaths that also includes deaths other causes such as traffic accidents.According to the Stats SA Causes of Death 2013 report, there were a total of 46,527 non-natural deaths in the country the year before last.As the age groups used in the report are not the same as in the claim, we spoke to Vusi Nzimakwe, Stats SA’s principal statistician for births and deaths. His figures for 2013 showed a total of 5,019 deaths due to assault and 592 due to intentional self-harm, across all age groups. For ages 15 to 34, there were 3,474 deaths due to assault and 348 for suicide.In other words in 2013, 69% of all deaths due to assault and 59% of all deaths due to suicide were of people aged between 15 and 34.The claim is taken directly from Statistics South Africa’s most recent General Household Survey report and reflects a broadly steady picture over recent years, as the figures from the past five surveys show.Source: General Household SurveysThe people polled were asked whether female members of their household between the ages of 12 and 50 years were pregnant in the year before the survey.The problem with such figures is that they don’t tell us how many teenagers became mothers, and people often think they do, Samantha Willan, a research associate at the Health Economics and HIV/Aids Research Division, at the University of Kwazulu-Natal, told Africa Check.“This [data] does not translate to live births and teenage mothers, but rather the number of girls who became pregnant, some of whom may have miscarried, aborted or had stillbirths,” Willan explained.The 2013 General Household Survey (GHS) recorded that 5.4% of girls between 13 and 19 had been pregnant in the previous year. This figure is slightly higher than the figure quoted in the policy document, but the rate has been falling for years and experts think the real figure close enough to call it broadly accurate. Research by the Southern African Labour-Development Research Unit (SALDRU) has shown a gradual and significant decline in teen fertility rates since 1984.Katharine Hall, senior researcher at the Children’s Institute at the University of Cape Town, told Africa Check she thought the claim was broadly correct. In her analysis of the 2013 survey’s data, she used slightly different age groups and found that 4.2% of females aged 15-17 were reported to have been pregnant and 12.3% of those aged 18-20 had been pregnant. “The results are also broadly consistent with more detailed analysis of teenage fertility rates (i.e. live births), conducted by SALDRU and based on data over a 15-year period,” she said.It is more useful to reflect on the overall trend of teenage pregnancy rather than one year’s statistics, she added.Edited by Anim van Wyk and Peter Cunliffe-Joneshttps://africacheck.org/reports/national-youth-policy-unemployment-and-education/\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration’s \"zero-tolerance\" policy to prosecute all immigrants who enter the United States illegally, saying not prosecuting them would be a \"disservice\" to the country and an \"insult\" to those who come to the United States legally. Sessions said \"adults are only being arrested\" because they didn’t come to the United States through a port of entry \"where they could have applied for asylum lawfully.\" (That’s not accurate. Immigrants can apply for asylum even if apprehended at the border, regardless of immigration status.) \"But many do not apply for asylum, of course\" Sessions said June 25 before the National Association of School Resource Officers. \"And our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief.\" Is Sessions accurate that 80 percent of immigrants who apply for asylum \"do not merit the relief\"? We asked the Justice Department about Sessions’ claim, pointing to Sessions’ prepared remarks posted on the department’s website saying: \"courts find that 80 percent of asylum claims are without merit.\" In fiscal year 2017 there was a 20 percent grant rate for asylum applications, \"which suggests that most are not meritorious,\" Justice Department spokesman Devin M. O’Malley told PolitiFact. But experts told us it’s not that clear cut that the remaining 80 percent of asylum applications are not merited. There are several other reasons why an asylum claim is not granted, experts told us. Here’s a closer look at the issue. The Justice Department pointed to immigration court statistics, particularly a table on asylum rates for the latest full fiscal year, 2017. A footnote for that table said the data is for asylum decisions on affirmative and defensive applications issued in completed removal, deportation, exclusion, and asylum-only proceedings. (\"Affirmative asylum\" is filed voluntarily with Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; if USCIS is unable to approve a case, the agency may refer it to immigration court within the Justice Department. \"Defensive asylum\" applications go before an immigration judge and are filed by individuals who are in removal proceedings.) Here’s what the 2017 asylum rates said: • Grant rate: 20.22 percent • Denial rate: 33.51 percent • Other closure rate: 27.66 percent • Administrative closure rate: 18.61 percent The \"other\" rate is for cases that have a decision of abandonment, not adjudicated, other, or withdrawn. The administrative closure rate covers \"decisions that have not been placed back on the docket following a granted motion to recalendar,\" the footnote for the table said. Just because the grant rate is about 20 percent, it does not mean that an 80 percent aren’t qualified, or don’t merit relief, as Sessions claimed. As the Justice Department table showed, there are several other factors at play. It’s also worth noting that the data the Justice Department highlighted includes \"affirmative asylum\" cases, which initiate with USCIS and are referred to immigration court. Affirmative asylum applicants are not in removal proceedings, as would be people apprehended at the border due to the \"zero-tolerance\" policy. Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed to other data released in the Justice Department’s fiscal year 2016 statistics yearbook. It showed a 31 percent grant rate in 2016 for defensive asylum claims. Border claims would fall into that pile (along with some others), Gilman said. Immigration law experts told us that some asylum cases can also be denied while still having viable claims. It is not accurate to infer that because only 20 percent of claims were granted that the rest were not meritorious, said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School. \"Many cases are denied for procedural reasons not related to the merit of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented and therefore don't have the chance to make their case in an effective way,\" Gordon said. She also said that cases decidedby asylum officersare not counted in the immigration court statistics. Access to counsel significantly impacts the outcome of a case, said Lori A. Nessel, a law professor and director of Seton Hall University School of Law's Center for Social Justice. \"When asylum-seekers are detained, they are much less likely to have lawyers and without lawyers, they are less likely to even seek asylum or other relief, much less be granted,\" Nessel said. Immigrants, including asylum applicants, also do fare better in some courts than in others, said Stephen Meili, associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. An October 2017 story published on NJ.com noted disparities in outcome of cases, with immigrants faring better in courts in Newark, N.J. than in Atlanta. Greater access to lawyers in the Newark and New York area could determine success in courts, the story said. In discussing merit, it's also important to count the number of cases that are reversed by the board of immigration appeals or by one of the circuit courts of appeals,said James Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan Law School. Sessions said, \"Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief.\" Sessions’ claim is based on Justice Department data showing a 20 percent asylum grant rate in 2017. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the remaining 80 percent were without merit. The data the Justice Department used to support Sessions’ remark actually undercut his point. Some cases had not been adjudicated or placed in the court docket. Immigration law experts also said that even if a case is denied, it could still be meritorious, but unsuccessful in court because an applicant did not have a lawyer. Sessions’ claim is not accurate. We rate it False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Some Facebook commenters focused on professional sports leagues’ support of Black Lives Matter when they read this Facebook post: \"BLM injures 1000 police officers kills 36 people and does $8 billion in damage and gets celebrated by pro sports?\" We focused on the rest, and found that the biggest problem with the post, leaving aside the numbers claimed, is the lack of proof that Black Lives Matter caused the violence that is claimed. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The latest flareup of protests against police brutality began May 26 in Minneapolis, where the previous day, George Floyd, a Black man, died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck. As we reported two weeks after the protests began, a review of demonstrations in five major cities found that all of the protests started with violence, but then became largely peaceful. As for the numbers claimed in the post, the U.S. Justice Department told us it does not have figures on officer injuries or property damage resulting from civil disturbances, and the FBI said it had no comment. There are scattered news reports that don’t entirely back up each part of the claim, and we found no official figures. Officers injured: The New York Post reported on June 8, citing the U.S. Justice Department, that more than 700 law enforcement officers were injured on the job during nationwide protests over Floyd’s death. People killed: In early June, news accounts reported the number of people killed during the Floyd protests at roughly a dozen, or as many as 19. The victims include a 77-year-old man who was a retired St. Louis police captain and a 22-year-old woman from Davenport, Iowa. Damage caused: In late June, Fox News reported that according to insurance experts and city officials, the Floyd protests could eclipse the 1992 Los Angeles riots to become the most expensive civil disturbance in U.S. history. The 1992 riots, which followed the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of Rodney King, cost $1.4 billion in 2020 dollars, according to the report, which did not give a specific damage estimate for the Floyd protests. A spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute told Scripps National News that \"most likely\" the Floyd protest \"would lead to higher losses,\" but did not provide an estimate either. Black Lives Matter didn’t respond to our requests for comment. There is a Black Lives Matter national organization, which says it has more than a dozen U.S. chapters, along with countless numbers of individuals who support the organization. As the New York Times reported July 3, four recent polls \"suggest that about 15 million to 26 million people in the United States have participated in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd and others in recent weeks. These figures would make the recent protests the largest movement in the country’s history, according to interviews with scholars and crowd-counting experts.\" There are also people who have participated in demonstrations, which have occurred in hundreds of cities, who may have no allegiance to Black Lives Matter, or may even oppose it, and have rioted or committed other acts of violence — making it even more difficult to determine how a violent incident occurred. What’s more, news coverage of the protests have also included numerous reports that identify law enforcement officers as causing injury to civilians. In short, there isn’t evidence to back the numbers in the claim or to blame Black Lives Matter for each part of the claim. Our rating is False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Barack Obama's plan gives a driver's license to any illegal who wants one.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:With a new television ad, a conservative group is trying to revive the debate over drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants, which flared up in the Democratic nomination race but has not been a major issue in the general election. The ad debuted on Oct. 21, 2008, and is set to run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states, according to scriptwriter and producer Rick Wilson. \"Millions of illegal aliens in the U.S.,\" begins the spot, paid for by an independent political action committee called the National Republican Trust. \"Barack Obama's plan gives a driver's license to any illegal who wants one.\" For good measure, the spot includes an image of 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta on a driver's license. Since the ad made an allegation about \"Obama's plan,\" we checked his Web site for any plan that mentioned drivers' licenses for undocumented immigrants. We couldn't find one. Obama'simmigration plandoesn't have anything to say on the subject. In phone interviews, Wilson and the PAC's executive director, Scott Wheeler, pointed to comments madeby Obama in three debates during the Democratic primary as evidence for the claim. In the first debate, on Oct. 30, 2007, NBC's Brian Williams asked Obama whether he was for or against a plan by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York to grant licenses to illegal immigrants. \"I think that it is a— the right idea,\" Obama said. \"Because there is a public safety concern. We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer.\" In another debate, on Nov. 15, 2007, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Obama, \"Do you support or oppose drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants?\" \"I am not proposing that that's what we do,\" Obama said. \"I have already said I support the notion that we have to deal with public safety and that drivers' licenses at the state level can make that happen. ... But what I also know, Wolf, is that if we keep on getting distracted by this problem, then we are not solving it.\" Blizter went on to press for a yes or no answer. \"Yes,\" Obama said. In a third debate, on Jan. 31, 2008, Obama said: \"On the drivers' license issue, I don't actually want— I don't believe that we're going to have to deal with this if we have comprehensive immigration reform because, as I said before, people don't come here to drive, they come here to work.\" He continued, \"I agree with Bill Richardson (who supported granting drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants) that there is a public safety concern here and that we're better off— because I don't want a bunch of hit-and-run drivers because they're worried about being deported and so they don't report an accident.\" So yes, Obama did indeed endorse the idea of granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants. But does that amount to a \"plan\" to do so? In the context of the presidential campaign, we think of a \"plan\" as a specific course of intended action a candidate has laid out, usually in writing. Voicing support at a debate for an idea— especially couched in qualifiers such as \"I don't believe that we're going to have to deal with this,\" and \"I am not proposing that that's what we do\"— is a far cry from having a plan to do so. \"When we say 'Obama's plan' we're saying it's part of his plans, not necessarily thathe's created a plan,\" Wheeler said. But it's not part of his immigration plans. We also note that drivers' licenses are handled on the state level, and Obama is running for federal office. The federal government can impose standards on states for drivers' licenses that would be federally recognized— and in fact Congress did so in 2005 when it passed elements of what had been known as the Real ID Act. It said states have to require \"valid documentary evidence that the person (applying for a license) is a citizen or national of the United States\" or has applied for any of several types of legal status. Obama voted for that bill, which passed 99-0. We could not find any evidence that he had a plan to change those requirements, other than his debate comments, which don't amount to much of a plan. Finally, Obama saying he favored the idea of giving drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants is different from saying he would give them to \"any illegal who wants one,\" as the ad claimed. If Obama were to offer a specific plan on the subject, who knows what restrictions it would include? Certainly not the National Republican Trust. So this group is guilty of some serious hyperbole. It took words of support from Obamaforthe concept of granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants and portrayed them not just as a specific plan, but as one that would hand licenses out like candy. We find it Barely True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:As fire crews battledNorthern California’s Camp Fire,now the deadliest in the state’s history, and the Woolsey Firefarther south, social media users shareda story that partially places the blame for California’s wildfire woes on Gov. Jerry Brown. The Camp Fire has claimed the lives of more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes. A recent article by the Canada Free Press, a conservative Canadian news and opinion website, has been circulating online with a headline that says Gov. Jerry Brown \"vetoed 2016 wildfire management bill while California burned.\" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So did Brown actually veto a bill that would have helped scale back the prevalence of wildfires in the state? Not exactly, but the claim isn’t completely off. Let’s take a look. The 2016 piece of legislation in question, SB 1463, would have required the California Public Utilities Commission and Cal Fire (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection) to prioritize communities with conditions that could increase fire hazards associated with overhead utilities wires. What does that mean? The bill aimed to reduce the risk of power lines sparking fires in wooded areas and required the updating of fire safety maps. The maps determine whether utility companies have to clear brush in areas near overhead wires in order to alleviate the risk of fires. Related coverage:Examining Jerry Brown’s veto of California wildfire legislation and the criticism of it Brown did veto the bill, but there is no direct evidence to suggest that the action increased the probability of wildfires. The commission also said it was already doing similar work before the proposal came along. But there are a still a few things to question here. SB 1463 had been unanimously approved by the state legislature and many have questioned why the governor would veto a bill that was unopposed. In his veto message, Brown says it’s because it would have duplicated efforts, pointing out that agencies were already addressing the matter and that the process should continue \"in that forum.\" Jamie Court, president of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog Report, a progressive organization that advocates for taxpayer and consumer interests, disagrees, writing that the negligence of the state’s public utilities and Gov. Brown’s failure to regulate them contributed to the fierce spread of past and current wildfires. Citing reporting by the Bay Area News Group, Court says that since the 2007 San Diego wildfires, PG&E (Pacific Gas and Electric Company) had stalled the creation of the new fire maps within the utility commission’s process. Court argues that the stonewalling, along with former PG&E executives being some of Brown’s top aides, sheds light on the governor’s role in the rapid spread of the state’s wildfires. But the California Public Utilities Commission has said the bill would have actually prolonged the safety work already going on by \"requiring the participation of certain entities, which was unnecessary because Cal Fire was already a party to the proceeding, and local governments and fire departments could also participate.\" The commission also said that Cal Fire already has hazard maps, and based on those, people who live in high-risk areas face tougher construction standards. Regardless of which way you look at it, the statewide Fire-Threat Map was updated and approved in January 2018. A widely shared Canada Free Press article links California Gov. Jerry Brown’s veto on a 2016 bill to the prevalence of the state’s wildfires over the past couple of years. It is accurate that Brown vetoed the bill, but the legislation only addressed one piece of wildfire management —a piece already being implemented by fire services and the state’s utility commission. The commission also said the bill would have slowed down their work. But some argue that for years the commission unnecessarily slowed the process of updating the fire safety maps, which played a role in failing to curb preventable wildfire damage. The maps were eventually updated and approved in January 2018. The story contains elements of truth, but fails to provide all the details. We rate it Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A very widely shared post on Twitter , and several posts on Facebook , have claimed that Private Eye magazine reported that the former chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is being paid £20,000 a month to work as an adviser for a hedge fund. This is not correct. Private Eye reported that Mr Kwarteng was paid to work for a hedge fund shortly after he was elected to Parliament in 2010—but did not say that he has continued to work for it since then, or that he was being paid £20,000 a month. The Private Eye story actually claimed that after becoming an MP in 2010, Mr Kwarteng \"kept up his financial interests with a £20,000 side number for providing 'political advice' to Odey Asset Management\", though we've not seen evidence to support this figure and it doesn't appear to match the official record of Mr Kwarteng's interests. The House of Commons Register of Members' Financial Interests shows that Mr Kwarteng registered in March 2011 that he would be paid \"£10,000 on a half-yearly basis\" for work as \"Consultant to Odey Asset Management\", which would involve \"giving political advice to asset managers in relation to international and domestic affairs\". This was updated in September 2011 to say \"Remuneration: £10,000. February to August 2011 only.\" No further payments from Odey Asset Management to Mr Kwarteng appear in the register after that. Private Eye said on Twitter that some of the social media commentary about its article was not correct . We asked Private Eye why it reported the total as £20,000 instead of £10,000. It told us that £10,000 does appear to be the correct figure. Mr Kwarteng's office did not respond to a request for comment, and Odey Asset Management declined to comment.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:On Twitter, GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Michael Wiiliams of Texas urged online pals to join him in seeking a national policy encouraging all forms of energy production, writing: \"Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office. We need More American Energy.\"Williams adds on his campaign website: \"If I didn’t know better, I’d think President Obama is actually trying to see what $5 gasoline looks like.\"Energy policy aside, did Williams accurately peg the price of gas on Obama’s watch?After leaving Williams a message, we drilled for price changes since Obama took office in 2009 and during previous presidencies.First, a little perspective: Presidents can’t do anything to lower gas prices in the short term, an energy policy expert at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota recently told WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. In an April 27 post, the station quotes associate professor Elizabeth Wilson saying that the United States doesn’t have a lot of control over prices because \"oil is an international commodity, fungible commodity, traded on international markets.\"Presidents can tap the nation’s strategic oil reserves, which President George W. Bush did in 2005, causing oil prices to drop 10 percent. But, Wilson said, \"you could argue that the high prices, while painful, are not potentially strategic reasons to drain the reserves.\"Or, she said, the president could go after speculators who some blame for driving up the price of oil. Speculative energy contracts have increased 35 percent since the unrest in Egypt began in January; the government could limit the number of contracts big players could purchase, though Wilson said that’s unlikely to have an immediate impact on prices at the pump.Gas prices have caught Obama’s attention. On May 14, he said in his weekly radio address: \"Without a doubt, one of the biggest burdens over the last few months has been the price of gasoline.\" He said he was ordering various governmental moves, including annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve to speed the evaluation of oil and gas resources in the mid and south Atlantic.How much have gas prices gone up since Obama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009?That week, the average per-gallon price of unleaded gas in Texas was $1.72, according to the AAA, which tracks prices at the pump by daily surveying more than 100,000 self-service gas stations. It was $3.77 the week of Williams’ tweet--up $2.05.That price was still shy of the July 2008 average of $3.97, the highest average Texas price during predecessor George W. Bush’s presidency, a $2.55 increase from the week Bush began his first term in 2001. In his first two-plus years--the period comparable to where Obama is today-- the average per-gallon Texas price of unleaded gas scarcely shifted, going from $1.42 to $1.47, according to AAA.Next, we looked at national retail prices for all formulations of gas posted online by the EIA. That information, starting from mid-August 1990, suggests that such prices bumped up less than a dime in the comparable part of Bill Clinton’s presidency and about 10 cents in the matching portion of George W. Bush’s first term—compared to about $2.10 for Obama.Another EIA chart shows annual prices for unleaded gas over the five presidencies preceding Obama. Adjusted for 2005-value dollars, the national price went up from $1.74 to $2.06 in the first three years of Jimmy Carter’s presidency; from $2.64 down to $2.15 in that part of Ronald Reagan’s tenure; up from $1.47 to $1.53 for George H.W. Bush; from $1.42 down to $1.41 for Clinton; and up from $1.61 to $1.69 for the second Bush president.Next, we wondered about the cause/effect relationship implied by Williams’ statement. That is, Is it fair to saddle any president with responsibility for the price of gas at the pump?The U.S. Energy Information Administration calls the price of crude oil the \"main contributor to the general increase in retail gasoline prices since the start of 2009.\" Its March 22 post lists several factors affecting the price of crude oil including political events in the Middle East and North Africa, shifts in inventory levels, gradual improvements in the economies of the world and bumps in profits taken by gasoline refiners.Regardless, presidents historically get blamed when the price of gas increases and they aren’t necessarily rewarded when it falls, according to a May 2006 Bloomberg Business Week story. It states that the price-at-the-pump problem has \"bedeviled presidents at least since 1973, when the Arab oil embargo created gas lines, a price spiral toward 55 cents per gallon, and an additional headache for President Richard Nixon. Of course, price spikes aren't the sole cause of falling presidential popularity. The relationship is a correlation, and other factors contribute to public perceptions of a president.\"Our take? Gas costs $2 more per gallon than it did when Obama took office; in the past 35 years, no other president saw such a price surge by this point of his presidency. However, Williams errs by implying the president is at fault; key factors driving gas prices are beyond a president’s control.We rate the statement Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Is South Africa the \"rape capital of the world\"? Do 4% of rape cases end in conviction? And is sex education \"non-existent\" in South African schools? These were some of the claims made in an article published online by the Telegraph. ( Note: They closely resemble statistics used in an article published in January 2014 on fellow British media group The Independent's website.) When the article was first published, Africa Check immediately pointed out that Interpol has never labeled South Africa the \"rape capital of the world\". The claim has been circulating since at least 2000 but the organisation, which facilitates international police cooperation, previously told us that \"unfortunately these false reports have been repeated by various media, without verification with [Interpol]\". The claim was then removed without the Telegraph acknowledging the error in the original version. Sexual violence is one of South Africa's most pressing issues. Research guide us to possible solutions. Do the Telegraph's statistics aid in this? We contacted the journalist and asked for the sources for the rest of her claims. At the time of publishing we had not received a response. If we do, we will update this report. Rape rate Claim \"South Africa has one of the highest rates of rape in the world.\" Verdict correct The South African Police Service's most recently released crime statistics showed that 46,253 rapes were reported to the police in 2013/14. That year South Africa had an estimated 52.3 million inhabitants which works out to 87 rapes reported for every 100,000 people then in the country. Figuring out where South Africa ranks globally is harder to do. Statistics on rape in 2013 from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) only list 79 countries, most of them in Europe. South Africa's rape rate is not included on the list, but it is higher than the top three: Sweden (59), England and Wales (36) and Costa Rica (35). Differences in how rape is defined internationally, different ways of counting rapes and the number of cases that are not reported to the police make straight comparisons impossible , however. In England, for example, rape offences are counted according to the number of victims . So if a woman is raped by two men it is recorded as one crime with the offenders acting together. In South Africa, a rape offence should be recorded for every penetration that occurred without the victim's consent. Reporting to police Claim \"Of the estimated 500,000 rapes that take place every year, only one in nine are reported.\" Verdict unproven While we know how many rapes were reported in 2013/14, we do not know how many rapes were committed. To get an idea of that you need to research how many rapes were not reported to the police, but there are no such recent studies for South Africa. South Africa's 1998 Demographic and Health Survey found that 15.2% of women aged 15-49 - or about one in 7 in this age group - had \"sought help\" from the police when they were raped . A 2002 study estimated that only one in nine rapes and attempted rapes were reported to the police. We tried to contact the authors to find out how this figure was calculated and will update the report when we receive clarification. Guilty verdicts Claim \"For every 25 men brought to trial for rape, 24 will walk free...\" Verdict unproven South Africa's National Prosecution Authority (NPA) was unable to give us the number of rape cases that ended in guilty verdicts. Instead they provided the conviction rate for all sexual offences for 2014/15, which was 69%. A conviction rate is the percentage of cases brought to trial that ended in a conviction. For example, 5,484 sexual offences cases resulted in convictions in 2013/14 of the 8,174 cases that went to court, a rate of 67.1% . However, that year there were 62,649 sexual offences cases reported to the police . The police lump all sexual offences in a broad crime category that includes offences such as rape, sexual assault, bestiality, flashing and public masturbation. Sanja Bornman, an attorney at the non-profit Women's Legal Centre , told Africa Check that the organisation had struggled in the past to determine the conviction rate for rape cases. \"It's very difficult to find out how many of the sexual offences convictions were rape convictions. This is because no disaggregated data is made publicly, and readily, available,\" said Bornman. Victim blaming Claim \"According to research by the anti-violence NGO, CIET, 20% of men said the victim 'asked for it'.\" Verdict incorrect Between 1997 and 2000 CIET, an epidemiological research and training organisation, conducted a survey of 2,059 men and 3,967 women in the south of Johannesburg. The survey found that 85% of men surveyed said that they remembered someone who had been raped. Of those men, 16% said that they thought the women \"asked for it\". A gender specialist at the Institute for Security Studies, Romi Sigsworth, told Africa Check that the study's findings could not be applied to present-day South Africa. \"This data... is very dated,\" said Sigsworth. She added that the findings were about an area in Johannesburg and were not nationally representative of South Africa. Gang rape Claim \" In a related survey, a quarter of Soweto schoolboys described \"jackrolling\" – a local term for gang rape – as 'fun'.\" Verdict unproven This claim abounds on the internet and the International Business Times and the Mail and Guardian have referred to it, among others. It was reported as early as 1999 by the BBC and The Christian Science Monitor . Africa Check was unable to track down any research that supported the claim, however. Other researchers have tried to verify the claim before, like Katherine Franks, a cultural anthropologist and sex researcher now at American University . In a book she wrote on group sex Franks noted that the claim \"is widely reported… although the original study is elusive\". Sex education Claim \"Sex education is non-existent\" Verdict incorrect Sex education is part of the South African school curriculum, which outlines what should be taught in each phase of schooling: Grade Topics included in the curriculum R-3 Who may or may not touch my body, practising saying 'no' and how to report abuse. 4-6 How to respect others' bodies, relationships, HIV and AIDS education, gender stereotyping, sexism and abuse. 7-9 Puberty, HIV and AIDS, sexuality, gender equity, sexual behaviour and sexual health. 10-12 Reproductive systems, teenage pregnancy, gender roles, stereotyping, risk of pregnancy, sexually-transmitted infections, abuse of power in society (eg. domestic violence, sexual violence and rape). Sources: CAPS curriculum grade R-3 , CAPS curriculum grade 4-6 , CAPS curriculum grade 7-9 , CAPS curriculum grade 10-12 . Although sex education is compulsory how, or if, it is taught depends on individual teachers and schools, professor of psychology at Rhodes University and expert on sex education, Catriona Macleod, told Africa Check. \"Gender relations and sexual diversity are also supposed to be covered. However, research shows that teachers are often uncomfortable covering sexuality education and may either avoid it or teach in moralistic ways,\" said Macleod. To prevent this, the department of basic education has \"initiated a process of developing scripted lesson plans that lead the teacher through the lesson in a logical and specified way\", their spokesman, Elijah Mhlanga, told Africa Check. Lifetime risk Claim \"Up to 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime according to the South African Institute of Race Relations, but estimates vary widely due to underreporting.\" Verdict incorrect The South African Institute of Race Relations ' chief executive officer, Frans Cronje, told Africa Check that he didn't think the claim originated from the organisation. \"The [Institute of Race Relations] publishes an extraordinary number of documents, articles and publications in any given year… but we cannot place the statistic cited in the Telegraph nor do we have any immediate recollection of having published that statistic in the past,\" said Cronje. There are no recent, nationally representative statistics on the prevalence of rape in South Africa. Lisa Vetten, a researcher specialising in gender violence at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research, told Africa Check that the most recent research was from a 2010 survey of women in Gauteng . It found that a quarter of women aged 18 and older had been raped in their life time. This data, however, does not apply to the whole of South Africa.\n",

In 2017, he signed a five-year, $171 million contract with the Pistons. His real estate portfolio in the Los Angeles area is conservatively valued at $35 million.

            "[Evidences]:Will article 54 of Obamacare come into effect on May 1, 2018 and will that mean that 30 percent of social security will be taken away from people over 60 so it can be given to insurance for undocumented immigrants? No, that's not true, illegal imigrants will not be getting insurance with this money because it won't be taken away in the first place. The claim is fake news spread via an image posted on a Facebook page specifically designed to upset and troll conservatives and Trump supporters. An image of former President Obama with following text superimposed was posted to a Facebook page named \"America - Love It Or Leave It\": On May 1st, 2018 article 54 of Obamacare will take effect. Anyone over 60 will have 30 percent of their social security diverted to funding for insurance for the undocumented. The post was published on April 14, 2018 (archived here) with no extra text to accompany the image. However the Facebook page that posted it has following description in its about tab: Nothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned. Should you doubt that, you can read the full text of the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act here, since that is the full name of what is commonly refered to as Obamacare. We weren't able to locate any article 54 but the entire act does not even contain the word \"undocumented\" anyway as far as we were able to determine. The Facebook page in question belongs to a network of Facebook pages and websites that troll conservatives and Republicans under the guise of satire. The owner and main writer of the network of sites is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, thelastlineofdefense.online and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote. Articles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down. If you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"One of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio largely battled each other during the Republican debate in Las Vegas, including when Cruz accused Rubio of supporting a bill to let refugees into the country without first being vetted. Cruz singled out what he saw as a major flaw of a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill by the so-called Gang of Eight, which included Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Border security is national security, and you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever,\" Cruz said. Did Rubio really back an immigration bill that would have allowed refugees from countries in turmoil to come in sans screening? It appears Cruz should work on his own vetting process. Presidential power The Cruz campaign did not get back to us when we asked how S. 744 — which passed the Senate (with Cruz voting no) in 2013 but wasn’t taken up in the House — would have granted the president this power. But when our friends at FactCheck.org looked at a similar claim earlier in December, Cruz’s office directed them to a column by Daniel Horowitz on ConservativeReview.com, a site that named Cruz \"America’s Top Pick\" among GOP candidates. Horowitz highlighted three sections of the bill to justify how the legislation would have opened up the country to substantial refugee risk. \"Had the bill passed in 2013, it would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless,\" he wrote. \"Most of those likely to be designated as stateless are from Islamic hell holes and would include the Syrians, Somalis, Palestinians, and the Muslim Rohingya in Burma.\" Horowitz told us the bill would have granted Obama sweeping power to bestow refugee status on groups as he saw fit. He also said it did nothing to establish standards for background checks on so-called \"stateless\" refugees, who already can’t be checked because there are no databases or information to consult, an argument Rubio has used to argue for prohibiting entry for Syrian refugees. PolitiFact has found that while there may be data gaps, there is a process to vet Syrian refugees. We spoke to several experts, including two resettlement agency officials interviewed by FactCheck.org. We found that their analyses of the bill don’t support Cruz’s claim about new \"blanket authority\" for Obama to admit refugees without any checks. We’ll start with the big picture. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us the bill did propose sweeping changes, including allowing the government to identify persecuted groups. That could be almost any group in the Middle East, he said. \"The bottom line is that the bill gave the president huge new power that could have changed the refugee system,\" he said. But in the way Cruz alleged? Other experts said no. For one, the president has long had broad authority over refugee admission limits. \"S. 744 didn’t give the president ‘blanket authority to admit refugees,’ \" David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said in an email. \"The president has had the power since the Refugee Act of 1980 to establish limits on refugees in consultation with Congress. S. 744 didn’t affect this authority.\" From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2015. Partly in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, that total will increase to 85,000 refugees in fiscal year 2016 and 100,000 in fiscal year 2017. In 2016, the administration plans to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees almost six-fold to at least 10,000. What’s more, the Gang of Eight proposal specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks, Bier added. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. For Syrian refugees, it takes two years on average. Cruz’s claim already misses these important points, but there are some specifics that experts say show his statement is inaccurate. ‘Stateless’ status One point is whether the bill would have allowed Obama to let in any group of refugees, Syrian or otherwise, and give them legal status. Section 3405 would have allowed the attorney general or the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to provide lawful status to a refugee considered \"stateless\" — meaning, they had no country to which the United States could otherwise send them. \"A classic case is a person who entered the United States and applied for asylum whose country dissolved while they were awaiting their hearing and decision in the case,\" said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. \"If they were denied asylum and ordered deported, there is no country left to accept them as their national.\" Kelsey cited as an example people who were in the United States when the Soviet Union collapsed and new countries were formed from their home regions. But the \"stateless\" classification wouldn’t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, only people who are already in the country or would face this situation in the future. Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, another refugee resettlement group, said this would not have changed the number of immigrants allowed into the country. The provision only applied to domestic law, he said, and people would have to prove this status, not just declare it. Persecution problem Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a \"well founded fear of persecution.\" Our expert sources said section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making the individual prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. Its aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. \"It doesn’t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States,\" Bier said. \"They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants.\" Deadline dilemma One final piece concerns the current one-year deadline in place for refugees to file for asylum once they arrive in the United States. Section 3401 would have repealed the deadline, and given people who had applications rejected for missing the window another two years to apply again. There are any number of reasons people miss the deadline — they don’t know they can apply, they’re afraid of government officials or even that they were hoping things in their home countries would get better so they could leave the United States and return. But again, it would only apply to refugees already in the United States, not people seeking to come in the future. Our experts said any worries that this would increase fraudulent immigration are unfounded. \"This provision does not alter any standards or safeguards in the asylum system. All asylum seekers would continue to undergo rigorous security background checks and show that they are admissible to the United States,\" Kelsey said. Our ruling Cruz said, \"One of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever.\" The failed 2013 bill did not change the number of refugees, the overall framework of the screening process or give the president authority to admit any group at will. It would have allowed the president to designate certain groups outside the United States as particularly at risk, and other officials to label certain refugees in the United States as having nowhere to go. It further would have repealed the deadline for refugees already here to apply for asylum. Experts said none of the provisions Cruz has previously cited work the way he is warning they would.

            "claim [Claim]: Children as young as 12 can access assisted dying services in British Columbia, Canada.\n",
            "[Evidences]:A Facebook video claims children in Canada as young as 12 can legally access same-day voluntary assisted dying . Canadian online commentator Brad Wozny issued the warning to Australians during a discussion with a NSW-based freedom group. “It is already active in Canada,” he said, adding that similar legislation is coming “for every commonwealth country”. However, the claim is false. Canadian health authorities told AAP FactCheck minors are excluded from accessing medically assisted dying services. In the video on the Stop the Rot Sack the Lot page from February 1, Mr Wozny claims Canada has implemented “same-day suicide for kids 12 and up”. “If you’re in the province of British Columbia right now, it takes 162 days for you to get a kneecap surgery, but you can be 12 years old and walk in with a legal guardian and with verbal consent only, they will suicide you,” he says (video mark 7min 06sec). The Facebook video spreads misinformation about Canada’s assisted dying laws. Assisted dying in Canada is only available to people aged over 18 who meet strict eligibility criteria. It requires a series of safety checks from multiple independent medical practitioners, including written consent, before being approved. The Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) laws were implemented in 2016 after Canada’s Supreme Court ruled a prohibition on voluntary assisted dying violated the nation’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms . A representative for Canada’s Public Health Agency told AAP FactCheck that minors were excluded when MAID was legalised. The Canadian government commissioned a study in 2018 into MAID for mature minors by experts from the Canadian Council of Academies , but no changes were made to the age limit. Legislative changes in March 2021 broadened the eligibility for Canadians requesting and receiving the procedure to include those who don’t have a terminal condition, but the age cut-off remained. Canada’s government appointed a Special Joint Committee in 2021 to review issues surrounding the law and its application to mature minors , advance requests, mental illness, palliative care and the protection of people with disabilities. “The government of Canada has no immediate plans to alter the minimum age requirement to access MAID, though it will consider the advice of the Special Joint Committee on the matter of mature minors,” the health representative told AAP FactCheck in an email. People seeking medically assisted dying must be assessed by at least two health practitioners. Those seeking the procedure must satisfy stringent safeguard criteria including being aged at least 18 and be able to give informed consent at the time of request and immediately before MAID is provided. Candidates must also meet the criteria of having a grievous and irremediable medical condition defined by a serious illness, disease or disability. They must make a written request and be assessed by two independent health practitioners for eligibility. There is also a mandatory 10-day reflection period after the written request is signed, unless death or loss of capacity is imminent. For Canadians who don’t have a terminal condition , there is a mandatory 90-day assessment period by practitioners where all reasonable and available means to relieve suffering must be discussed and considered. The Facebook video claims Canada is normalising assisted dying among schoolchildren. Mr Wozny also makes false claims about a drug decriminalisation trial in British Columbia, saying it is legal, as of February 1, for people aged 16 and up to sell or distribute 2.5 grams of fentanyl, methamphetamine, heroin and crack cocaine (video mark 28min 10sec). Canada’s federal health agency granted British Columbia an exemption under the country’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a spate of overdose deaths since 2016.

            "claim [Claim]: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi routinely used a \"big fat 200-seat jet\" to travel between California and D.C.\n",
            "[Evidences]:An item about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi which was widely circulated online in November 2008 was a revised and recirculated version of a rumor that originally surfaced in February 2007 (just after Pelosi assumed the Speaker of the House position), claiming that Pelosi had spurned use of the Air Force C-20B Gulfstream III 12-seat jet that had been made available to her predecessor, Dennis Hastert, and instead demanded the use of a larger, more luxurious aircraft: Madame Pelosi wasn’t happy with the small private jet that comes with the Speaker’s job, no, Madame Pelosi was aggravated that this little jet had to stop to refuel, so she ordered a Big Fat 200 seat jet that could get her back to California without stopping! Many, many legislators walked by and grinned with glee as Joe informed everyone that Nancy’s Big Fat Jet costs us, the hard working American tax payers, thousands of gallons of fuel every week. Since she only works 3 days a week, this gas guzzling jet gets fueled and she flies home to California, cost to the taxpayers of about $60,000, one way!! As Joe put it, ‘Unfortunately we have to pay to bring her back on Monday night.’ Cost to us another $60,000. Folks, that is $480,000 per month and that is an annual cost to the taxpayers of $5,760,000!!! No wonder she complains about the cost of this war, it might cramp her style and she is styling, on my back and yours! I think of the military families in this country doing without and this woman, who heads up the most do-nothing Congress in the history of this country, keeps fueling that jet while doing nothing! Madame Pelosi wants you and I to conserve our carbon footprint?! She wants us to buy smaller cars and Obama wants us to get a bicycle pump and air up our tires!!! These people are nuts! After the 9/11 terrorists attacks in 2001, President George W. Bush ordered that the Speaker of the House (next in line of succession to the presidency after the vice-president) be afforded secure government transportation on military aircraft when traveling on official business, and then-speaker Dennis Hastert often used a C-20B (Gulfstream III) jet to travel back and forth between Washington to his home state of Illinois. The later brouhaha kicked off when Speaker Pelosi inquired about the availability and rules regarding the use of military aircraft other than the C-20B (such as the C-21 or the C-37A). Critics quickly maintained that Pelosi had insisted on being allowed to use a “big fat 200-seat jet” (a C-32 Boeing 757, which the Air Force describes as seating up to 45 passengers) so that she could travel in luxury and reward her financial contributors with lavish trips. Speaker Pelosi said that her inquiry involved security issues, primarily that she should have access, when needed, to an aircraft capable of flying non-stop between Washington and California, a quality the Air Force said was not possessed under all conditions by the C-20 aircraft used by her predecessor. Those security concerns prompted her to ask about the use of an aircraft that met the non-stop requirements, regardless of its size: Because the C-20 generally would need to stop and refuel to make it all the way to the Bay Area, Pelosi requested a plane that could make it to California without having to stop along the way. “I want an aircraft that will reach California,” Pelosi told reporters, insisting that she doesn’t care what kind of plane it is as long as it can fly nonstop to her home district. Pelosi and her aides said all she cares about is that the plane [be] able to fly direct to her home district in San Francisco without having to stop and refuel. Capt. Herb McConnell, the spokesman for the 89th Airlift wing at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, said the C-20 is sometimes “able to make a coast-to-coast flight at times during the year, but not when there are strong headwinds such as during the winter.” Republican leaders stated — with no tangible evidence — that Pelosi wants to use the plane to reward financial contributors. Pelosi’s office denied that she wanted anyone to be able to travel on the plane other than those Hastert was able to bring along — security, staff, family and members of Congress going to the same airport. “It has nothing to do with family and friends and everything to do with security,” Pelosi said. The sergeant at arms, she said, thinks “there is a need for this security. They have asked for it to continue. It is up to the Air Force and administration to do that.” Would Pelosi be willing to use a smaller plane as long as it could fly coast to coast? “Yes,” said a Pelosi aide. Ultimately it was the House sergeant at arms, Bill Livingood, who issued the request that, if necessary, the Speaker have access to a military plane meeting the non-stop security requirements — not specifically a “larger” plane or a C-32, but simply any suitable aircraft capable of making the California-Washington run non-stop — for travel to and from her home district: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not request a larger plane for personal use to travel cross-country without stopping, Bill Livingood, the House sergeant at arms, said. Livingood said the request was his, and he made it for security reasons. “The fact that Speaker Pelosi lives in California compelled me to request an aircraft that is capable of making non-stop flights for security purposes, unless such an aircraft is unavailable,” Livingood, who has been at his post for 11 years, said in a written statement. “I regret that an issue that is exclusively considered and decided in a security context has evolved into a political issue,” the statement said. The Los Angeles Times elaborated on the changes in air travel that the 9/11 terrorist attacks necessitated for the person holding the Speaker of the House position: For years, speakers flew commercial like everybody else in Congress. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, it was deemed that anyone two heartbeats away from the presidency warranted a military jet. Until now, the only speaker affected was Republican J. Dennis Hastert, who commuted to his Illinois district in small executive-style military jets. But those aircraft require ideal weather conditions to make the cross-country trip without stopping to refuel. The Bush White House also acknowledged that the request for use of a plane capable of non-stop flights was appropriate: “I have never asked for a larger plane,” Pelosi said. “This is a myth that they are talking about on the floor [of the House].” The White House also stood behind Pelosi. “As speaker of the House, she is entitled to military transport and … the proper arrangements are being made between the Sergeant of Arms Office in the House of Representatives and the U.S. Department of Defense,” White House spokesman Tony Snow said. “We think it’s appropriate,” he added. “And so, again, I think this is much ado about not a whole lot. It is important for the speaker to have this kind of protection and travel.” In the event, according to the Air Force, Speaker Pelosi did not routinely use the larger C-32 aircraft referenced in this rumor to travel between Washington and California (to the detriment of taxpayers’ wallets and the environment) every weekend, as claimed in the e-mail quoted above. According to the Air Force, as of the end of 2008 she had used that larger airplane on only one occasion, when no alternative was available: Eric Sharman, deputy chief of public affairs at Andrews Air Force Base, said that Pelosi has in the past used the C-20B and the slightly larger C-37A, depending on availability, and that these may or may not be able to make a nonstop cross-country flight depending on conditions. He confirms that Pelosi has used the C-32 once and only once, when no other planes were available. In March 2009, Judicial Watch published various e-mails and memoranda supposedly documenting Pelosi’s “repeated requests for military travel.” As ABC News noted of those documents: In fact, it appears that Pelosi uses military aircraft less often than her predecessor, former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. The documents cover the period from January 2007 to November 2008 and show that Pelosi made the equivalent of 20 round-trips between Washington (Andrews Air Force Base) and San Francisco. That’s an average of less than one round-trip per month. In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft. Like Hastert, Pelosi also occasionally leads Congressional delegations on foreign trips (the documents show six foreign trips: one to Asia, three to the Middle East and two to Europe). Moreover, the Air Force weekly travel reports reproduced in that Judicial Watch report disproved the claim made in the e-mail stated at the head of this article: They show Speaker Pelosi making 20 trips between Washington and California in 2007 and 2008, but always on the smaller C-20B and C-37A aircraft, never on the “big fat 200-seat” [sic] C-32 jet the e-mail claimed she used on a weekly basis. As well, an 11 January 2007 memo from a USAF Military Assistant to a Pelosi aide regarding refueling data provided additional confirmation that the C-20B could not always (depending upon weather conditions) make the trip from Washington to California without stopping to refuel: The typical flight time to San Francisco is 5+45 this time of year. The C-20 (Gulfstream III) has a max itinerary time of 5+30 (so this would need to stop for fuel heading west — depending on the winds). Travelling east, it should be able to make it back without fuel. For this weekend, the forecast is that winds heading to the west coast are very strong, thus likely forcing the C20B to stop for fuel tomorrow (generally, in the winter, the winds may prevent the C20B from making it nonstop to the west).\n",

            "claim [Claim]: The governor of Iowa chartered a flight to summarily return 124 undocumented children to Honduras.\n",
            "[Evidences]:The most common response to the question of why an Internet-circulated political item describes events “we haven’t heard about on the news” is because the referenced events didn’t take place. Such is the case with this rumor positing that Iowa governor Terry Branstad refused to allow 124 undocumented children to remain in his state and instead chartered a flight to return them all to Honduras. WHY HAVENT WE HEARD ABOUT THIS IN THE NEWS? YES! Obama just said “Up yours Iowa” and Iowa shoved it back… Governor of Iowa – Hurray for you, Governor announced that Iowa will not take any illegals kids (most teenagers) in IOWA. Obama overruled him and sent him 124 young kids 13-19, landed the plane in Des Moines. Airport manager called the office of the Governor Bransted [sic], he drove to the airport and chartered from Chicago a plane from United. Within 8 hours all the kids were loaded on, got food and drink. The plane left Iowa 8 o’clock Des Moines. Next stop was Honduras. Plane got unloaded, 4 social workers from Iowa made sure they got to the terminal, told the Honduras officials, here are your kids, they have no papers, you let them come illegal to America. Iowa refuses to take them. Iowa has their own laws. No minors who are not with adults. Iowa has not heard one thing from Washington. READ THIS!: American states are fed up. The genesis of this account was an influx of undocumented children (primarily those fleeing violence and worsening economic conditions in Central America) who were entering and remaining in the United States without satisfying any of the legal requirements for immigration. U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from immediately deporting such children if they come to the U.S. from countries other than Canada or Mexico; instead, the DHS is required to turn the youngsters over to the Department Health and Human Services within 72 hours. According to reports, however, most of these undocumented children were handed over to relatives or sponsors in the U.S., or simply released on their own recognizance, and were thereby illegally remaining in the U.S. rather than being sent back to their countries of origin: Unlike other stories of illegal immigration across a porous border, these immigrants aren’t sneaking in. They’re showing up and announcing themselves. “We are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily. And I mean hundreds at a time,” said Chris Cabrera, a leader of the local chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents. Many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender. “They know that once they get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the United States,” Cabrera says. “Most of the time, they’re getting released to relatives in the U.S.,” Cabrera said. “There’s nowhere to put them, so they’re released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date. I’d say between 95 and 97% of adults or youths don’t show up for court.” The numbers are staggering. He estimates that more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles will cross in 2014 and that the numbers will rise from there. “You’re talking kids from 17 years old, on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves,” Cabrera says. “The situation with the kids are they came by themselves, they have no relatives here, and the consulates can’t keep up. They’re in limbo. There’s no one (back home) to deport them to,” a DHS spokesman [said]. President Obama declared the issue to be “an urgent humanitarian situation”: President Barack Obama declared the crossings “an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response.” [I]n a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies, he announced an “interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation.” The group will oversee coordination with state, local and other agencies. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is establishing the group. In a statement, he said that “addressing the rising flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority of this administration and the Department of Homeland Security.” Nonetheless, U.S. border facilities didn’t have enough food, beds or sanitary facilities to provide for all the children entering the U.S., and critics took aim at the Obama administration and the federal government for not adequately addressing the situation — including Arizona governor Jan Brewer, who objected to busloads of immigrant children being transported to her state: Texas has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants, including minors, to Arizona. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer slammed the move. “Not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here,” she said in a statement. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, calls the situation “an administration-made disaster.” “Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama’s lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally,” he said in a statement. All of this background went into the example cited at the head of this page, a claim that Iowa governor Terry Branstad refused to allow 124 undocumented children to enter and/or remain in his state and instead chartered a commercial flight to return them to Honduras. That example is only true to the extent that Governor Branstad did indeed express opposition to housing such children in his state: Gov. Terry Branstad said that he does not want Iowa to host any of the thousands of children from Central America who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border alone. During a news conference, Branstad said he was not aware of any of the children currently living in Iowa and that state has not been contacted by the federal government about housing any immigrant children. He said the government’s focus should be on securing the borders. “The first thing we need to do is secure the border. I do have empathy for these kids,” Branstad said. “But I also don’t want to send the signal that (you) send your kids to America illegally. That’s not the right message.” However, the main thrust of this rumor was false because: According to local Des Moines press reports, the children referenced here were actually dispersed to the care of relatives throughout the state (or otherwise provided for) rather than being returned to their home countries: “We have a large influx of children,” but they are not arriving in Iowa in large groups, said Sonia Parras Konrad, a Des Moines lawyer who specializes in immigration law. She added, “They are going everywhere. I have clients from Waterloo, Hampton, Des Moines, Osceola, Ottumwa” and other Iowa communities. She views them as traumatized refugees who are escaping rape, murder and other horrendous problems in their native countries. Many of the children are being assisted by Central American relatives in Iowa who are impoverished, and they can use help from the faith community, nonprofit groups and others, Parras Konrad said. She sees a particular need for bilingual counseling and psychological help, along with volunteer legal services to assist the children. Connie Ryan Terrell, executive director of the Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, said an effort is underway to prepare Iowans for Central American children who don’t have a relative or friend they can be placed with. “The preference would be to find a way to provide and care for those kids in a homelike situation,” she added.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Fifty percent of our students who enter higher education need to take remedial courses because they are not prepared for college-level work.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:As floor debate on the Texas House’s version of the 2012-13 state budget wound down Sunday, state Rep. Donna Howard decried balancing the budget with spending cuts alone.The Austin Democrat, who voted against the bill, said lawmakers have falsely painted the state’s government as \"bloated,\" with enough revenue to run Texas.\"I have a hard time believing that when when 50 percent of our students who enter higher education need to take remedial courses because they are not prepared for college-level work,\" Howard said.We wondered whether half of the state’s 1.3 million students enrolled in higher ed really start off needing to catch up.To back up Howard’s statement, Eleanor D’Ambrosio, her chief of staff, passed on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the agency that oversees higher education in the state.But first, some background: As of fall 2003, state law requires students entering public higher education institutions in Texas to pass a Texas Success Initiative exam assessing their readiness in reading, mathematics and writing — unless they meet one of six exemption standards, including a combined verbal and math SAT score of 1,070, with a minimum of 500 on either portion of the test.Students must take and pass the exam before they’re eligible to enroll in college-level classes. Those who don’t pass one or all parts of the exam are placed in a \"developmental education program designed to help the student achieve college readiness,\" according to a June 2010 overview of the initiative by the coordinating board.According to an e-mail to Howard’s office from Lizette Montiel, a spokeswoman with the coordinating board, in fall 2008, 48.6 percent of students entering community colleges directly after graduating from high school failed to meet Texas Success Initiative standards in at least one area. The coordinating board collects the data from public institutions of higher education, the e-mail says.According to the e-mail, that rate has dropped from 54.3 percent in 2003.D’Ambrosio also sent us a link to a October 2008 column on the coordinating board’s website by Higher Education Commissioner Raymund Paredes. Paredes, arguing that some pre-Advanced Placement classes in Texas high schools aren’t rigorous enough, wrote that coordinating board data \"show that 50 percent of entering Texas college students require remedial education.\"She also passed on the agency’s strategic June 18 plan for fiscal years 2011-15. Addressing challenges Texas colleges may face in bringing under-prepared students up to college standards, the report says: \"Nearly half of all first-time college students are not college ready in at least one of the core academic areas of math, reading or writing.\"Case closed? Not quite.Board spokesman Dominic Chavez told us that in academic parlance, \"college\" refers solely to the state’s community colleges. Texas has more than 50 community college districts, some with multiple campuses. The board refers to four-year institutions as universities, Chavez said.Calling the June 2010 report \"a poorly-worded document,\" Chavez said those involved with higher education would catch that distinction, but there’s \"no way that someone from the general public would look at that and know that there’s a nuance there.\"Howard \"read exactly and said exactly what’s in the report,\" Chavez said. The report does not specify that \"college students\" only refers to people enrolled in community colleges.So, nearly half of all students who enroll in community college immediately after high school aren’t college-ready in at least one academic area, Chavez said, but that statistic changes when you include four-year universities. In fall 2008, 31 percent of students who enrolled in public higher education institutions — both community colleges and four-year universities— immediately after high school weren’t ready in at one academic area.The rate is even lower for students who enrolled in four-year universities right out of high school. Only about 14 percent of those students aren’t college-ready in one or more academic area.Include freshman university students who have been out of high school for longer, and the not-ready rate rises to about 28 percent. Add community college students who have been out of high school for a few years, and that figure jumps to 38 percent.\"Community colleges traditionally serve students who are less prepared,\" Chavez said. But \"most students who are enrolled in our universities are college-ready.\"Do all students who fail to meet the Texas Success Initiative standards in at least on area require remedial coursework? In most cases, yes, Chavez said.When we followed up with Howard’s office, D’Ambrosio told us that Howard was \"trying to convey (in her own words) a data point that had been presented to her\" by the coordinating board.\"Rep. Howard relies on state agencies to provide her with information and statistics on various topics,\" D’Ambrosio said. \"Rep. Howard did not ask for clarification when she was presented with information that said nearly half of all first-time college students are not college ready in at least one of the core academic areas of math, reading or writing.\"Upshot: Howard based her statement on a state report that says nearly 50 percent of all incoming college students fresh out of high school are underprepared for college and require remedial attention. However, the report doesn’t explain — and Howard didn’t realize — that the statistic excludes students at four-year universities.Taking into account all students who enroll in a Texas institution of higher education, nearly 40 percent aren’t prepared for some aspect of college-level work. And if you only look at students who enter higher education directly from high school, that rate drops to 31 percent. We rate Howard’s statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has offered a bill to ban bump fire stocks after police found 12 rifles equipped with these devices in the Las Vegas festival shooter’s hotel room. In a significant policy shift, Republicans and the National Rifle Association have said they believe that the government should intervene and regulate this kind of equipment, which allows semi-automatic weapons to fire over and over again without forcing the shooter to do all the work of squeezingthe trigger repeatedly. On Fox News Sunday, NRA-Institute for Legislative Action executive director Chris Cox drew a sharp line between his group’s stance and what he sees as the underlying Democratic agenda. \"I take Dianne Feinstein at her word when she says that if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America, turn in all of your guns,' they would do it,\" Cox told host Chris Wallace Oct. 8. Cox is off target, because he said Feinstein said she wanted to take away all guns. In reality, back in 1995, Feinstein said she wanted to take away all assault rifles. That’s a huge difference. While firm numbers are lacking, assault weapons represent a fraction of the country’s estimated total of 310 million guns. We reached out to the National Rifle Association and did not hear back, but Cox was repeating a charge that has been leveled against Feinstein before. In the past, it tracked back to an interview she did in 1995. Feinstein was a driving force behind the 1994 federal assault weapons ban. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. Those restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons made before the ban’s effective date Sept. 13, 1994. (Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004.) In a Feb. 5, 1995 segment on CBS News’ 60 Minutes, correspondent Lesley Stahl explored the surge in sales that preceded the ban. Stahl cited government estimates that as many 1.5 million weapons were in circulation due to the exception carved out in the law. Stahl said Feinstein told him in an interview that she didn’t want that, but had done the best that should could. \"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it,\" Feinstein told Stahl. \"I could not do that. The votes weren’t here.\" Feinstein repeated that message in a speech on the Senate floor a few months later: \"If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that. This is a moderate law.\" Her words have always applied to assault weapons, not all firearms. In a 2012 op-ed, she wrote \"Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right.\" And in proposing to ban bump stocks, Feinstein said her bill \"does not take anyone's gun.\" She also said she remains committed to some form of a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. Both the total number of firearms and assault-style weapons in the country remain unclear. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 2009, the country had about 310 million firearms: \"114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns.\" In 2013, pro-Second Amendment rights attorney David Hardy said in Senate testimony that nearly 9 million people went target shooting with an AR-15-style weapon. (AR-15 refersto one of the more common styles of the banned weapons.) Hardy used figures from the National Shooting Sports Foundation that showed in 2012 that only about a quarter of shooters owned an AR-style weapon. Based on that, 9 million would be a high-end estimate of the number of assault weapons owned in 2012. Set against a total number of firearms in excess of 300 million, assault weapons are not a large share of all guns. Cox said that Feinstein had once said \"if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America , turn in all of your guns,' they would do it.\" This is an inaccurate characterization of what Feinstein said in a 1995 interview on assault-type weapons. It is clear in context about loopholes in the 1994 assault weapon ban that Feinstein would have liked the ban to apply to all assault weapons but did not have the votes. That is a far cry from banning all firearms, and Feinstein has said she supports the right of people to own a weapon for hunting or self-defense. We rate this claim False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, \"got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things.\" \"This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up.\" We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28-- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far.(Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruz’s track record, and we looked at Clinton’s in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Paul’s legislative records using Congressional Quarterly’s BillTrack database and GovTrack’s advanced legislation search. We found that Bush’s statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senator’s impact in Congress. Put another way, it’s unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruz’s bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran’s chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubio’s bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support women’s rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18and Paul has four. The caveats to Bush’s claim So it’s true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul haven’t had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bush’s claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journal’s report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Who’s in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. It’s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members’ priorities are at the back of the line. \"First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority,\" Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruz’s record back in March. That said, the Senate’s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they’re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Paul’s efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party’s agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. \"That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference,\" Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn’t account for individual bills’ political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsor’s hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed.We also reached out to the campaigns forRubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clinton’s record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. There’s one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted. Our ruling Bush said that the three Republican senators running for president \"have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored.\" Bush has his numbers right: Of all the bills Cruz, Rubio and Paul have sponsored combined, only two bills have been signed into law. But experts told us that this isn’t a great measurement of a legislator’s effectiveness, and there are other ways to show impact in Congress. All three senators have their fingerprints on numerous laws as cosponsors or amendment authors. We rate Bush’s claim Mostly True. Editor's note: This post has been updated to include a response from the Cruz campaign that we received after publishing the article and to clarify the senators identified by Bush in his claim. \n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"We balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Newt Gingrich reiterated a talking point we several times have rated False. But this time, he tweaked the language. Responding to a comment from Rick Santorum about fiscal responsibility, Gingrich said, \"When we balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets, we doubled the size of the National Institutes of Health because we set priorities. It is possible to do the right things in the right order to make this a bigger, richer, more exciting country.\" We thought we’d see whether his new wording about the balanced budget was more accurate.Previously, we rated these statements by Gingrich:• \"When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets.\" (Republican presidential debate, Tampa, Jan. 23, 2012)• \"I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt.\" (Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Dec. 15, 2011)• \"For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt.\" (video announcement that he would run for president, May 11, 2011)All earned a rating of False because Gingrich was taking credit for two budgets that he had no role in assembling or shepherding through the House.As we explained in our earlier articles, Gingrich served as speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs.The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. While the federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- came when Gingrich was long gone from the House.In the Jacksonville debate, however, Gingrich modified his statement. This time, he said that the nation \"ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets.\" That is a more accurate way of putting it.His phrasing in Jacksonville was less boastful than some of his previous claims, such as the one in which he said, \"I balanced the budget for four straight years.\" In Jacksonville, he credited a piece of legislation passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic president.But he glossed over a pair of tax-raising bills that made a difference, and that Gingrich opposed, including the 1990 budget deal (in which President George H.W. Bush broke his \"no new taxes\" pledge), and the 1993 budget vote, which cost many Democratic lawmakers their seats in the 1994 Republican landslide.\"Like most things in life, what caused the budget to be balanced was multi-factorial, most important of which was the tech boom and the surging economy,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \"You can partially credit the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, but you could also credit the 1993 and 1990 bills that Speaker Gingrich opposed. It's a little too simple to say that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act ‘balanced the budget.’ \"In fact, when a pro-Gingrich super PAC claimed in an Iowa ad that \"Newt balanced the federal budget,\" we rated the statement Half True for this reason.\"The budget ended up balancing faster than either party expected simply because economic growth was so strong,\" Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us at the time. \"I don’t think either party had much to do with that.\"Stan Collender, a former Democratic staffer for the House and Senate budget committees, added that \"it happened on his watch, but it doesn’t mean that he gets credit for it. The only thing you can give him credit for is stalling some additional spending programs.\"Our rulingAt the Jacksonville debate, Gingrich was more accurate than he's been in the past and his chronology of the law and the four budgets is correct. But he oversimplifies the causes of the balanced budget. His words are accurate but need additional information, which makes this a Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47fe4a11-e312-476d-92c4-a6fb4d33a0e2\n",

            "[Evidences]:On Oct. 21, 2021, Halyna Hutchins, director of photography on the set of the movie “Rust,” was accidentally killed when actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun. In the wake of this tragedy, Donald Trump Jr. started to promote and sell shirts that read: “Guns don’t kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people.” This is a genuine product that was available for purchase on Don Jr.’s website, shopdonjr.com. The former U.S. president’s son has also promoted these items on Instagram. In one Instagram story, Trump Jr. wrote, “Get Yours Today [at] shopdonjr.com.” In another post, he shared a doctored image that supposedly showed Baldwin wearing one of these shirts: The death of Hutchins is currently under investigation. As of this writing, nobody has been arrested. While it’s possible that Baldwin will be held responsible in some fashion for Hutchins’ death (in addition to being an actor, he was also producing the film), a search warrant noted that Baldwin was told the gun didn’t have live rounds when he was handed the prop weapon. NBC News reported: Alec Baldwin didn’t know the prop gun he fired was loaded with live ammunition and neither did the assistant director who handed it to him before the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set Thursday, a search warrant document said. The assistant director yelled, “Cold gun,” before the shooting that killed Halyna Hutchins, 42, and wounded director Joel Souza, 48, on the set of “Rust” at Bonanza Creek Ranch, according to an affidavit filed in a Santa Fe court. The term “cold gun” is intended to indicate that the weapon did not have any live rounds, according to the document obtained by NBC affiliate KOB of Albuquerque and other news outlets. Baldwin, who portrayed former President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live” and appeared in campaigns to oppose the influence of the National Rifle Association, was also the subject of disinformation in the days after the incident as social media users shared fake newspaper clippings falsely claiming that he was ranting about Trump or acting erratically in the moments before the shooting.

            "[Evidences]:A WhatsApp message is being shared widely saying that PM Modi has announced a Helpline service- ‘1098’ that picks up the leftover food from functions, parties, homes etc., and feeds the hungry children. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in this WhatsApp forward message. The message that ‘Helpline-1098’ is meant to pick up food leftovers from functions, parties, homes etc., and are used in feeding the hungry children is doing rounds since the past many years and is again being shared on Facebook. The archived version of the post can be found here. Claim: PM Modi announced a Tele-helpline service ‘1098’ for picking up food leftovers from functions and parties. Fact: Helpline service ‘1098’ is a free Tele-helpline launched by CHILDLINE India Foundation(CIF) in 1996 to rescue the street children in distress. Hence the claims made in the message stand FALSE. The message that ‘Helpline-1098’ is meant to pick up food leftovers from functions, parties, homes etc., and are used in feeding the hungry children is doing rounds since the past many years. But actually, it is a free Tele-helpline launched by CHILDLINE India Foundation(CIF) in 1996 to rescue the street children in distress. Given the extent of spread of this fake message, the CIF has put a notice on its website “childlineindia.org.in” clarifying the public that its helpline is only meant to protect and take care of the street children in distress and have nothing to do with the collection of food leftovers. In the notice, it was mentioned as “chain mail circulating”, perhaps because this news might have been in circulation much before the entry of WhatsApp messaging application into India. To sum it up, ‘1098’ is not a Helpline to pick up the food leftovers, but a Helpline service for the street children in distress. Did you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)\n",

            "[Evidences]:Billions of dollars began pumping through the American economy in 2009 as part of the stimulus program started by President Barack Obama, but somehow Gov. Chris Christie missed that.While campaigning on Nov. 9 in New Hampshire for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Christie took to the airwaves and summed up in one word what the president did to spur job growth during the first half of his tenure: nothing.\"But remember this: (Obama) can complain about Republicans in the House as much as he wants,\" Christie said during an interview on the \"New Hampshire Today\" radio show. \"But in the first two years, he had, you know, huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America.\"Nothing was done to create jobs?Research by PolitiFact New Jersey shows that Christie’s statement ignores the impact of a major piece of federal legislation aimed at creating and saving jobs: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Signed into law less than a month into Obama’s presidency, the stimulus bill allocated about $787 billion in federal spending and tax benefits. By Sept. 30 of this year, about $5.5 billion had been awarded to recipients in New Jersey alone.According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and other independent economists, the stimulus bill has created or saved jobs. Funding recipients also have reported jobs supported by stimulus dollars.The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.Here’s what some of the economic research shows:Compared to what would have happened otherwise, the stimulus bill increased the number of people employed by between 1 million and 2.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, projected that without the stimulus bill, the country would have had 1.75 million fewer jobs as of the third quarter of 2011.\"The debate is how much, not whether it had a benefit,\" Zandi said.Daniel Wilson, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has estimated that stimulus spending created or saved 3.4 million jobs by March 2011.Ohio State University economics professor Bill Dupor offered another projection.Due to the stimulus bill, there were 870,000 private-sector jobs and 510,000 government jobs in place in December 2010, said Dupor, who made the analysis with University of Western Ontario economics professor Tim Conley.\"Thus, Tim and I are finding some jobs created/saved as a result of the ARRA,\" Dupor said in a series of emails. \"At this stage, Tim and I don’t have any projections based on plausible assumptions that say there was a net job loss.\"Another snapshot of the stimulus bill’s impact on jobs can be found at the government-run website -- recovery.gov -- which tracks jobs funded by stimulus dollars, as reported by certain recipients in each state.Between July 1 and Sept. 30, there were more than 6,300 full-time equivalent jobs in New Jersey funded by the stimulus in that quarter, according to the website.Our rulingIn a radio interview, Christie claimed that in Obama’s first two years, the president had \"huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America.\"But Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress did do something, governor. It’s called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a stimulus bill that various economists credit with creating or saving jobs.That’s why it is ridiculous for Christie to claim Obama did \"nothing.\" Pants on Fire!

            "[Evidences]:Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing.In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: \"Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. That’s right, one.\"We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests. In August 2012, we rated False a claim that Texas students spend 45 days a year on state-ordered exams after earlier rating Mostly False a claim about the number of testing days in the Austin schools.Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliff’s article does not say if he’s critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay State’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain \"proficient\" scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the state’s \"proficient\" score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the state’s high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.Now let’s flip to Finland.Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there \"are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students’ senior year in high school.\"The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exam’s purpose is to \"discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.\"According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.However, the exam is not a one-and-done. It’s composed of \"at least four tests,\" one that each student must take in his or her \"mother tongue\"—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the \"second national language\" or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.\"As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests,\" the web page says.Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students \"if they wish can take more exams.\" Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the country’s nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email.Our rulingRatliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one.Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation.But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliff’s article does not say he’s speaking only to tests administered in high school, it’s worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests.This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate.

While authorities announced plans to fly in hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccines and restrict the movement of cattle to slow the spread of the disease, there has been no prohibition on the consumption of meat or fish. Furthermore, lumpy skin disease cannot be transmitted from animals to humans, health authorities and experts said. \"Scientifically, this disease cannot be transmitted from animals to humans. Despite this, we have always recommended against the consumption of infected meat,\" the official from the Bureau of Disease Control and Vetenary Services told AFP. \"There are no reported deaths from the consumption of lumpy-skin infected livestock,\" the bureau added. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said in a field manual for veterinarians that \"lumpy skin disease does not affect humans\". AFP found no credible reports of people dying from infected meat.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A social media post erroneously suggested that there is a link between Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel’s Twitter activity and his stock trading. \"The CEO of Moderna deleted his Twitter and dumped $400 million of Moderna stock,\" a Feb. 15 Instagram post claimed, referring to the COVID-19 vaccine maker. \"Big Pharma seems to know some bad news is coming.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Bancel did delete his personal Twitter account (@sbancel) in February and has sold a substantial amount of Moderna stock in recent years, but the post ignores important context about the timing and circumstances of the sales, and leaves a misleading impression about the reasons behind them. Bancel, whose compensation has included salary and stock options, has been regularly selling Moderna shares since September 2019. Over the last two and a half years, he has sold about $400 million worth of company stock in regularly scheduled trades, according to a website that tracks trading by company insiders. The transactions are in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow company insiders to sell stock at predetermined dates. Doing so helps executives avoid any appearance or suspicion of illegal insider trading — that is, trading based on inside information that’s not available to the public. According to the February SEC filings, Bancel’s trading plan was adopted in December 2018, around the time the company went public, and was last modified in May 2020. So the post’s claim that he \"dumped\" $400 million in connection with some bad news is inaccurate. Bancel’s sales in February were in line with his trading plan. On Feb. 2, Bancel sold 19,000 shares of Moderna stock, worth $3.1 million, according to an SEC filing. A week later, on Feb. 9, Bancel sold another 19,000 shares, worth just under $3 million, per an SEC filing. The two transactions amounted to $6.1 million and represented only a small fraction of Bancel’s holdings. He still owns 21.8 million shares of Moderna stock, a company spokesperson told PolitiFact. Moderna’s stock price is well off its peak in August 2021, when it traded at nearly $500 a share. Its recent closing prices have been about a third of that. Bancel deleted his personal Twitter account earlier this month. It’s not clear why he did so, but Bancel was not very active on Twitter. His last tweets were from April 2019, according to a November 2021 archived version of his account. An Instagram post claimed, \"The CEO of Moderna deleted his Twitter and dumped $400 million of Moderna stock\" and suggested that the moves were due to impending bad news about the company. Bancel deleted his rarely used Twitter account, but there is no evidence to suggest that action is linked to his stock trades or bad news about the company. He did not \"dump\" $400 million of stock. His stock sales happened over more than two years, as part of a series of regularly scheduled trades. The most recent sales amounted to $6.1 million. He still owns 21.8 million shares of Moderna stock. We rate this claim Mostly False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says there is a \"traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:New Hampshire’s Sen. Maggie Hassan is the latest Senate Democrat to claim that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should be held to a 60 vote-standard in order to be confirmed. In a letter she wrote on March 28 explaining why she would vote against Gorsuch, Hassan referred to \"the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees.\" So is 60 votes the \"traditional\" magic number that Supreme Court nominees need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate? In reality, Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate. And superficially at least, the idea of a 60-vote threshold would seem to be contradicted by the experiences of Clarence Thomas, nominated in 1991 and confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006 and confirmed on a 58-42 vote. However, Senate procedure is complicated, leading to misunderstandings. So let’s walk through the process. How confirmation works First, a nominee must testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Gorsuch did last week. Once the committee passes the nomination -- and the Republican-led committee is expected to easily clear Gorsuch -- it goes to the full Senate. The process requires the Senate majority leader to take the chamber into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. There, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee, or in the case of an objection, would need to invoke cloture, the process to end debate and force a vote. Under a cloture vote, the Senate agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If Senate Democrats filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination, McConnell would need to invoke cloture. Today, there are 52 Republican senators, so under current rules, the Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them to reach the cloture threshold. That’s a difficult challenge in today’s polarized Congress. If there aren’t enough votes for cloture, McConnell could choose to \"go nuclear\" - that is, suspend the rules about how many votes Gorsuch would need to end the filibuster, changing it to a simple majority. (Here’s a more detailed discussion of the \"nuclear option.\") The 60-vote talking point Given the partisan combat over Gorsuch’s nomination, the \"60-vote threshold\" has become a widely repeated Democratic talking point. When we asked Hassan’s staff to clarify her statement about the \"traditional 60-vote threshold,\" they referred PolitiFact New Hampshire to a list of prior Supreme Court nominees, saying that every one confirmed to the Supreme Court since the Eisenhower administration except for two (Alito and Thomas) either received \"unanimous support or has met the sixty vote threshold.\" \"This is the traditional 60 vote threshold that Senator Hassan believes should be maintained,\" said Hassan’s spokeswoman Meira Bernstein. The problem for Democrats who make this argument is that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from \"traditional\" in Supreme Court nominations. In fact, it’s only happened four times in modern history, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker. The chamber voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006, and it did the same in 1968, 1971 and 1986. PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked skeptically on claims about the 60-vote standard, including comments by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Bernie Sanders I-Vt., referring to a requirement or a standard of 60 votes. Both of President Barack Obama’s nominees won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-31, and confirmed Elena Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010. However, while the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Hassan’s argument that confirmations require 60 votes, it’s not that simple. Those nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. Even though the margins were greater, the final confirmations required only 51 votes. Our ruling Hassan said that there is a \"traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees.\" Most Supreme Court nominees have indeed reached 60 votes. But not all have, and the official standard remains 50 percent plus one, not 60. And while a 60-vote supermajority for cloture is often required these days for much of the Senate’s business, filing for cloture is actually the exception, not the rule, where recent Supreme Court nominations are concerned. Cloture votes have been required in only four of the 23 confirmations since the Eisenhower Administration. This calls into question Hassan’s use of the term \"traditional.\" We rate the statement Mostly False.\n",

The claim is false; the photo has circulated since 2015 in media reports about a gunman detained in Kashmir. The photo was posted here on Twitter on December 7, 2021 by a user with more than 40,000 followers. It shows a man wearing a burqa alongside chyrons from what appears to be a news broadcast. The Urdu-language text on the image reads: \"The accused in the Sialkot tragedy, Imran Rizvi, caught while escaping from his sister's house in a burqa.\" The tweet's caption contains the same Urdu text and adds: \"Where did the Ashiqi go\". \"Ashiqi\" is a word sometimes used to describe people who are affectionate towards the Prophet Mohammed in Islam. Screenshot of the false post, taken on December 10, 2021. ( AFP / ) The post circulated online after a Sri Lankan factory manager was beaten to death and set ablaze by a mob in Pakistan who accused him of blasphemy. More than 100 people were arrested following the lynching, AFP reported on December 5, 2021. Comments from some users suggested they believed the claim about the image. One user commented: \"These are the religion's core believers, who run away wearing burqas like women and tell people to sacrifice themselves.\" Another user said the pictured man's \"unsuccessful escape\" proved that \"Islam doesn't approve of [his] actions.\" The photo was shared alongside a similar claim on Twitter here, here, here and here; on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Instagram here and here.

            "[Evidences]:A post is being widely shared on social media claiming that Madagascar President alleged that the World Health Organisation (WHO) offered him $20 million to put toxins in their coronavirus remedy. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Claim: WHO offered $20 million to Madagascar President to put toxins in their COVID-19 remedy. Fact: There is no evidence that Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina had accused WHO of offering him $20 million to poison their alleged COVID-19 remedy. A spokesman for the Madagascan presidency flatly has also denied the claims. Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina, in April 2020, launched a herbal concoction he claimed could prevent and cure the novel coronavirus, but it failed to halt COVID-19 spike in August 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When we searched for news articles regarding Madagascar’s President accusing WHO of bribing him, a BBC article titled ‘Coronavirus: The misinformation circulating in Africa about COVID-19’ was found. According to the article, the story first appeared in a French-language post on a Facebook account that was operating from Angola and DR Congo on 23 April 2020. The claims were later published by two newspapers in Tanzania on 14 May 2020, one of these reports alleges President Rajoelina had admitted during an interview with France24 that he had been offered money. Mr. Rajoelina was indeed interviewed by France24 on 11 May 2020, but at no point does he say he had been offered any money by the WHO. The WHO has said the BBC the story is fake, and the Madagascar government has dismissed the allegations. Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina, in April 2020, launched a herbal concoction he claims can prevent and cure the novel coronavirus. The drink which was developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA) is derived from artemisia- a plant with proven efficacy in Malaria treatment- and other indigenous herbs. However, the WHO has warned against “adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy” and in its statement, also welcomed innovations based on traditional remedies. Although the Madagascan leader is on record questioning WHO concerns about the herbal drink, there is no evidence he accused the agency of trying to bribe him to poison Covid-Organics, the herbal concoction. Later in August 2020 despite the spike in COVID-19 cases, President Andry Rajoelina stood by Covid-Organics, according to this BBC article. According to this article, Madagascar joined the COVID-19 vaccine COVAX program after initially not joining it. Several international fact-checkers have also debunked the claim made in social media posts that WHO was accused by Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina of offering $20 million in May 2020. The reports of which can be seen here, here, and here. To sum it up, Madagascar’s President did not accuse the WHO of offering $20 million to poison an alleged local COVID-19 treatment.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Claims: Two claims about the 50% increase in Communication Service Tax (CST) and allocations from revenue generated from the CST in 2020 Source: MP Samuel Nartey George Verdict: One true, one mixture [True: The primary claim(s) of the content are factually accurate.] [Mixture: The claim(s) of the content are a mix of accurate and inaccurate, or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete.] Researched by Rabiu Alhassan Ghana’s largest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) as part of efforts to hold the government accountable has been embarking on series of fora to present their position on several issues of national importance to Ghanaians. The seventh edition of the forum dubbed the “NDC’s moment of truth series” was addressed by Member of Parliament for the Ningo-Prampram constituency in the Greater Accra region, Samuel Nartey George. Speaking from the national headquarters of the NDC on December 12, Sam George who is also a member of Parliament’s Select Committee on Communications, pooh-poohed some policy initiatives of the current administration in the communications sector. Here is a fact-checked report on some of the MP’s claims. Claim: fifty percent (50%) increase in Communication Service Tax (CST) Verdict: True “We call for an immediate withdrawal of the 50% increase in the Communications Service Tax,” the statement read by Sam George and emailed to the media by the NDC said, noting that the increase is causing unbearable hardships on Ghanaians. But has the consumer tax truly been increased by 50%? Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta announced government’s intention to increase the Communication Service Tax to 9% from the initial 6% on Monday, July 29 when presenting the 2019 mid-year budget review statement to Parliament. In the mid-year budget, under the “2019 mid-year revenue measures” [page 28, paragraph 135, sub-section B], the minister said: “Government proposes to increase the tax [CST] to nine percent to develop the foundation for the creation of a viable technology ecosystem in the country.” Economist and President of CSO-New Era Africa, Bernard Owusu-Mensa in an interview with GhanaFact said, “this is obvious, the rise translates into a 50%increase.” Claim: GHS10 million out of the whopping GHS436, 540,000 to be collected from CST has been allocated to the Cyber Security Authority Verdict: Mixture “Only GHS10 million out of the whopping GHS436, 540,000 to be collected from CST has been allocated to the Cyber Security Authority,” the MP’s statement reveals. How accurate is this claim? Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta in the 2019 budget said “plans are far advanced to establish” a National Cyber Security Authority [page 152, paragraph 751], to protect all Critical National Information Infrastructure. This was further reiterated by the Minister of Communications, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful at the Ministry of Information, Meet the Press on December 13, 2018. About one year on, the 2020 budget is silent on the formation of the Authority while allocating 10 million to the Ministry of Communication for “Cyber security” [Appendix4A, page 218, Item 29]. According to the 2020 budget, GHS436, 540,000 is expected to be generated from the Communication Service Tax for the fiscal year [Appendiix 3A, page 214, taxes on domestic goods and services]. However, the budget does not state if the 10 million Ghana cedis allocated for cyber security is drawn from the CST revenue and a study of the 2019 CST Amendment (ACT 998) shows there is no specific provision regarding the use or purpose of the additional revenue to be generated as a result of the increase in the tax rate. “That must have been an error because we sent out my statement before I did the presentation. I ensured that in my oral submission the correction was made,” Member of Parliament Sam George stated in an interview with GhanaFact. In the video clip of the legislator’s presentation which was streamed live on Facebook by the “NDC National Communications Bureau” and has since been viewed 8,300 times, shared 113 times and had 77 comments, he said [between minutes 10:12-10:40]: “Only GHS10 million out of the whopping GHS436, 540,000 to be collected from CST has been allocated to the Cyber Security centre.” So, while the Member of Parliament was right about the revenue to be generated from CST. His claim that 10million cedis was to be drawn from the CST revenue and allocated to either the Cyber Security Center or the Cyber Security Authority is inaccurate, hence the rating mixture. CST was originally imposed by the government in 2008 for revenue generation and possibly to enhance its public acceptability, a fraction not exceeding 20% of revenue generated was to be dedicated to finance the National Youth Employment Programme (NYEP).\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A video shows a messy version of the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" that was performed at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).\n",
            "[Evidences]:In February 2021, as conservatives gathered in Orlando, Florida, for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed how the conference began with a messy rendition of the national anthem. The viral CPAC national anthem video features a split screen. On one side, there’s a singer. And on the other, we see a pianist rush to his seat and hurriedly prepare himself to play as a voice off camera can be heard saying “don’t screw this up.” The video on the right features a genuine video from CPAC. The video on the left does not. This rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” was performed by singer Sailor Sabol. While some on social media claimed that this singer is also Ted Cruz’s dog walker (a reference to a misleading claim about the Texas senator “abandoning” his dog when he traveled to Cancun, Mexico, during a severe winter storm), that is not the case. Others claimed that this performance took place just before former U.S. President Donald Trump took the stage. That is also untrue. According to CPAC’s schedule, this rendition of the national anthem took place on the first day of CPAC 2021. Trump spoke on the final day of the conference. An unaltered version of Sabol’s performance can be seen at the 20 minute mark of the following video: As you can see, this was an a capella version (sans piano accompaniment) of the national anthem. Sabol’s interpretation of “The Star-Spangled Banner” struck a sour chord with some social media users, who shared video of her rendition with various jokes and criticism. One person, for instance, claimed that this song was in the “key of Q” (a reference to the Qanon conspiracy theory.) As the criticism circulated, some musicians started posting videos of themselves playing along with Sabol. The viral video shared above comes from pianist Larry Goldings. Here’s a similar parody video from Kevon Carter: In short, a rendition of the national anthem performed at CPAC 2021 inspired some musicians to post mocking parodies. The singer’s performance was real; the accompaniments were not.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: “CDC reports, but media silent on truth about April 7 Wisc election” not causing a spike in COVID-19 cases.\n",
            "[Evidences]:A member of the Wisconsin Election Commission unhappy with perceived lack of proper COVID-19 media coverage took to Twitter to voice his frustrations. Dean Knudson, one of six commissioners who oversee the state election system, focused on a July 31, 2020, report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that confirmed a conclusion widely reported earlier — the mid-pandemic election of April 7, 2020, didn’t generate any spike in COVID-19 cases here. \"CDC reports, but media silent on truth about Apr 7 Wisc election: No lines at 99.9% polling places, over 70% absentee, no evidence in-person voting risky,\" Knudson’s tweeted on Aug. 3, 2020. He went on to link to coverage of the CDC study by the National Review. CDC reports, but media silent on truth about Apr 7 Wisc election: No lines at 99.9% polling places, over 70% absentee, no evidence in-person voting risky. Masks encouraged not mandated for Nov voting; request absentee ballot now at https://t.co/QnzrV5VWKF https://t.co/f6ZPLqCX5m https://t.co/VMx6XyEH8d Knudson — a former Republican lawmaker appointed to his post by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester — is voicing an allegation that’s become routine in all corners of the political universe: That his preferred viewpoint is being muzzled due to selective coverage by \"the media.\" Let’s check the tape. We’re focusing on Knudson’s claim about media coverage, but we’ll take a quick moment to examine what he says the media is missing. He highlighted three statistics that he said were in the CDC report, but the media was \"silent\" on. \"No lines at 99.9% of polling places\" — The CDC report only examined data from Milwaukee, and it didn’t make any reference to lines. Knudson said in an email he added this based on an assumption that there were no lines at any polling places outside of Milwaukee and Green Bay, where long lines generated extensive media coverage. He did not cite any survey or research actually establishing that no other locations had lines. \"Over 70% absentee\" — The CDC report, looking only at Milwaukee, noted 68% of Milwaukee votes were cast by absentee ballot. But Knudson’s tweet references Wisconsin, not Milwaukee. And the statewide rate of absentee voting was actually a bit higher at 74.4%, according to the election commission. The massive jump in ballots cast this way has been extensively covered. \"No evidence in-person voting risky\" — This is the lone element Knudson cites that is referenced in the CDC report, but his summary is not accurate. The report didn’t say in-person voting wasn’t \"risky\" — that’s a general statement that would apply to all in-person elections. The report simply looked at the data in the wake of the April 7 election and tentatively attributed the lack of impact to mitigation measures at polling locations. It said, \"No clear increase in cases, hospitalizations, or deaths was observed after the election, suggesting possible benefit of the mitigation strategies, which limited in-person voting and aimed to ensure safety of the polling sites open on election day.\" Now on to the media coverage. Knudson’s claim of no media coverage — first highlighted by Associated Press reporter Scott Bauer — hits a bit of a logical hurdle immediately since Knudson’s tweet included a link to a news account of the CDC report, but let’s assume he’s referring more to in-state media. The two-page CDC report labeled \"Notes from the Field\" wasn’t exactly breaking news. Media outlets in Wisconsin have been reporting for months that the COVID-19 trends after the election weren’t anywhere near a spike. Here’s a sampling: The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel headline on April 22, 2020, was, \"Two weeks after election, COVID-19 cases have not spiked in Wisconsin but experts urge caution about conclusions.\" A week later, the paper used a similar headline as more data became available: \"In-person voting didn't lead to spike in COVID-19, but concerns remain.\" The Associated Press took a similar approach May 6: \"No spike, but no certainty on fallout of Wisconsin election.\" And a Wisconsin State Journal headline on April 25 made the point as well: \"No bump in COVID-19 rates after Wisconsin's April 7 election, study says.\" The Journal Sentinel also noted in a May 11 story that a total of 71 people tested positive for COVID-19 after voting or working the polls April 7, according to the state Department of Health Services. It noted those cases accounted for less than 4% of the positive tests in the two weeks after the election. Meanwhile, PolitiFact Wisconsin posted a series of fact checks correcting errant claims of a surge. We rated a viral Facebook post False on April 21 that claimed a \"surge\" based on shoddy data work. We rated False a claim from state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, on April 24 when he said a jump in COVID-19 cases was due to the election (again due to poor data analysis). And we rated a viral video from One America News as Pants on Fire on May 12 when it asserted without offering evidence that \"The mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting.\" Knudson said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin he was most frustrated with the lack of coverage of the CDC report itself. As noted, numerous prior studies and reports had established the same thing months earlier, so the CDC finding wasn’t breaking any new ground. But it’s also worth noting that the report was released on a Friday, heading into a weekend where staffing across all media organizations drops dramatically. On Monday, several media outlets did cover the CDC report, including the Journal Sentinel, the State Journal and several TV stations, including Channel 3000 and WKOW in Madison. The Journal Sentinel story was posted about 45 minutes before Knudson’s tweet, while the others were posted later in the day. Knudson acknowledged he overlooked the Journal Sentinel story in a Twitter reply. Knudson said the media was \"silent on truth\" about the April 7 election, citing lack of coverage of a CDC report. But news organizations around the state have reported regularly on the COVID-19 trends after the April 7 election — including the lack of any spike attributable to the election. The CDC report wasn’t immediately covered by many outlets, but that’s explained in part by the timing of the report and in part by its lack of original findings. And the state’s largest news organization had written about the CDC report before Knudson tweeted. We rate this claim False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Jacob Zuma's government has done \"a good job of stabilising the economy and investing in infrastructure to propel the economy into the next phase of growth, while investing in improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable\".This is one of the central claims made by Jeff Radebe – the Minister in the Presidency responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation – in a lengthy article defending the president's performance. It followed an attempt by an opposition party to introduce a motion of no confidence against Zuma.Radebe listed a number of achievements he attributed to the Zuma and the government. “This is not a political stunt,\" he wrote, \"this is no fiction; this is reality.\"Are his statements based on reality? Africa Check assessed them.(Note: Radebe’s office failed to respond to several requests for the source material on which he based his claims. A government spokesperson, Phumla Williams, also ignored calls and text messages. We have evaluated the claims by drawing on publicly available data and information.)VotingClaim “In 2014, more than 62% of South Africans made their democratic choice to choose a political party of their choice.” Verdict incorrectEconomic growthClaim “By the fourth quarter of 2014, GDP showed signs of recovery at a 4.1%. What is important, though, is that the real sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, were positive and actually grew.” Verdict misleadingEmploymentClaim “Whilst jobs were lost [due to the recession], in 2014 South Africa has actually managed to employ even more people than were employed in the years when jobs were lost, implying that there is recovery.” Verdict misleadingRenewable energyClaim “Under the stewardship of President Zuma, South Africa has one of the largest renewable energy programmes ranked among the top 10 in the world.” Verdict incorrectElectricityClaim “The percentage of households connected to the electricity mains increased from 82% to 85%.” Verdict correctWaterClaim “The percentage of households connected to piped water increased from 88% to 90%.” Verdict mostly-correctSanitationClaim “The percentage of households with access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 70% to 78%.” Verdict mostly-correctEducationClaim “The percentage of persons aged 20 years and above with no formal education or highest level of education less than Grade 7 within each gender group decreased from 19.3% to 16.2%.” Verdict correctLife expectancyClaim “South Africans now live nine years longer than they did in 2005 due to the roll-out by this government of drugs that prolong life.” Verdict correctStudent aidClaim “[The] National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) increased from R2.4 billion in 2008 to R9.5 billion in 2014.” Verdict mostly-correctPovertyClaim “South Africans benefit from a cocktail of social assistance programmes and services that alleviate poverty and indeed poverty has visibly been reduced since 2000.” Verdict correctState spendingClaim “South Africans have continued to trust government with their taxes. South Africa’s budget in 1994 was R135.1-billion; by 2004 this had doubled to R370-billion and R834-billion in 2009. The Minister of Finance recently announced a budget of R1.3-trillion. This means that since 2009 we have added more than the equivalent of the entire budget of 2004 and seen a 1,000% increase since 1994.” Verdict incorrectSouth Africa had a population of around 54-million people in 2014. According to the Independent Electoral Commission , an estimated 31.4-million people were eligible to vote in 2014 but only about 18.4-million people turned up to vote. The ANC garnered 11.4-million votes This means that 21% of all South Africans, or 36% of all eligible voters, voted for the ANC. Sixty two percent of all valid votes cast were for the African National Congress.Radebe is right on the numbers, but the financial quarter he chose to highlight paints a much brighter economic picture than is actually the case.The deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Francois Groepe, made the distinction in a recent address : “Although the South African economy expanded at a brisk annualised rate of 4.1% in the final quarter of 2014, growth for the full year was a disappointing 1.5% and represents the second-lowest growth rate recorded over the past sixteen years.” If you look at 2014 as a whole , the mining sector actually contracted by 1.6%, while the manufacturing industry showed no growth. Agriculture did increase by 5.6% percent.Radebe’s claim only deals with absolute labour statistics, that is, the actual number of people employed. In the fourth quarter of 2008 there were approximately 14.7-million people employed in the South African economy. By the third quarter of 2010 1.1-million jobs had been lost.Since then employment has increased. The most recent employment statistics show that 15.3-million people were employed in the fourth quarter of 2014 However, Radebe’s claim is misleading in that the unemployment rate has not recovered to pre-recession levels. Ratios are a better measure than absolute figures, the executive manager of labour statistics at Stats SA, Peter Buwembo, has told Africa Check.Prior to the recession the narrow unemployment rate was 21.5%. The latest statistics show the unemployment rate was 24.3% at the end of 2014.According to Kadri Nassiep, CEO of the state-owned South African National Energy Development Institute , “countries such as China, US and Germany still lead the way in total installed capacity”.He added that South Africa falls in the top 5 countries when the size of its renewable energy investment is compared to GDP. Uruguay, Mauritius and Costa Rica topped this ranking in the 2014 Global Status Report, compiled by international renewable network REN21.South Africa did make the top 10 list for investment in renewable energy in 2012 and 2013. The two most recent reports by Bloomberg New Energy Finance stated that South Africa invested $5.7-billion in renewable energy in 2012 and $4.9-billion in 2013 China was head and shoulders above the rest: investing $64.7-billion and $54.2-billion in those years. It already has an installed renewable energy capacity of 378GW , whereas South Africa aims for 6.7GW by 2016 and 17.8GW by 2030 The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of households connect to electricity mains increased from 82.7% in 2009 to 85.4% in 2013. The statistics for 2014 will be released around the middle of this year.The 2013 General Household Survey revealed that 89.9% of households had access to piped water, up from 89% when Zuma took office. Just over 4% of households had to fetch water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools and dams, wells and springs.But this one statistic does not provide the full picture about access to water in South Africa. In 2013 a quarter of households reported interruptions to their water supply that lasted more than 2 days at a time or lasted more than 15 days in total.Households also reported problems with the quality of water they received. In 2013 7.4% households (1.1-million) felt that their water was not safe to drink, 7.9% that their water was not clear, 8.8% that their water did not taste good whereas just over a million households (6.9%) felt that their water was not free from bad smells.The 2013 General Household Survey showed that access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 72.4% of households in 2009 to 77.9% of households in 2013. RDP standard sanitation includes flush toilets (either connected to a public sewerage system or a septic tank) or a pit toilet with a ventilation pipe.In 2013 62% percent of households had access to a flush toilet connected to either the public sewerage system or a septic tank. 15% has access to a pit latrine with a ventilation pipe and 16% has access to a pit latrine without a ventilation pipe.Four percent of households reported that they did not have access to sanitation of any kind. The survey noted that “the percentage of households that continued to live without proper sanitation facilities had been declining consistently between 2002 and 2013”.However, the general secretary of the Cape Town based Social Justice Coalition, Phumeza Mlungwana, told Africa Check that Radebe’s numbers lacked important context.“The claim doesn’t say anything about the condition of the toilet or the experience of using it or whether the toilet is functional and clean,” she said.For the first time, the 2013 General Household Survey included questions about problems experienced by households that share sanitation facilities. Statistics provided by Stats SA showed that 3,209,048 households (22.4%) reported sharing toilets facilities.The main problems these households experienced included poor hygiene (25.6%), poor lighting (25.1%), concern about physical safety while using the toilets (22%) and finding the toilet pit or chamber full (21.8%).The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of people aged 20 years and older who had no education, or had completed some primary school below grade 7, had decreased from 19.3% in 2009 to 16.2% in 2013.Radebe’s claim is supported by Stats SA’s 2014 mid-year population estimates . It showed that life expectancy increased by 9.1 years from 52.1 in 2005 to 61.2 years in 2014.Deputy executive director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute , Francois Venter, told Africa Check that the general consensus was that life expectancy in South Africa had been driven up by the rollout of antiretroviral therapy.“If you stop someone from dying in their 20s, 30s and 40s with ARVs, you bump up the average age at death significantly,” he said.“It is possible other things contributed – fresh water, less under-nutrition, expanded vaccine programmes – but that doesn’t cause such a dramatic change.”The National Student Financial Aid Scheme’s annual reports show that they provided funding worth R2.5-billion in 2008/09 A spokesman for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, Kagisho Mamabolo, told Africa Check that R9.2-billion worth of funding was provided in 2014. However, this excluded an additional R1-billion which was provided by the Department of Higher Education and Training to cover funding shortfalls in 2013 and 2014.The scheme provides funding to students that qualify according to a financial means test . Students are required to start repaying their loans once they start earning a salary of R30,000 or more per year, at an initial rate of 3% of their annual salary.Both students and universities have raised concerns that there is not enough funding to assist financially needy students. Earlier this year Wits University’s Student Representative Council was reported to have raised R2-million to assist students that did not receive funding from the scheme.Research by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit at the University of Cape Town, among others, showed that poverty as measured by income declined slightly between 1993 and 2012.To a large degree, the decline could be attributed to state spending on social grants, said Lauren Royston, director of research and capacity at the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI).Another tool whereby poverty can be measured showed an even greater reduction over this period . The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) takes into account more than income. It scores nine factors, such as school enrolment, nutritional levels and access to basic services that include electricity, sanitation and water.However, the index suffers from two limitations, former SERI researcher Michael Clark pointed out. First, it relies heavily on government statistics. The index also does not measure the quality of basic services.Despite the decrease achieved, Royston said South Africans must be mindful that poverty remains deep and widespread and that inequality has increased This claim is a bit nonsensical as it neither proves nor confirms anything, said the head of Wits University’s School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw. “One, we are compelled to pay taxes and two, to judge the budget in nominal terms doesn’t tell us much.”Rossouw said a more useful metric is to compare the budget with the gross national product (GDP) in a particular year. South Africa’s budget comprised 28.9% of GDP in the 1992/93 financial year , the highest this ratio was from 1993 to 2012. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12 it averaged 27.2%. In 2013 the ratio reached 33.2% There is a cause for concern when state expenditure grows faster than the economy, said Rossouw, as he has pointed out as co-author of a journal article before . However, state expenditure slowed in the fourth quarter of last year , giving some credence to the state’s promise to curb spending.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Following Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ executive order to move into Phase 3 of reopening the state on Friday, there was some confusion on social media about how far-reaching the order actually is. Several viral Facebook posts suggested that the order means masks are no longer required anywhere in Florida and that restaurants, bars, and other businesses are now open at full capacity. Such claims are largely accurate, though with a few caveats that the posts left out. DeSantis’ order both allows for businesses and restaurants to reopen at full capacity and for local ordinances to continue to limit capacity if local governments decide doing so is necessary. However, according to the order, no local ordinance can prevent any business from operating at less than 50 percent capacity, and in instances where such ordinances prevent a full reopening, the local government must “quantify the economic impact of each limitation or requirement on those restaurants” and “explain why each limitation or requirement is necessary for public health.” The order also suspends penalties for individuals not abiding by mask mandates. While it effectively nullifies any mask orders from local governments, such mandates can still, technically, be in place. Orange County, for example, instituted a mask mandate without an accompanying penalty, meaning DeSantis’ executive order does not affect the status of the county’s ordinance. Furthermore, the state order applies only to individuals, meaning, as City of Tampa spokesperson Ashley Bauman noted in an interview with the local Fox affiliate, that fines and penalties levied against noncompliant businesses still remain. Tampa’s city government mandates businesses to require “all persons within the location to wear a face covering when not maintaining social distancing.” It also requires businesses to deny entry to anyone without a mask and to remove anyone who doesn’t comply with the order. Businesses throughout the state are still within their rights to require customers to wear masks. Disney has already said it will continue to require face masks.\n",

Quoting from a Brookings Institution proposal called \"College Grants on a Postcard,\" the former first lady said something must be done given how long Americans spend filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid each year. It's 100-million hours, Clinton said, the equivalent of 55,500 full-time jobs. Her math is slightly off, and it relies on a disputed number. The Brookings Institution paper says 100-million hours is \"the equivalent of about 50,000 full-time jobs.\" And our calculator figures it's 48,077 jobs of 40 hours a week. Also, that figure of 100-million hours is at odds with the government's best estimate. The Department of Education estimates on its Web site that first-time users will need less than an hour to complete FAFSA on the Web. That time frame \"largely assumes that the applicants and their parents come to the Web prepared,\" spokeswoman Stephanie Babyak told PolitiFact.com. Approximately 10-million forms are filed each year. By the department's estimate, it would be 10-million hours of form filling. \"Implausible,\" counters Harvard University associate professor Susan Dynarski, who wrote the Brookings Institution paper. \"The IRS estimates 8 to 10 hours to complete the 1040EZ or 1040A, which are both far shorter than the FAFSA,\" Dynarski wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact.com. \"The estimate for the 1040 is 16 hours, and 1040 is about the length of the FAFSA. Other researchers have estimated an average of 27 hours for IRS compliance. Ten hours is therefore an informed estimate based on this range of values and our detailed examination of the FAFSA questions.\" Given such disparities, we turned to other experts, who largely sided with the Department of Education's version. \"That form is fairly simple,\" said Vivian Fiallo, a guidance counselor at Freedom High in Tampa. Several of the questions are biographical — nothing tough there — and many require only a yes or no. The interactive Web site even tells you where to look for each answer, Fiallo added. Indeed, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire-based Center for College Planning said in an e-mail that the denseness of the form has become less of an issue since it went online, though some families still describe the process of applying as overwhelming. \"With assistance, it can take an average of 30 to 45 minutes to fill out the FAFSA,\" the center's Erin Hathaway wrote to PolitiFact.com. \"If there are complicated asset situations or private business owners, joint families etc., then it can take longer, usually one to two hours.\" No research has been done on the topic, said Meihua Zhai, director of research at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, making all information on how long it takes anecdotal. Given the disputed number and the lack of research, we find Clinton's statement to be Half True. \n",

            "claim [Claim]: In a 1983 interview with MTV, David Bowie asked a host why the television music channel did not feature more work by Black artists.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Jan. 10, 2021, marks the five-year anniversary of the death of singer and musician David Bowie. Many online began marking his death by reliving important moments from his decades-long career, particularly when Bowie spoke up against racial inequality in the music industry. Around the time of his death in 2016, MTV shared a 1983 interview clip between Bowie and one of its VJs (video jockeys), Mark Goodman, in which Bowie takes the television channel to task for not featuring enough Black artists. The interview went viral again in January 2021. The full interview is available on MTV’s official YouTube channel, but MTV also shared the moment that went viral: At the time, the television station was only two years old. After an interview about his work and persona, Bowie wanted to ask Goodman a question of his own, about MTV not playing enough videos of Black artists: Bowie: Having watched MTV over the past few months, it’s a solid enterprise with a lot going for it. I’m just floored that by the fact that there’s so few Black artists featured on it. Why is that?Goodman: I think we’re trying to move in that direction. We want to play artists that seem to be doing music that fits into what we want to play on MTV. The company is thinking in terms of narrow-casting.Bowie: That’s evident […] The only few Black artists one does see are on about 2:30 in the morning until 6:00. Very few are featured prominently during the day. I’ll say that over the last couple of weeks things have been changing, but it’s been a slow process. A transcript of key moments of the conversation is reproduced below: Goodman: It’s funny, I think people have different perceptions. When you wind up watching — let’s say you watch an hour or two or even three a day, people somehow come away with different ideas about what we are doing. We don’t have any kind of day-parting for anything, let alone for Black artists, day-parted out of what would be “prime time.” We don’t have that.Bowie: Because one sees a lot on — there’s one Black station on television that I keep picking up. I’m not sure which station it’s on. But there seem to be a lot of Black artists making very good videos that I’m surprised aren’t used on MTV.Goodman: Of course, also, we have to try and do what we think not only New York and Los Angeles will appreciate, but also Poughkeepsie or Midwest — pick some town in the Midwest — that would be scared to death by Prince, which we’re playing, or a string of other Black faces and Black music.Bowie: That’s very interesting. Isn’t that interesting?Goodman: We have to play the music that we think an entire country is going to like. And certainly we are a rock ‘n’ roll station. Now, the question would be asked, should, since we’re in New York, should [W]PLJ play, you know, the Isley Brothers. Well, you and I might say, well, yeah, because we’ve grown up in an era when the Isley Brothers mean something to me. And so do the Spinners way after the Isley Brothers. But what does it mean to a 17-year-old? Well, when you talk on the phone to these guys like I did when I was in radio, it’s scary.Bowie: Well, I tell you what it means. I tell you what maybe the Isley Brothers or Marvin Gaye means to a Black 17-year-old. Surely he’s part of America as well.[…]Goodman: Well, what I’m saying, though, is that there’s, as you say, there certainly are a lot of Black kids and white kids who may want to see Black music, but there’s a ton of them who are — it’s not like it was in ’67 where you say, “Yeah, I’m not into that, but you are? Yeah?” Now it’s, “You’re into that? I don’t like YOU.” And that’s scary, and we can’t just turn around and go, “Well, look, this is the right way!” We can only teach, I think, a little bit at a time.Bowie: Interesting. OK, thank you very much.Goodman: Does that make sense? Is it a valid point?Bowie: [Smiling] I understand your point of view. [Laughs] By the end of the interview Bowie, who would later be married to Somali model Iman, did not seem entirely satisfied by Goodman’s responses. Given that the interview was released on MTV’s official YouTube channel, we rate this claim as “True.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Barack Obama went on comedian Jon Stewart's \"The Daily Show\" on Oct. 27, 2010, to make his case to younger voters.Stewart was a tough questioner of the president, saying that despite a campaign that promised audacious change, \"legislatively, it has felt timid at times.\"Obama said he disagreed with that, adding, \"We've done things that some folks don't even know about.\"\"What have you done that we don't know about? Are you planning a surprise party for us? Filled with jobs and health care?\" Stewart asked.Obama then listed a string of accomplishments, including this one: \"Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn't have it before, through the Children's Health Insurance Program.\"You might not remember it, but an expansion to the state Children's Health Insurance Program became law very early in Obama's presidency. The program provides insurance to children in families who aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance.President George W. Bush had vetoed the legislation twice in 2007, on the grounds that it increased tobacco taxes and would expand government-run health insurance programs to the middle class. Obama signed the law on Feb. 9, 2009.Now, what about the 4 million kids? Was it really that many?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated in 2007 that the law would expand eligibility to 3.8 million children but that would be after the new law had been in place four years. Obama's bill has been in place just under two years, so it likely hasn't increased by that much. Because the program is administered by the states, the most recently available national enrollment figures on the program are from June 2009. They show, as we would expect, only a modest increase in the program's enrollment.In ruling on our statement, Obama is correct to claim credit for signing the Children's Health Insurance Program into law after Bush had vetoed it. But he was exaggerating by using the 4 million estimate prematurely. It will take awhile for the program to reach its projected enrollment. So we rate his statement Half True.\n",

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story provides no evidence and repeats the same story posted by the satirical fake news website Reagan was Right, adding in a screenshot of Fox News’ Lou Dobbs. Several fake stories during the past couple of years have alleged voter fraud to the benefit of Democrats or involving undocumented immigrants following an election cycle in which Donald Trump repeatedly made ridiculous statements about voter fraud. After being sworn into office, Trump continued to falsely claim substantial evidence of voter fraud. Voter fraud does happen, but not to the widespread amount that Trump has alleged. The Politico News story said that voting machines in 11 states have been declared \"compromised\" as a result of a software glitch — and as a result, the story says, \"17 elections involving ballot referendums for free entitlements for immigrants, legalized marijuana and decriminalizing heroin overdoses should be overturned.\" The story said that the company that owns the machines, Novus Ordo Seclorum, INC, is owned by a group of Democrats including George Soros, Chelsea Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, and the estate of John Kennedy. According to LinkedIn, Novus Ordo Seclorum was a Delaware consulting firm formed in 2010 to help identify strengths and weaknesses in businesses. Its profile makes no mention of voting machines. It’s unclear if the company still exists; the website was a dead link and the voicemail for the phone number was full. Not surprisingly for a made-up story, we found no evidence that the company is owned by the high-profile Democrats it mentioned.

            "[Evidences]:A post on Facebook makes a number of claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, centring on the assertion that Covid-19 tests do not test for Covid-19 specifically, but any coronavirus, including ones which cause \"nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms\". (Some coronaviruses cause what we know of as the common cold.) This is false. As we have written about extensively here , the diagnostic test used in the UK is called a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, which looks for the virus's genetic material to see if someone currently has Covid-19. The Facebook post questions the reliability of PCR tests and there is something in this. PCR tests can sometimes indicate that someone does not have the virus when they do (false negative). They can also indicate that someone has the virus when they don't (false positive). It's hard to say how many false negatives and positives PCR tests produce, but in general, these tests are \"highly accurate \". Most importantly, what a PCR test won't do is misinterpret the presence of other coronaviruses as the presence of the virus which causes Covid-19, as this post claims. The possibility that a test might pick up related viruses that have genetic similarities to the virus you're looking for (technically known as \"cross-reactivity\") is something that is looked at when designing PCR tests. For example, one of the earliest PCR testing protocols , which was published on 13 January, specifically checked that the test did not pick up the four human coronaviruses that cause infections including the common cold. Results for a range of available PCR tests show that they do not cross-react with any viruses analysed, including other coronaviruses. Where some of the confusion might have come about is because of the accuracy of antibody tests. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says : \"There is a chance that a positive result means you have antibodies from an infection with a different virus from the same family of viruses.\"\n",

The claim appeared as a video (archived here) where it was published by Cancel Fake News on Facebook on January 6, 2021, under the title \"Antifa dressing up as Trump supporters in the Crypt.\" This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Thu Jan 7 19:13:48 2021 UTC) The 11-second video clip shows protesters fighting with law enforcement officers on the ground floor of the Capitol building, in the rotunda referred to as the \"the crypt.\" The Facebook page that posted the video with the headline \"Antifa dressing up as Trump supporters in the Crypt,\" describes itself as: Cancel Fake News exposes the corporate media for being totally fake and phony. We also dig through leftwing propaganda for real news. Our page is run by War Room operatives that believe in the America First agenda. There is no evidence provided that those shown in the video were antifa activists. Antifa is a term used to describe a wide variety of both loosely affiliated and independent antifascist organizations whose anti-racist and anti-fascist credos date back to the resistance to the 1920s rise of Italian fascism under Benito Mussolini and the 1930s rise of Nazism in Germany under Adolph Hitler. As Lead Stories reported shortly after pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol, the man shown in multiple photos wearing a Viking-style helmet and a fur coat, with a tattoo on his chest, is a well-known QAnon supporter who has been identified as Jake Angeli. Nicknamed \"QAnon Shaman\" for his face paint, bare chest, and tattoos, Angeli has given interviews to the press about his support of President Trump. He is not an antifascist activist and he told an Arizona Central reporter in May 2020 that he was a Trump supporter. I'm seeing false tweets that Jake Angeli (aka \"QAnon Shaman\") who was part of the group that stormed the Capitol and made it into the chamber, is Antifa. He is very much a @realDonaldTrump and QAnon supporter, per my interview with him last year 👇@azcentral https://t.co/S8luSxeHiO -- BrieAnna J. Frank 🌵 (@brieannafrank) January 6, 2021 National news outlets reported on the protesters that stormed the Capitol as being Trump supporters and QAnon activists, not antifa activists.

            "claim [Claim]: \"In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The head of Rhode Island's largest homeless shelter argued in a Nov. 12, 2014 Providence Journal commentary that the costs of not finding someone a home can be very high. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, reported that, \"In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person, which is far higher than the typical $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults on Medicaid and $9,240 per person per year for the average Medicaid recipient.\" That's a huge difference. We were curious about whether those numbers were accurate and why the gap was so large. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government health-care program for the very poor. Nolan’s commentary referenced the 2013 \"Rhode Island Annual Medicaid Expenditure Report,\" developed by the state's office of Health and Human Services. We located the report, but we couldn't find any numbers that matched Nolan’s. So we emailed her to make sure that was really her source. She replied that the information actually came from a June 1, 2014, report by Providence College sociologist Eric Hirsch, in which he identified 5,986 Rhode Islanders who had spent at least one night in an emergency shelter over a 28-month period and discovered that 2,308 were covered by Medicaid. Their Medicaid expenses totaled $58 million. Hirsch doesn't calculate the cost per person, so we did. It's $10,795 per person per year. That's pretty close to the average for all Medicaid recipients and a far cry from $60,000. So where did Nolan get her $60,000 figure? In his report, Hirsch wanted to make the point that those costs were not evenly distributed among the homeless. \"In fact,\" he wrote, \"the 67 individuals who were homeless for one year or more and had the highest Medicaid bills had total charges of $9,325,375.\" That's $139,185 per person for these 67 people\" over 28 months. \"The corresponding annual charge was just under $60,000 per person,\" Hirsch wrote. But we immediately noticed a problem -- $60,000 isn't the average for all long-term homeless people. It's only for the 67 people who racked up the highest Medicaid bills, a distinction Nolan didn't make in her commentary. When we contacted Hirsch, he explained that, \"We do want to be able to argue that it would be most cost effective to house the most vulnerable.\" In other words, finding housing for 'high cost' homeless are going to save the most money. He said he used an arbitrary cutoff -- expenses of $47,000 or more -- to identify the high-cost users. Because Nolan was talking about all long-term homeless on Medicaid -- not just the 67 with the highest bills -- we asked Hirsh for the information on the larger group. He went back to his data and reported to us that there were 442 long-term homeless people who had, on average, $23,650 in Medicaid charges per person per year. Although that's double the amount for the typical person who was homeless for at least one night, it's dramatically less than $60,000. When we wrote back to Nolan asking if she was aware that the $60,000 figure only applied to homeless Medicaid patients with the biggest bills, she said she had misinterpreted the report. Finally, for the record, Hirsch and Nolan erred when they said the average Medicaid cost is $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults. As Hirsch reported when we questioned the figure based on the state Medicaid report, the correct amount is $21,696. Our ruling Anne Nolan said Rhode Islanders who have been homeless for at least a year cost Medicaid an average of $60,000 per person per year. But the $60,000 cost she cites applied only to the 67 homeless people with the highest medical bills, a major caveat she didn't mention in her commentary. The annual dollar amount for all Medicaid recipients in the study who were homeless for at least a year was $23,650 -- a substantial cost to taxpayers, but far less than what Nolan indicated. Because Nolan's statement makes it sound like it applies to all long-term homeless people on Medicaid when, in fact, it only focuses on the most-expensive subset, we rate it False.

            "claim [Claim]: Four black players sent the NFL an \"ultimatum\" that included demands that the league force \"white fans\" into community activism.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Amid an ongoing public debate over protests by National Football League players over social and racial injustice, a report emerged in October 2017 that four black players had given the league a “sick ultimatum,” in an effort to “force white fans” to engage in community activism. On 22 October 2017, the Freedom Daily web site published an article claiming: …Unfortunately, [Seattle Seahawks’ Michael] Bennnett isn’t stopping their [sic] with his outlandish racism. He’s now demanding that all fans and the NFL comply with his anti-American and anti-cop views, with thewith the ridiculous ultimatum he gave to the NFL this week. Similarly to how the NFL dedicates an entire month to breast cancer awareness, Bennett, along with several other protestingathletes want the entire month of November to be officially recognized by the NFL’s as a month to protest America’s police officers, and thethe “oppression” that blacks feel with living in in our country. The article is centered around a memo reportedly sent to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell by four players: Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins and wide receiver Torrey Smith; Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett; and former Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Anquan Boldin. In September 2017, Yahoo! Sports published what appears to be an authentic copyof the memo. However, Freedom Daily’s description of it is grossly inaccurate and falsely claims that the four men gave the NFL an “ultimatum” (they did not), made demands (they did not), and that those demands related to fans (the memo did not once mention fans). Jenkins, Smith, Bennett, and Boldin wrote to Goodell to request (not demand) that the commissioner and the league lend their support to a coalition of players interested in community relations and activism, particularly in the areas of criminal justice reform and engagement with police. Specifically, the players suggested that the NFL could take part in visits to prisons, meetings with legislators on the state and national level, interviews and op-eds, engagement with nonprofit and grassroots organizations, and so on. To be clear, we are asking for your support. We appreciate your acknowledgment on the call regarding the clear distinction between support and permission. For us, support means:bearall or part of the weight of; hold up; give assistance to,especially financially; enable to function or act. We needsupport, collaboration and partnerships to achieve our goal ofstrengthening the community. The four players did request that the NFL dedicate the month of November to such activities, but asked that it serve as “a month of Unity” and community relations, in order to move the broader debate away from the national anthem protests. To counter the vast amount of press attention being referred to as the “national anthem protests” versus the large amount of grass roots work that many players around the league have invested their time and resources, we would like to request a league wide initiative that would include a month dedicated to a campaign initiative and related events. Similarly to what the league already implements for breast cancer awareness, honoring military, etc, we would like November to serve as a month of Unity for individual teams to engage and impact the community in their market. At no point in the memo published by Yahoo! Sports do the four players threaten Goodell, offer an ultimatum, or even allude to negative consequences in the event of his inaction or failure to support their efforts. Similarly, the memo contains no mention of fans (white or otherwise), or any obligations or expectations being placed on fans by the NFL. Therefore the two central claims in the Freedom Daily article are entirely false. Freedom Daily is a disreputable web site with a long history of sensationalist, inflammatory, and inaccurate reporting.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:During an interview on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., argued for legislation he’s proposing that would allow guns to be carried into lands controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. To make the case that guns make places safer, Coburn cited a dramatic before-and-after statistic that stems from the lifting of a ban on guns in national parks. Coburn was a leader in the effort to get Congress to approve the change. President Barack Obama signed the national park provision into law, and it took effect in February 2010. \"In 2010,\" Coburn said on Morning Joe, \"everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that.\" That’s a pretty stunning drop. Is it accurate? When we checked with Coburn’s office, John Hart, a spokesman, acknowledged that his senator had misspoken in a way that overstated the decline. Hart said Coburn’s office had compared FBI crime data on National Park Service land from 2008 to 2011, the most recent year available. By the office’s calculations, the number of violent incidents actually dropped by 12 percent, not 85 percent. \"The numbers show crime rates have declined, but he misspoke when he mentioned 85 percent,\" Hart said. \"On balance, the facts support our conclusion that crime rates would go down under our policy, not the conclusion of the amendment’s critics who said that allowing guns in national parks would lead to more crime.\" However, before we bless Coburn’s revised analysis, let’s look at the original data. Here’s a summary chart for violent crimes in the national parks between 2008 and 2011. Year Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Forcible rape Robbery Aggravated assault Total violent crimes 2008 5 37 66 259 367 2009 3 34 64 206 307 2010 15 45 58 251 369 2011 7 34 58 224 323 Change, 2008-11 +40% -8% -12% -14% -12% Change, 2009-11 +133% 0 -9% +9% +5% A few issues jump out to us. First, murders actually went up between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what Coburn said. More importantly, using 2008 as the \"before\" year in this before-and-after comparison amounts to cherry picking. As we noted, the law went into effect in 2010, so the most obvious way to frame the comparison would be to use the data from 2009 (the last full year before the gun ban was lifted) and 2011 (the most recent year). And as it turns out, the comparison to 2009 is not nearly as favorable to Coburn’s overall point. Between 2009 and 2011, these four categories of violent crimes actually rose collectively by 5 percent. Robberies did decline by 9 percent, but murders more than doubled (from a very small base), the number of rapes was stable and the tally of aggravated assaults -- by far the most common of these four crimes -- rose by 9 percent. Meanwhile, it’s also worth noting that the number of crimes in national parks is generally pretty small, which makes it unclear how much stock anyone should place in year-to-year percentage increases and decreases. Finally, we’ll point out that Coburn’s stated decline may -- or may not -- have been caused by the deterrence of having guns around. But if they were a cause for the decline from 2008 to 2011, what’s to stop someone from arguing that they were the cause of the increase from 2009 to 2011? The numbers alone simply don’t tell us. Our ruling On Morning Joe, Coburn said, \"In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that.\" Coburn’s office acknowledges that he misspoke; they actually calculated a decline of 12 percent, which is dramatically lower than 85 percent. But we find even the revised statistic to be questionable. It hinges on using 2008 data, when 2009 data would be more appropriate -- and a comparison using data from 2009 actually shows an increase in violent crime in national parks since the gun ban was lifted. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that guns had an influence on the relatively small number of crimes that take place in national parks. We rate Coburn’s statement False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Hours after Super Tuesday polls closed in Texas at 7 p.m., voters across the state were still standing in lines to cast their ballots. In one North Texas county, Democratic primary voters reported long lines while Republican voters cast ballots with ease. In Austin, people reported lengthy waits throughout the day and some were still waiting to vote at 10:15 p.m. At Texas Southern University in Houston, the last Democratic voter cast his ballot at 1 a.m. Wednesday. In an appearance on NBC’s \"The Tonight Show\" Wednesday, Hillary Clinton remarked on the long lines in Texas. \"It is so wrong what is being done to try and purge people from voting lists, not let them register or, as we saw in places yesterday, particularly in Texas: The Republican side gets 25 machines, the Democratic side gets five machines,\" Clinton said. \"People were literally standing in line for seven hours. I want to applaud everybody that stood in a line yesterday, because they were doing the right thing for our country. Clintonis right that some voters in Texas stood in line for hours to vote on Tuesday, but is she right about the cause? Were more machines allocated to Republican primary voters than to Democrats in Texas? Clinton’s team did not return a request for comment. Differences by county In Texas, elections are conducted at the local level and procedures differ in each of the state’s 254 counties. For example, in Travis, Harris and Tarrant counties, voters can go to any polling place within the county to vote in the primary and general elections. In other counties, voters are restricted to polling places within the precincts where they live. During primary elections, both political parties work with election officials to agree on how the elections are run — including selecting the number of polling places and how voting machines are allocated. In Travis County, which also saw long lines, Democrats and Republicans can vote using the same machines at any polling place during the primary. Some polling places in the county saw staffing disruptions early in the day that caused delays, as eleven people responsible for opening different polling locations did not show up for work over fears of catching the coronavirus. In Harris County, an equal number of voting machines for each party was placed at every polling place. Michael Winn, Harris County’s elections supervisor, told the Austin American-Statesman that this created longer lines for Democratic voters since the Democratic ballot drew more interest than the Republican one, and the county has more Democratic voters. Winn said people in Harris County voted in the Democratic primary at a 2-to-1 ratio compared with Republicans — but two-thirds of voting centers were located in Republican commissioner districts. Local party officials expressed trepidation at Harris County’s plan to divide voting machines equally in emails obtained by the Houston Chronicle. In one Feb. 18 message to county staff, Donna Stanart, the primary election director for the Republican Party wrote: \"A 50/50 split will be a problem at the polls that are going to be heavier for Democrats or heavier for Republicans.\" Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman said in a statement that officials initially believed they were being \"fair and equitable by allocating equal amounts of equipment to each party.\" In Tarrant County, election officials warned of long lines on Super Tuesday after local party officials agreed to have a set number of voting machines for each party, based on a review of past voter turnout data. The plan called for 1,015 Democratic machines and 1,767 Republican machines across the county’s 192 polling sites, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. State lawmakers plan to hold a hearing to investigate the excessive wait times voters experienced and other issues reported by news outlets on Super Tuesday. In a letter to the Texas secretary of state and a handful of local election administrators urging action on improving voting infrastructure in the state, Mimi Marziani, president of the nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project, outlined the different issues voters experienced on Super Tuesday. \"From the time polls opened to when they closed, voters faced a series of obstacles: polling sites that opened hours late or not at all; broken voting machines and ballot-printers; crashed election websites; too many untrained poll workers; and voters’ names missing from the registration rolls,\" she wrote. \"Then, especially later in the day, many voters in our major cities faced absurdly long wait times due to an inadequate number of polling locations, a lack of operational machines per location, and the failure to properly staff each location. As chronicled by numerous press reports, wait times lasted as long as seven hours at points, particularly in communities of color and on college campuses.\" Our Ruling Clinton said that voters in Texas had to wait in long lines because \"the Republican side gets 25 machines, the Democratic side gets five machines.\" Clinton is right that people in Texas waited for hours to vote, but she’s off on the polling machine disparity. In the county that experienced the longest lines on Super Tuesday, a main problem was the opposite of what Clinton described: a local decision to provide an equal number of machines for Republicans and Democrats at each voting location.

            "[Evidences]:Thousands of pairs of shoes dotted the lawn of the U.S. Capitol this week, prompting photos and media coverage about what it meant. Global activistgroup Avaaz set up the demonstration of 7,000 pairs of shoes on March 13 to represent child deaths from gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Many major news outlets including CNN and USA Today shared striking images of the shoes, but some Internet bloggers were confused about what the shoes really symbolized. Take, for example, Equality House, one of many blogs that shared this post on their Facebook page: The image says that shoes on the Capitol lawn represent 7,182 students \"killed in U.S. schools since 2012.\" (The image offers a comparison to deaths from overseas wars since 2001, which is a safer estimate.) But that’s the wrong interpretation. It’s been more than five years since Sandy Hook, so the display featured 7,000 pairs of shoes. That total includes children who are killed at home, in neighborhoods, and by suicide. Far fewer children have been killed in schools. The estimate for 7,000 child gun deaths traces back to aJune 2017 study by Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal. It found that 1,300 children die from gunshot wounds every year. The study looked at children from birth to 17 years of age. The Avaaz news release statedthat the shoes symbolize the children who have been killed by all gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting, not children killed in U.S. schools. There isn’t one uniform way of tracking school shootings and deaths, but no matter which what you look at it, the 7,000-figure isn't accurate. The New York Times published an analysis of the number of people who have been shot in school shootings on Feb. 15, the day after the Parkland school shootings. Using data from the Gun Violence Archive, the Times found that 138 people have been killed in school shootings since Sandy Hook. That total includes school personnel who are not students, so the number of students wouldbe even smaller. The Gun Violence Archive defines a school shooting as an incident that occurs on the property of an elementary, secondary or college campus and only included incidents in which people were injured or killed. So, even if you count all of the other instances of a student being killed on a school campus (for which there is no official count) it’s likely it would not come anywhere near 7,182. Equality House, for its part, noted the difference between the image and the way Avaaz described it in the caption of its post. But the group still circulated the flawed information and did not delete it. Bloggers said shoes on the Capitol lawn this week represented 7,182 students killed in U.S. schools since 2012. That’s not accurate. The pairs of shoes symbolized more than 7,000 children who had been killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting. The number of children killed in school violence, while fluid, is certainly smaller than that total. We rate this claim False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: In Liberia, \"a girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and author Tina Rosenberg recently drew attention to a shocking statistic about women’s education in the African country of Liberia. \"This is education in Liberia,\" Rosenberg wrote in the New York Times on June 14. \"A girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read.\" Liberia was devastated by civil war between 1989 and 2003. More recently, its schools were closed for six months following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014. Our partners at Africa Check looked at the available survey data to determine the accuracy of Rosenberg’s claim. Recent data doesn’t support claim Rosenberg, who won the Pulitzer for non-fictionThe Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism,told Africa Check that her claim was based on a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The database reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by 18. That is fractionally higher than the female youth literacy rate of 37.2 percent, according to the UNICEF database. The problem is those figures come from 2007 reports and are out of date. The 37.9 percent figure for child marriage appears to track back to Liberia’s Demographic and Health Survey from 2007. The youth literacy figure is likely from a 2007 UNESCO Institute for Statistics’ estimate. The estimate covers women between the ages of 15-24, not just girls 18 and under. The most recent data comes from the country’s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. Teen marriage rates in Liberia The Demographic and Health Survey presents data in five year increments for people aged 15 to 49. Women who are 18 fall into the youngest age group of 15 to 19. However, the survey is missing data for marriage rates for this age group. Instead, a United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund note on interpreting child marriage data recommends using the next age group: \"Looking at the group of women 20 to 24 years old is simpler and allows for the inclusion of all girls who were married or in union by age 18 within the closest time period for which complete data are available.\" Following this standard, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This method is imperfect because it doesn’t tell us about the chances that a girl under 20 today will have been married by 18. However, it gives us the best estimate for youth marriage rates for a group of young women who could reasonably be called girls. Literacy rates in Liberia The 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age. Someone is considered literate if they went to high school or if they can read a whole sentence or part of that sentence. The literacy rate decreases slightly to 58.9 percent when you look at women ages 20 to 24. Other organizations define literacy more strictly. For example, UNESCO doesn’t include people who can only read part of a sentence in the literate population. If we apply UNESCO’s literacy definition to Liberian women aged aged 20 to 24, literacy drops to 51.2 percent – still much higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent. Our Ruling Rosenberg made the claim that a Liberian woman is \"more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read.\" This claim relies on data from an old 2007 survey. Using a more recent survey and the closest age group for which data are available, the comparison doesn’t hold. Young Liberian women are more likely to know how to read than be married. We rate this claim Mostly False. This fact-check originally was published by Africa Check.

            "claim [Claim]: Video of four sadhus beaten up is related to child kidnapping in Sangli, Maharashtra\n",
            "[Evidences]:In the past few weeks, there have been multiple reports of people getting attacked across the country over rumours of child kidnapping. This wave of rumours began circulating after a particular incident in Mathura in which the abduction of a child from Mathura railway station was caught on CCTV and shared widely. Police later found the child in the house of a BJP councilor. Following this, claims about child abductors and organ traders wandering in the guise of sadhus began circulating on social media. In some cases, unrelated and old videos and audio clips were used. The impact of these rumours was felt largely in parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand, where people began attacking any unknown individual or group of people deemed suspicious. The victims included mentally challenged persons and ordinary people. For example, a mentally ill woman was beaten up in Sitapur, UP. Mentally challenged boys were being beaten up on charges of child theft in Bhadohi in UP. A similar pattern had also been observed in 2019, when people were beaten up in several parts of India over rumours of child theft. Alt News had debunked these rumours back then, and continues to keep an eye on the situation. Taking cognizance of these cases, police have, in many isntances, dismissed the rumours. Sitapur Police, Moradabad Police, Bareilly Police and Hardoi Police have issued statements. On September 13, news broke of four sadhus being beaten up in Maharashtra’s Sangli district over child theft rumours. The police arrested six people while investigating this case. Reporting on the incident, ABP News aired a video in which a mob is seen beating up sadhus with sticks in front of a shop. ABP News ran the footage as sadhus being thrashed in Maharashtra by locals who mistook them for child kidnappers in Sangli district of Maharashtra. (Archived link) News18 India also played several videos claiming this, in which the first is of the mob thrashing sadhus in front of the shop. (Archived link) Times Now Navbharat also amplified this video with the same claim. (Archived link) Several news outlets followed suit, including Aaj Tak, Republic Live, News18 Lokmat, RSS mouthpiece Organiser Weekly, Zee Salaam, Maharashtra Times, India TV Hindi, Bharat 24, Amar Ujala, right-wing portal OpIndia, and The Lallantop. Navbharat Times journalists ‘Bhadohi Wala’ and Alok Kumar along with India TV Hindi journalist Vikash Tiwary and ISKCON vice-president and spokesperson Radharaman Das also shared the video claiming the incident was from Sangli. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Fact-check Alt News had already investigated the video in question a few days ago. However, other media organisations remained oblivious to this and amplified the video without prior verification. Actually, this video is not from the incident in Sangli district of Maharashtra, nor were the sadhus seen in it beaten up due to the allegation of child theft. The real incident took place in Maharashtra’s Raisen district. IBC24 reported on the incident on August 8, 2022. According to the caption, it took place in Raisen where a group of men had come to commit theft disguised as sadhus. They were later attacked by villagers. Navbharat Times also reported about this incident on August 7. According to the article, some sadhus had robbed a woman after knocking her unconscious in Paloha, located in the Mandideep police station area of ​​Raisen district. The perpetrators, who were dressed as sadhus, stole jewellery and cash from the woman’s house. The villagers tried to find them and discovered they were staying in Pipaliya Gajju village, adjacent to Paloha. After thrashing the sadhus, the locals handed them over to the police. Mandideep Police registered a case against six people in this case and started an investigation. The article quoted police as saying that the accused were residents of Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh. In its coverage of the incident, One India shared a few screengrabs from the video. Police have identified the accused as Bacchu Joshi, Lovelesh Goswami, Mithilesh Goswami, MLA Goswami, Gulab Joshi and Ramswaroop Goswami. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Alt News also reached out to the Mandideep Police Station for more information. SHO Manoj Singh told us that the accused were there to are known to commit some petty theft, disguising as sadhus. The villagers caught and beat them up. They were later taken into custody. Alt News also spoke to Raisen SP Vikas Kumar Sehwal. The police officer told us that the incident was not one of sadhus trying to kidnap children. He said that the sadhus had come to the village to perform a pooja. They asked a woman for gold and silver jewellery for the ceremony. They stole those ornaments and fled. Police registered a case and sent the accused to jail. In other words, this incident is actually from the Paloha village located in Maharashtra’s Raisen district in which locals nabbed a group of thieves who were dressed as sadhus. A video of this was falsely promoted by media organisations as sadhus being beaten up in Maharashtra’s Sangli district over suspicions of child theft. At the same time, such incidents are nothing new. Media outlets have often aired visuals accompanied by misleading claims without verifying them first. Alt News has debunked such fake news circulated by other outlets several times in the past. Donate to Alt News!

            "[Evidences]:Several pictures are being circulated on social media with the claim that they are from the blast site of an IED attack triggered by Naxalites in Chhattisgarh on Friday that injured three Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) jawans. The post, that surfaced a day after the attack, claims that the images are from the blast site near Kosronda camp. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that none of the images shared along with the post are recent. These are images from different Naxal attacks that took place in the country over the years. Viral Image 1 The first two images show security personnel carrying an injured jawan and a damaged vehicle. These photos are from an IED explosion that took place in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur in November 2018. According to a report by The Indian Express, this suspected Maoist attack took place amid Assembly elections in the state, and it had injured six - including four BSF personnel. Viral Image 3 and 4 These two images showing two jawans in a hospital and a wheelchair were carried by multiple media reports in January 2021. According to news agency ANI, the images are from a Naxal attack on Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) jawans. The two injured jawans were reportedly stable. 2 Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) jawans of 16 battalion injured in IED blast triggered by naxals, 4 km from the Orchha police station in Narayanpur district.

According to the Associated Press, the photo is from a Maoist attack that took place in Odisha's Koraput on August 27, 2013. At least five people died and two others were injured in the incident. Viral Image 6 We found this image, purportedly of a blast, carried by multiple websites as from a scene from the 1981 Star Wars film, The Return of the Jedi. We then checked for the movie on the OTT platform Disney+Hotstar. Around 13 minutes into this movie, we can see a shot that exactly resembles the viral image. The same shot from the movie was also uploaded by a user on YouTube. Viral Image 7 The seventh viral image is from an encounter operation by the CRPF’s COBRA Battalion 208 in 2016. This image was carried by The Indian Express on March 7, 2016. As per this report, three CRPF jawans died and 13 were injured in the chase behind top Maoist leaders in Chhattisgarh. Viral Image 8 The second last image is from a Maoist guerilla ambush against a police party in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada in May 2018. As per reports, the incident killed seven jawans who were providing security cover to a road construction project. As per a report by the Business Standard, the incident took place ahead of then Union home minister Rajnath Singh’s visit. The same image was tweeted by ANI on May 20, 2018. Chhattisgarh: 3 jawans of Chhattisgarh Armed Force & 2 jawans of District Force killed and 2 jawans injured in an IED blast on a police vehicle in Dantewada's Cholnar Village.

A BSF jawan was killed by Maoists in the incident. January 14 IED blast in Chhattisgarh According to an ANI report, three Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were injured in a blast triggered by Naxals near the Kosronda camp in Chhattisgarh on Friday, January 14. There was brief firing for around 10 minutes after the blast. The SSB jawans were out for railway line protection duty and were patrolling the forest area when the blast occurred. It is, however, clear that all images in the post are old and not related to the January 14 blast in Chhattisgarh. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim These images are of a Naxal-provoked IED blast that injured three SSB jawans on January 14, 2022 in Chhattisgarh. Conclusion While it is true that three jawans were injured in an IED blast in Chhattisgarh on January 14, none of these images are from the incident. These images are from different Naxal attacks that took place in India between 2013 and 2021.

            "[Evidences]:On 15 February 2016, an image appeared purportedly showing a tweet posted by Senator Ted Cruz threatening to deport singer Beyoncéover her performance at Super Bowl 50: While many people claimed that the above-displayed tweet was real, the message does not appear on Cruz’s timeline, andwe found no evidence proving that it ever did. In fact, there are several aspects about the above-displayed image that made us question its authenticity. First, Ted Cruz is a verified Twitter user, and as such his tweets appear with a blue “verified” mark next to his name, something that is absent from the image: Second, the above-displayed image claims that the messagewas retweeted by more than a thousandusers. If this were true, there would be several links pointing back to Cruz’ original tweet. However, this is not the case. While the image of Cruz’s purported tweet has been shared on social media, they are not accompanied bylinks pointing to a recently deleted tweet from the Senator. Further, Beyoncé performed at the Super Bowl on 7 February 2016, and while Cruz is undoubtedly busy, it would be strange for him to wait a weekafter the fact to comment on thesinger’s performance. It should also be noted that the above-displayed fake tweet was originally accompanied by theclaimthat Anderson Cooper had captured the screenshot from Cruz’s Twitter page: The above-displayed message, however, does not appear on any of Anderson Cooper’s social media profiles, and is as suspect as the original. While one could reasonably assume Cruz would want the Tweet deleted (if it were actually sent in the first place), there is no reason for Cooper to delete his message.

            "[Evidences]:Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share President Biden has proposed a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, to be financed mainly by increases in corporate taxes. Here’s a guide to two misleading talking points that have already emerged. “This is a massive social welfare spending program combined with a massive tax increase on small-business job creators.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight — Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” April 11 Politicians on both sides of the aisle often sing the praises of small businesses. But we were rather surprised to see Wicker claim that increasing the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent would be a burden on small businesses. (Before the 2017 tax law, the corporate rate was 35 percent. Biden argues that the reduction was too steep.) Wicker’s staff noted that Biden’s tax plan does not include a carve-out for small businesses, so “any business, including a small business, that files as a C-corporation would see their tax rate increase from 21 percent to 28 percent,” an aide said. The aide pointed to a National Federation of Independent Business report that cites “federal taxes on business income” as the third most severe issue facing small-business owners, with 20 percent of respondents finding federal taxes on income to be a “critical” issue in operating their businesses. Advertisement But here’s the problem with Wicker’s statement: A relatively small percentage of small businesses file as C-corporations. Of those that do, many owe little in taxes, so Biden’s tax increase would not affect them. Most small businesses are structured as pass-through entities — such as partnerships, S corporations and so forth — meaning that the companies themselves pay no taxes. The owners pay tax on the business income at their individual tax rate and report the business income on their personal tax returns. For virtually all small businesses, especially profitable ones, it makes more sense to organize as pass-through entities. (C-corporations are subject to double taxation of profits, while pass-throughs are taxed only once.) In 2018, the Treasury Department examined the tax filings of small businesses. In 2010, it found, fewer than 6 percent filed as C-corporations. On top of that, the net income of those small businesses filing as C-corporations was negative; little is likely to have been paid in taxes. (By contrast, large businesses filing as C-corporations reported significant net income.) Advertisement According to the Internal Revenue Service, in 2017, small corporations, those with less than $10 million of receipts, reported only about $40 billion of the $1 trillion of income reported by all corporations. And the Federal Reserve reports that very few C-corporations are privately held, let alone being small. Wicker’s staff responded to this tax data by emphasizing the number of small businesses that file as C-corporations. A random-sample survey of the National Federation of Independent Business found that 20 percent of the NFIB’s members filed as C-corporations. A 2018 Congressional Research Service report, using 2015 data, estimated that nearly 1 million small businesses filed as C-corporations. None of these numbers, of course, suggest that these firms face “a massive tax increase” from a hike in the corporate tax rate, especially because the Treasury and IRS documents suggest small businesses filing as C-corporations pay relatively little in taxes. Advertisement A Wicker aide also argued that Biden is planning further tax increases that might harm small businesses that file as pass-throughs. That might be the case — but that’s a fact check for another day. “The proposed tax increases in the Biden administration’s infrastructure plan could lead to 1 million fewer jobs in the first two years.” — Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), in a tweet quoting a report from the National Association of Manufacturers, April 13 This tweet directed readers to a news release issued April 8 by NAM. But here’s the funny thing: When you read the actual report on which this figure is based, it does not mention Biden’s infrastructure plan at all. Moreover, it includes tax increases that are not part of Biden’s plan, though he mentioned some on the campaign trail. Jamie Hennigan, a NAM spokesman, said “that link was a quick snippet on our website.” He directed us to a fuller news release, which did not directly link the alleged job losses to the Biden infrastructure proposal. Advertisement Essentially, the NAM study looked only at the impact of tax increases, which general economic theory says would result in job losses. But it assumed that the money was spent on general transfer payments — not the job-creating infrastructure proposals pitched by Biden. Moody’s Analytics, for instance, studied the Biden plan and said growth will slow slightly in early 2022, trimming about 23,000 jobs, as Biden’s proposed tax increases are felt before infrastructure spending really gets started later that year. But then in 2024, there would be an extra 1.5 million jobs created — and an extra million jobs in 2025. A Penn-Wharton Budget model study, by contrast, was more pessimistic about the long-term impact of the plan on the gross domestic product. “The study looks at tax increases only,” acknowledged John Diamond of Rice University, one of the NAM study’s co-authors. “And the tax increases are not exactly the tax increases in the Biden package but are very similar in many ways. You are correct that in the NAM paper we never mention infrastructure — that is intentional because we did not include it in the simulations.” Advertisement He said they were working on a paper that explicitly models and includes the positive effects of infrastructure spending vs. negative impacts of tax increases — though the study will assume that the spending will all be on “pure infrastructure,” which is not necessarily the formal Biden plan. As for the assessment of a loss of 1 million jobs over two years, the paper assumes that when taxes go up, working becomes relatively less attractive, so people work a bit less. Then the authors totaled up the decline in the number of hours worked and converted that to an equivalent number of full-time jobs. The paper includes a whole series of caveats about these numbers. But such nuances were lost in the translation to a NAM news release and ultimately a tweet by a U.S. senator. After our query, NAM, to its credit, changed the wording of the news release and added this note: “The lead sentence was revised to better reflect the full scope of the NAM’s study, which includes corporate tax increases recently proposed by the Biden administration, as well as other tax increases and changes to the tax code under consideration.” Advertisement Blunt’s staffers noted that the news release was changed and then, also to their credit, deleted the tweet. “NAM strongly supports infrastructure investment but opposes changes to the tax code under consideration, like those outlined in our study,” Hennigan said. The Pinocchio Test Both of these claims take a modicum of fact and spin it beyond reality. Blunt tweeted about a study that did not even pretend to be about Biden’s infrastructure proposal or his actual tax proposal. Moreover, the study is missing half of the equation — the jobs that would be created by infrastructure spending. So it’s wrong to claim that it shows the Biden infrastructure plan could cost 1 million jobs in two years. We applaud NAM for fixing its news release and Blunt for deleting the tweet; otherwise this claim would have been worthy of Three Pinocchios. Advertisement Meanwhile, a relatively small percentage of small businesses could be affected by Biden’s proposed corporate tax increases, but it’s more likely they would not face what Wicker called a “massive tax increase.” The vast majority of small businesses simply do not file as C-corporations. So Biden’s proposed hike in the corporate tax would be likely to mean little to a small-business owner. Wicker earns Three Pinocchios.

            "[Evidences]:Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh are scheduled to be held between February 10 and March 10, 2022. In this backdrop, an image is being widely shared on social media in which two people of different faiths can be seen holding a poster on which “यूपी में आ रही है कांग्रेस” (English translation: Congress is coming in UP) is written. The post is being shared with a caption that reads, “गंगा जमुनी तहजीब की तस्वीर चंद ज़हरीले लोगो के जहर से खत्म नही होने वाली । ये तस्वीर इस और भी इशारा कर रही है कि उत्तरप्रदेश के दिल मे इस बार सिर्फ कांग्रेस है । हिन्दू मुस्लिम सिक्ख ईसाई आपस में हम भाई भाई! बोलता उत्तरप्रदेश आ रही है काँग्रेस.” (English translation: The picture of Ganga Jamuni culture is not going to end with the hatred of a few poisonous people. This picture indicates even more that Congress is in the heart of Uttar Pradesh this time. Hindu Muslim Sikh Christians we are brothers! Uttar Pradesh is speaking Congress is coming !”) The link to the post can be seen here. FACT CHECK NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be fake. On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found that a similar image was published by a Facebook page on March 3, 2021. In the original image, the poster in the background is of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. We also found that a verified Facebook page of Didi Ke Bolo, which was an election campaign by All India Trinamool Congress during West Bengal State Elections 2021, had also uploaded the image with a caption that reads, “‘সামাজিক ঐক্য দিচ্ছে রায় বাংলা নিজের মেয়েকেই চায়’ আপনি কি আগামী দিনেও বাংলায় উন্নয়ন চান? তাহলে, এই ওয়েবসাইটে গিয়ে বাংলার মেয়েকে সমর্থন জানানোর শপথ নিন।” (English translation via Google: Social unity is giving the verdict. Bangla wants its own daughter. Do you want development in Bengal in the future? So, take an oath to support the girl of Bengali by going to this website.) Hence, we can conclude that a poster showing people of two different faiths holding a poster of Mamata Banerjee has been morphed and is being shared with a fake claim that people of different faiths are holding posters of Congress ahead of UP Polls.

            "[Evidences]:President Donald Trump has been consistent and forceful in his argument that immigration represents a burden on the American taxpayer and the economy. His administration has sought to crack down on illegal immigration and curtail legal immigration, most recently by ordering a 60-day halt on issuance of green cards to people outside the United States. But a Facebook post crediting him with saving billions by denying welfare to \"illegal immigrants\" is inaccurate. \"President Trump has banned welfare for illegal immigrants which will save $57.4 billion a year,\" said the April 9 Facebook post. \"Do you support Trump on this?? I damn sure do!!\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are several wrong premises with the post: Immigrants living in the country illegally and those who arrive on non-immigrant visas (such as students and tourists) are generally not eligible for federal public benefits, even though some pay income taxes and contribute to Social Security. This was the case before Trump became president. The Trump administration issued a rule in August 2019 that broadened the government’s ability to deny visas and permanent-resident status to immigrants who get public benefits or those who may need assistance after their arrival. The rule targets people who are seeking legal admission and those who are here and applying for permanent residency. The Facebook post doesn’t specify where the $57.4 billion figure comes from, but the post mirrors a headline on a Breitbart story. That story, however, was about legal immigration. Here's a more detailed explanation of the inaccuracies. Generally, immigrants living illegally in the United States are ineligible for federal public benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (commonly called food stamps), regular Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. These restrictions are not the result of Trump’s presidency. They may be eligible for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, Emergency Medicaid to cover emergency medical needs, and other emergency assistance, such as short-term non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster relief (which includes things like crisis counseling, shelter, food and water.) For decades, even immigrants who came to the United States legally have been restricted from public assistance for a period. A 1996 law barred immigrants from federal \"means tested\" public benefits for five years. (There are some exemptions; this story has more details.) Additionally, public-charge rules say that immigrants can be turned away if they are likely to depend on public-assistance programs; this type of restriction has been in place for more than 100 years. The Trump administration in August 2019 broadened the interpretation of these rules to make them stricter. But that did not ban welfare for immigrants here illegally. Immigration experts told PolitiFact that under the new rule, immigration officials will be able to deny immigrants visas if they are deemed \"more likely than not\" to use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are in the United States legally on temporary visas and have relied on such benefits in the past could also have more difficulty getting a green card. The Facebook post claimed that the purported ban would save Americans $57.4 billion a year. An August 2018 Breitbart headline said, \"Trump’s welfare ban for immigrants would be $57.4B tax cut for Americans.\" The story centered on Trump’s plan for a public-charge rule and immigrants who would \"resettle permanently\" in the United States. That Breitbart story linked to a 2016 post on its website headlined, \"National Academies: Immigrants cost state and local taxpayers $57.4 billion per year.\" A study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine estimated that the annual fiscal cost of first-generation immigrants and their dependents, averaged across 2011-2013, was $57.4 billion. The figure referred to state and local expenses, not federal costs or benefits, and the main cost was education, said Francine D. Blau, a Cornell University economics professor who chaired the panel of researchers studying the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration. \"We find that much of this cost is related to the cost of educating both immigrant children and U.S. citizen children of immigrants (we attribute the entire cost of education to the parents of school age children),\" Blau said via email. \"The cost is smaller if we recognize the public-good aspect of education, that is, the broader social benefits in having a more educated populace.\" The $57.4 billion also included costs of general public services such as police, fire, parks and recreation. It also did not apply only to immigrants in the country illegally. The study relied on data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, which did not allow researchers to differentiate between immigrants here legally and illegally, Blau said. A Facebook post said, \"President Trump has banned welfare for illegal immigrants which will save $57.4 billion a year.\" Trump has not done that. Immigrants here illegally were already ineligible for most federal assistance programs. Trump’s administration issued a public-charge rule that would deny legal admission to people who are likely to depend on public benefits and which would make getting lawful permanent residency more difficult for people who are already in the country and used public assistance. The source of the $57.4 billion figure is unclear. A study estimated a $57.4 billion annual cost to state and local governments for first generation immigrants and their dependents. Schooling costs accounted for the bulk of that cost. The post is inaccurate. We rate it False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:In his 2019 State of Devolution Address, council of governors chair Wycliffe Oparanya made three claims on revenue allocation to counties, two claims each on healthcare and agriculture, and a claim on gender equality in county governments.Two of the claims on revenue were correct, as were claims about gender equality and healthcare facilities.One claim about agriculture was mostly correct, and the other incorrect. A third claim on revenue was also mostly correct, but a claim on healthcare budgets was incorrect.On 28 June Kenya’s county governors issued the 2019State of Devolution Addressin which they laid out the achievements of the 47 county governments in agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, budgeting and gender equality.The statement was released amid arevenue warbetween Kenya’s senate and national assembly, at a time when the country wasrethinkingthe counties’ share of national revenue.The address was delivered by Wycliffe Oparanya, chair of thecouncil of governorsand governor ofKakamega County, two days before the end of the 2018/19 financial year. In the statement he celebrated that counties were allocating more money to development.But do his claims add up?We checked.Claim “County governments have allocated on average 6.7 % of their total budgets to the agriculture sector.” Verdict mostly-correctAfrica Check asked Ruth Chitwa, the council of governors’ acting director of communications, for the source of the data. She referred us to the council’s monitoring and evaluation team, who asked us to send an email with our queries. But despite repeated reminders, we have not yet received a response. (Note: We will update this report should we do so.)In his address, Oparanya said the counties were aware of their crucial role in achieving food and nutrition security for Kenya, which was why they had increased funding for agriculture.Budget allocations for the 47 county governments are captured in reports by thecontroller of budget, who authorises all government spending. The annual county budget implementation review report for the2017/18financial year and the latesthalf-year reportfor 2018/19 contain each county’s budget allocations to agriculture.From the reports’ line item allocations to agriculture, we calculated that counties set aside5.6%of their budgets to agriculture in 2017/18, and6.3%in the first six months of 2018/19.The most recent publicly available data shows that counties gave 6.3% of their total budgets to agriculture. Oparanya said the share was 6.7%. We rate his claim as mostly correct.(Note: The latest economic surveyshowsthat in 2017/18, counties spent KSh11.8 billion on agriculture out of KSh336.4 billion in total spending. This is just 3.5% of the total. In 2018/19, the projected expenditure on agriculture is KSh27.8 billion out of a total of KSh459.5 billion. This is 6.1% of the total.) – Alphonce ShiunduClaim “This is just 3% less of the 10% recommended allocation [for agriculture] as per the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) Malabo declaration.” Verdict misleadingIn 2004, 44 members of theAfrican Unionresolved toset aside“at least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture.'' In the 2014Malabo declaration, the AU upheld the commitment for “at least 10% of public expenditure” to go to agriculture. This was to boost economies and improve food security.In hisaddress, Oparanya said Kenyan counties could achieve the 10% investment in agriculture “if the devolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are released to counties”. Kenya’s2010 constitutionmakes agriculture a “devolved function”, a responsibility of the counties.In 2017/18, counties allocated anestimatedKSh23 billion to agriculture out of an estimated total budget of KSh411.6 billion – about 5.6%. A 10% allocation would have been KSh41.1 billion.In 2018/19, agriculture’s shareroseto KSh29.1 billion (6.3%) out of a total of KSh462.1 billion. A 10% allocation would have been KSh46.2 billion.This works out to a difference of just over three percentage points.But the difference between the 2018/19 allocation of KSh29.1 billion and the Malabo aspiration of at least 10% of the total county budget (KSh46.2 billion) works out to a gap of 37%, not 3%.We therefore rate Oparanya’s claim as misleading.– Alphonce ShiunduClaim “We experienced an increase in the number of functional health facilities growing from 9,858 to 10,820 in 2018 across all counties. Verdict correctThe latest economic surveyshowsthat the number of health facilities rose from 9,858 in 2017 to 10,820 in 2018.Oparanya referenced 2018 data, and the latest economic survey bears him out.The numbers come from theKenya master health facilities list, an inventory of the country’s health facilities and community units. These are “identified with unique code and their details describing the geographical location, administrative location, ownership, type and the services offered”.The list can be sorted to show which facilities are operational and which are closed.As at 18 July 2019 thenumberof operational health facilities was 11,993.– Alphonce ShiunduClaim “For the year under review all County Governments allocated out of their budgets at least 20% to health.” Verdict incorrectThe controller of budget’s 2017/18reportshows countiesallocatedKSh109.2 billion to health out of a total budget of KSh411.6 billion. This means26.5% of the budgetwent to health.In2018/19the countiesallocatedKSh114.6 billion to health out of a budget of KSh462.1 billion, giving health a25% share.So the total allocation to health for all the counties was above 20%.But not all counties set aside at least 20% of their budgets for healthcare. In 2017/18 at least five counties allocated less than 20% to health. These were Kakamega (17.1%), Laikipia (13.4%), Taita Taveta (7.7%), Tana River (17.8%) and Turkana (11.6%).And in 2018/19, nine counties allocated less than 20% of their budgets to health. These were Baringo (2%), Kakamega (13%), Laikipia (13%), Mandera (18%), Nyandarua (11%), Taita Taveta (7%), Tana River (19%), Turkana (11%) and Wajir (17%).We therefore rate the claim as incorrect.– Alphonce ShiunduClaim “Since 2013, County Governments have cumulatively received KSh1.57 trillion worth of equitable share of allocation.” Verdict mostly-correctAfrica Check looked at the controller of budget’sreportsfor2012/13,2013/14,2014/15,2015/16,2016/17,2017/18and thefirst nine months of 2018/19.The controller of budget approves the release of revenue from the consolidated fund to the counties.Africa Checkpreviously investigatedcounty figures and found that not all the money allocated to county governments was transferred to them.

The latest figures show that the treasury transferred KSh1.608 trillion to the counties between March 2013 and 30 May 2019. Up to 31 March 2019, the controller approved KSh1.514 trillion.The amount actually received by counties is between KSh1.611 trillion and KSh1.514 trillion. Oparanya’s claim of KSh1.57 trillion is within the ballpark. We therefore rate it as mostly correct.– Alphonce ShiunduClaim KSh1.57 trillion is equivalent to 20% of the total shareable revenue of 7.8 trillion shillings.” Verdict correctThe total shareable revenue from 2013 to 2019 is given in thedivision of revenue acts:2013 – KSh920.4 billion2014 – KSh1,026. 3 billion2015 – KSh1,242.7 billion2016 – KSh1,380.2 billion2017 – KSh1,560.3 billion2018 – KSh1,688.5 billionThese add up to KSh7, 818 billion, or KSh7.8 trillion – the exact figure given by Oparanya.According to the treasury, the transfers to county governments as at 30 May 2019 add up to KSh1,611 billion. The controller of budget’s report puts the amount approved for use by counties at KSh1,514 trillion up to 31 March 2019. These work out as 21% and 19% of the KSh7.8 trillion in total shareable revenue.Oparanya was right on the money when he said the amount of national revenue transferred to the counties was equivalent to 20% of all the money the counties had received.– Alphonce ShiunduClaim “The average development allocation by counties over the last six financial years has been 40% surpassing the legal requirement of at least 30%.” Verdict correctKenyan law on public financedirectsthat “over the medium term a minimum of 30% of the county government’s budget shall be allocated to the development expenditure”. The lawdefinesthe “medium term” as “a period of not less than three years but not more than five years”.The total allocation over six years, given in the controller of budget’sreports, is shown below.

We therefore rate Oparanya’s claim as correct.– Alphonce ShiunduClaim So far, each of the 47 counties has met the two-thirds threshold on the appointment of the county executive committee members, with three counties of Kilifi, Nyeri and Kericho attaining a 50-50 representation.” Verdict correctKenya’sconstitutionpromotes gender equality by setting out that “not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender”.The latest economic surveyshowsthat Oparanya was right when he said each of the 47 counties had adhered to this gender principle. It alsoshowsthat in Kilifi, Nyeri and Kericho counties there’s gender parity in the composition of the county cabinets.The economic survey’s data came from thecouncil of governors. Africa Check asked thenational gender and equality commission, which oversees the two-thirds gender rule, if there was more recent data.“We are just about to embark on county audit that will give us a lot of that data,” commissionerPriscilla Nyokabitold Africa Check. The commission does have thegender datafor members of the county assemblies, she said. This is the data used in the 2019 economic survey.“It will be very important that the gender principle is respected,”she told us. “I am asking governors, not just to do the minimum. Wherever they find a woman who performs, give her an opportunity to perform. They should give women an opportunity to serve.” –Dancan BwireFurther readinghttps://africacheck.org/reports/yes-kenyas-health-budget-has-risen-30-in-last-two-fiscal-years/https://africacheck.org/reports/how-kenyatta-mangled-his-numbers-on-kenyan-counties-development-spend/https://africacheck.org/reports/yes-kenyas-county-funding-based-on-five-year-old-national-revenue-figures/\n",

            "[Evidences]: Gun control is a top priority for California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. So, it’s no surprise Newsom, a Democrat and 2018 candidate for governor, promoted the cause on National Gun Violence Awareness Day. He claimed in a statement on Twitter on June 2, 2017: \"Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries. We've had enough. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay.\" This is not the first time we’ve fact-checked a gun claim by Newsom. In November 2016, we rated Mostly True his assertion that California has seen a \"56 percent decline in the gun murder rate\" since the 1990s. Earlier that year, we rated Mostly False his statement that \"So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days.\" In this case, we wondered whether the facts support his claim about the seemingly huge disparity in gun homicide rates between the United States and other developed countries. We’ll fact-check this claim below. First, here’s some background on Newsom and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Newsom is among several prominent Democrats as of now competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; California Treasurer John Chiang and Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction. Announced Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at[emailprotected], tweet us@CAPolitiFactor contact us onFacebook. Newsom has supported California’s stringent gun and ammunition laws. In 2016, he proposed and helped pass Proposition 63, a voter initiative that requires instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Our research We interpreted Newsom’s claim of \"shot and killed\" to mean gun homicides. These are intentional killings using a firearm, not including suicides. To back up the statement, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in March 2016 called \"Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010.\" The study relied on mortality data from 2010 collected by the World Health Organization. It found the rate of gun homicides was 25.2 times higher in the United States than in 22 other populous and high-income countries for which data was also gathered. A sample of those included South Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. When considering all types of gun deaths, such as homicides, accidental shootings and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries, the report said. Authors of study weigh in We contacted the co-authors of this study. Both described Newsom’s claim as \"accurate.\" \"Yes, what he said seems accurate,\" David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author, said by email. \"I think anyone who looks at the data would agree.\" Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of San Francisco and the other co-author, also said the claim was correct. Grinshteyn described the report as \"purely an academic study.\" She said her portion of the work was not funded while Hemenway’s participation was funded, in part, by the Joyce Foundation. On its website, the foundation says it supports \"research-based strategies that can prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms.\" Related study In 2014, PolitiFact examined a related claim by lawyer and author Lisa Bloom that said \"Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries.\" PolitiFact took this to mean gun homicides. It rated her claim Mostly True, citing figures collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. That data showed the United States had a slightly lower gun homicide rate in 2010 than reported in the American Journal of Medicine Study. That, in turn, meant Americans would be closer to 20 times as likely to die in gun homicides compared with several other \"civilized countries.\" But as PolitiFact noted, much depends on which countries are included in this comparison and the years for which that data was available. Chile and Turkey, both with relatively high gun homicide rates, were included in the United Nations study but not in the report in the American Journal of Medicine. Grinshteyn told us her study only included high-income, populous countries as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. \"If they included Chile and Turkey, which were not included in our comparison group, those will cause the comparison to be skewed,\" she added. We reached out to the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, to ask whether its members knew of any additional and independent reports on this topic. We did not immediately hear back. Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said \"Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries.\" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information. In the end, we rated Newsom’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE– The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n",

            "[Evidences]: Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In a nearly 12-minute video shared from the verified Facebook account of Ted Nugent, the musician vented his frustrations about the COVID-19 pandemic, while amplifying conspiracy theories, in a bizarre rant. “I ain’t scared. I ain’t scared of nothing,” said Nugent before going on a tangent about “knowing every songbird.” At about the 1:30 mark, the musician then lamented the decisions made by production companies to cancel tours in 2021. “We are not waiting for any authorization from any bureaucratic entity to say, ‘you can go ahead and tour now.’ You know, this year’s tour is canceled again. Are you kidding me? The production companies won’t let us tour again this year,” said Nugent. “Dirty, bastards, lying, scam, smoke and mirrors, COVID-19 freaks.” And at the 2:20 mark, the 72-year-old asked his viewers the following: You know, I guess I would ask you — because I’m addicted to truth, logic and common sense — and my common-sense meter would demand the answer to why weren’t we shut down for COVID one through 18? COVID-1 — and there was a COVID 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 — COVID one through 18 didn’t shut anything down but woah, COVID-19! He did not appear to be joking. Much of the information included in Nugent’s social media rant was misleading and rife with misinformation. For example, Nugent echoed erroneous claims that numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths have been exaggerated (we fact-checked similar claims here, here, and here) and questioned whether the 500,000 total death count was accurate. (As of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed more than 539,000 associated deaths in the U.S.) Nugent also claimed that COVID-19 is “99.8% survivable” (False) and questioned why there were no shutdowns for other pandemics like the so-called Spanish Flu of 1918 (In fact, there were many.) The respiratory disease COVID-19 was named in February 2020 for the coronavirus that causes it — SARS-CoV-2 — and the year in which the first disease case was reported — 2019. Following that logic, Nugent’s proclamation of a “COVID one through 18” would suggest that there had been 18 years of coronavirus infection rates at a global scale, which is unfounded. And though COVID-19 is the only respiratory disease to be caused by SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses have prompted government response in the last two decades. Coronaviruses make up a large family of zoonotic viruses that are found around the world in a variety of animals, from bats and pangolins to tigers, dogs, and humans. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was also caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and marked the “first pandemic of the 21st century.” According to the CDC, the disease did not spread widely in U.S. communities and though the country did not go on lockdown, the health agency issued a number of emergency responses to battle a potential widespread outbreak. Globally, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS, 774 of whom died. Only eight people in the U.S. were laboratory-confirmed to have been infected by the virus. Similarly, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a coronavirus caused by MERS-CoV and was first reported in September 2012. But only two people in the U.S. have ever tested positive for MERS-CoV infection — both in May 2014.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Authorities say a 13-year-old Alabama girl with special needs was beheaded after she saw her grandmother killed in a cemetery. Huntsville television station WAFF reported the details of a grisly crime which emerged at a preliminary hearing in a Madison County court for 26-year-old Yoni Aguilar, who, along with 34-year-old Israel Palomino, is charged with two counts of capital murder in the June 2018 slayings of 49-year-old Oralia Mendoza and her granddaughter, Mariah Lopez. According to court testimony, in the days before the murder Aguilar, Palomino, Mendoza, and Mendoza’s friend Laticia Garcia went to Georgia to pick up a large amount of drugs, and something that took place during the trip prompted Palomino and Mendoza to engage in an ultimately fatal argument. Aguilar and Palomino eventually drove the victims to a cemetery, where Mendoza was fatally stabbed: The grandmother was associated with the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug-trafficking organization, a Madison County sheriff’s investigator testified. It was June 2 when Palomino, Aguilar, Mendoza and a woman named Leticia Garcia went to pick up a quarter kilo of meth in Norcross, Georgia, a small city northeast of Atlanta, authorities said. Something apparently went wrong during the trip, [Investigator Stacy] Rutherford told the court. It was Mendoza and Garcia who were tied to the [Sinaloa] cartel, and Palomino thought there might be a setup, the investigator testified. During the early morning hours of June 4, Mendoza was told she and Lopez would be taken somewhere safe. Instead, Rutherford testified, Palomino and Aguilar drove the woman and her granddaughter to Moon Cemetery on Cave Springs Road. Mendoza and Palomino got out of the car and argued about the drug buy, according to Aguilar’s account. The argument escalated, and Aguilar told police Palomino killed Mendoza. I just left the preliminary hearing for Yoni Aguilar, one of the accused killers in the Madison County slayings of a grandma and 13-year-old. pic.twitter.com/LvVlYklyfO — Ashley Remkus (@aremkus1) July 12, 2018 The suspects reportedly killed 13-year-old Mariah because she was a witness to the slaying of her grandmother, taking her to a secluded area where, Aguilar claimed, Palomino forced him to kill the girl: Aguilar claims Palomino killed Mendoza. Investigators say he told them that he was sitting in the passenger seat while Palomino and Mendoza were outside talking. That’s when he said he saw Mendoza’s arms slide down the car and Palomino jump in the car and leave with Mariah in the backseat. In court, the investigator added that Aguilar told them that they had to kill Mariah because she witnessed her grandmother’s murder. Mendoza was Mariah’s main guardian. Mariah was also on the autism spectrum. Aguilar told investigators that Palomino held his hand with the knife and moved it back and forth to behead the 13-year old. Palomino denies he made Aguilar kill Mariah. The disreputable web site Your News Wire published an article on this subject headlined “Illegal Immigrant Beheads 13-Year-Old Girl in Alabama — Media Blackout,” which asserted that “the mainstream media has failed to report on the barbaric crime” because “mainstream media outlets are now choosing to suppress horrific news stories involving illegal immigrants.” However, the underlying crimes were in fact widely reported by multiple national U.S. news outlets, including Fox News, the Washington Post, the Associated Press, and Cox Media Group. Moreover, according to Huntsville station WAAY, while Aguilar was an undocumented immigrant, Palomino was legally in the U.S. on a green card. Since it’s as yet unclear what involvement each of the two men had in Mariah Lopez’s death, it cannot be definitively stated at this time that an “illegal immigrant beheaded a 13-year-old.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:Trump officials have not objected raising funds for preparedness of coronavirus until Democrat MPs agree to transfer $37 million from the LIHEAP. The Trump administration will pay for the coronavirus response in part by cutting funds from health programs, including one that pays for heating and cooling assistance for the poor. According to a notice sent by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to Congress obtained by The Hill, Trump administration has proposed $37 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The press release from the official website of Ed Markey states in a letter dated 27 February 2020, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that Elizabeth Warren had made a new proposal for emergency funds to prepare the United States for a possible widespread outbreak of coronavirus as an instead for transferring money from Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which is in underfunded. In a letter to congressional appropriators, Joe Kennedy III, Chellie Pingree, and Peter Welch showed their views against the proposal made by Trump administration’s emergency preparations to control coronavirus through removing the funding of $37 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. All the above statements made by Democrat MPs depicts that they are against the proposal of Trump administration. To pass a proposal, it is a requirement to get a majority in the House of Representatives, which proves that the proposal is unapproved. Meanwhile, there is no statement made by Republicans or government officials that they refusing to fund emergency preparations for coronavirus pandemic until Democrats MP's agree to cut home heating and cooling assistance for the poor by $37 million. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation.

            "[Evidences]:President Jacob Zuma's government has done \"a good job of stabilising the economy and investing in infrastructure to propel the economy into the next phase of growth, while investing in improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable\".This is one of the central claims made by Jeff Radebe – the Minister in the Presidency responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation – in a lengthy article defending the president's performance. It followed an attempt by an opposition party to introduce a motion of no confidence against Zuma.Radebe listed a number of achievements he attributed to the Zuma and the government. “This is not a political stunt,\" he wrote, \"this is no fiction; this is reality.\"Are his statements based on reality? Africa Check assessed them.(Note: Radebe’s office failed to respond to several requests for the source material on which he based his claims. A government spokesperson, Phumla Williams, also ignored calls and text messages. We have evaluated the claims by drawing on publicly available data and information.)VotingClaim “In 2014, more than 62% of South Africans made their democratic choice to choose a political party of their choice.” Verdict incorrectEconomic growthClaim “By the fourth quarter of 2014, GDP showed signs of recovery at a 4.1%. What is important, though, is that the real sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, were positive and actually grew.” Verdict misleadingEmploymentClaim “Whilst jobs were lost [due to the recession], in 2014 South Africa has actually managed to employ even more people than were employed in the years when jobs were lost, implying that there is recovery.” Verdict misleadingRenewable energyClaim “Under the stewardship of President Zuma, South Africa has one of the largest renewable energy programmes ranked among the top 10 in the world.” Verdict incorrectElectricityClaim “The percentage of households connected to the electricity mains increased from 82% to 85%.” Verdict correctWaterClaim “The percentage of households connected to piped water increased from 88% to 90%.” Verdict mostly-correctSanitationClaim “The percentage of households with access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 70% to 78%.” Verdict mostly-correctEducationClaim “The percentage of persons aged 20 years and above with no formal education or highest level of education less than Grade 7 within each gender group decreased from 19.3% to 16.2%.” Verdict correctLife expectancyClaim “South Africans now live nine years longer than they did in 2005 due to the roll-out by this government of drugs that prolong life.” Verdict correctStudent aidClaim “[The] National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) increased from R2.4 billion in 2008 to R9.5 billion in 2014.” Verdict mostly-correctPovertyClaim “South Africans benefit from a cocktail of social assistance programmes and services that alleviate poverty and indeed poverty has visibly been reduced since 2000.” Verdict correctState spendingClaim “South Africans have continued to trust government with their taxes. South Africa’s budget in 1994 was R135.1-billion; by 2004 this had doubled to R370-billion and R834-billion in 2009. The Minister of Finance recently announced a budget of R1.3-trillion. This means that since 2009 we have added more than the equivalent of the entire budget of 2004 and seen a 1,000% increase since 1994.” Verdict incorrectSouth Africa had a population of around 54-million people in 2014. According to the Independent Electoral Commission , an estimated 31.4-million people were eligible to vote in 2014 but only about 18.4-million people turned up to vote. The ANC garnered 11.4-million votes This means that 21% of all South Africans, or 36% of all eligible voters, voted for the ANC. Sixty two percent of all valid votes cast were for the African National Congress.Radebe is right on the numbers, but the financial quarter he chose to highlight paints a much brighter economic picture than is actually the case.The deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Francois Groepe, made the distinction in a recent address : “Although the South African economy expanded at a brisk annualised rate of 4.1% in the final quarter of 2014, growth for the full year was a disappointing 1.5% and represents the second-lowest growth rate recorded over the past sixteen years.” If you look at 2014 as a whole , the mining sector actually contracted by 1.6%, while the manufacturing industry showed no growth. Agriculture did increase by 5.6% percent.Radebe’s claim only deals with absolute labour statistics, that is, the actual number of people employed. In the fourth quarter of 2008 there were approximately 14.7-million people employed in the South African economy. By the third quarter of 2010 1.1-million jobs had been lost.Since then employment has increased. The most recent employment statistics show that 15.3-million people were employed in the fourth quarter of 2014 However, Radebe’s claim is misleading in that the unemployment rate has not recovered to pre-recession levels. Ratios are a better measure than absolute figures, the executive manager of labour statistics at Stats SA, Peter Buwembo, has told Africa Check.Prior to the recession the narrow unemployment rate was 21.5%. The latest statistics show the unemployment rate was 24.3% at the end of 2014.According to Kadri Nassiep, CEO of the state-owned South African National Energy Development Institute , “countries such as China, US and Germany still lead the way in total installed capacity”.He added that South Africa falls in the top 5 countries when the size of its renewable energy investment is compared to GDP. Uruguay, Mauritius and Costa Rica topped this ranking in the 2014 Global Status Report, compiled by international renewable network REN21.South Africa did make the top 10 list for investment in renewable energy in 2012 and 2013. The two most recent reports by Bloomberg New Energy Finance stated that South Africa invested $5.7-billion in renewable energy in 2012 and $4.9-billion in 2013 China was head and shoulders above the rest: investing $64.7-billion and $54.2-billion in those years. It already has an installed renewable energy capacity of 378GW , whereas South Africa aims for 6.7GW by 2016 and 17.8GW by 2030 The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of households connect to electricity mains increased from 82.7% in 2009 to 85.4% in 2013. The statistics for 2014 will be released around the middle of this year.The 2013 General Household Survey revealed that 89.9% of households had access to piped water, up from 89% when Zuma took office. Just over 4% of households had to fetch water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools and dams, wells and springs.But this one statistic does not provide the full picture about access to water in South Africa. In 2013 a quarter of households reported interruptions to their water supply that lasted more than 2 days at a time or lasted more than 15 days in total.Households also reported problems with the quality of water they received. In 2013 7.4% households (1.1-million) felt that their water was not safe to drink, 7.9% that their water was not clear, 8.8% that their water did not taste good whereas just over a million households (6.9%) felt that their water was not free from bad smells.The 2013 General Household Survey showed that access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 72.4% of households in 2009 to 77.9% of households in 2013. RDP standard sanitation includes flush toilets (either connected to a public sewerage system or a septic tank) or a pit toilet with a ventilation pipe.In 2013 62% percent of households had access to a flush toilet connected to either the public sewerage system or a septic tank. 15% has access to a pit latrine with a ventilation pipe and 16% has access to a pit latrine without a ventilation pipe.Four percent of households reported that they did not have access to sanitation of any kind. The survey noted that “the percentage of households that continued to live without proper sanitation facilities had been declining consistently between 2002 and 2013”.However, the general secretary of the Cape Town based Social Justice Coalition, Phumeza Mlungwana, told Africa Check that Radebe’s numbers lacked important context.“The claim doesn’t say anything about the condition of the toilet or the experience of using it or whether the toilet is functional and clean,” she said.For the first time, the 2013 General Household Survey included questions about problems experienced by households that share sanitation facilities. Statistics provided by Stats SA showed that 3,209,048 households (22.4%) reported sharing toilets facilities.The main problems these households experienced included poor hygiene (25.6%), poor lighting (25.1%), concern about physical safety while using the toilets (22%) and finding the toilet pit or chamber full (21.8%).The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of people aged 20 years and older who had no education, or had completed some primary school below grade 7, had decreased from 19.3% in 2009 to 16.2% in 2013.Radebe’s claim is supported by Stats SA’s 2014 mid-year population estimates . It showed that life expectancy increased by 9.1 years from 52.1 in 2005 to 61.2 years in 2014.Deputy executive director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute , Francois Venter, told Africa Check that the general consensus was that life expectancy in South Africa had been driven up by the rollout of antiretroviral therapy.“If you stop someone from dying in their 20s, 30s and 40s with ARVs, you bump up the average age at death significantly,” he said.“It is possible other things contributed – fresh water, less under-nutrition, expanded vaccine programmes – but that doesn’t cause such a dramatic change.”The National Student Financial Aid Scheme’s annual reports show that they provided funding worth R2.5-billion in 2008/09 A spokesman for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, Kagisho Mamabolo, told Africa Check that R9.2-billion worth of funding was provided in 2014. However, this excluded an additional R1-billion which was provided by the Department of Higher Education and Training to cover funding shortfalls in 2013 and 2014.The scheme provides funding to students that qualify according to a financial means test . Students are required to start repaying their loans once they start earning a salary of R30,000 or more per year, at an initial rate of 3% of their annual salary.Both students and universities have raised concerns that there is not enough funding to assist financially needy students. Earlier this year Wits University’s Student Representative Council was reported to have raised R2-million to assist students that did not receive funding from the scheme.Research by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit at the University of Cape Town, among others, showed that poverty as measured by income declined slightly between 1993 and 2012.To a large degree, the decline could be attributed to state spending on social grants, said Lauren Royston, director of research and capacity at the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI).Another tool whereby poverty can be measured showed an even greater reduction over this period . The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) takes into account more than income. It scores nine factors, such as school enrolment, nutritional levels and access to basic services that include electricity, sanitation and water.However, the index suffers from two limitations, former SERI researcher Michael Clark pointed out. First, it relies heavily on government statistics. The index also does not measure the quality of basic services.Despite the decrease achieved, Royston said South Africans must be mindful that poverty remains deep and widespread and that inequality has increased This claim is a bit nonsensical as it neither proves nor confirms anything, said the head of Wits University’s School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw. “One, we are compelled to pay taxes and two, to judge the budget in nominal terms doesn’t tell us much.”Rossouw said a more useful metric is to compare the budget with the gross national product (GDP) in a particular year. South Africa’s budget comprised 28.9% of GDP in the 1992/93 financial year , the highest this ratio was from 1993 to 2012. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12 it averaged 27.2%. In 2013 the ratio reached 33.2% There is a cause for concern when state expenditure grows faster than the economy, said Rossouw, as he has pointed out as co-author of a journal article before . However, state expenditure slowed in the fourth quarter of last year , giving some credence to the state’s promise to curb spending.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Just in time for Halloween, Gov. Chris Christie cautioned New Hampshire voters last week to avoid the \"horror movie\" that New Jerseyans have lived through.Here’s how the Republican governor summed up that film’s plot: Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending, leading the Garden State to lose private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009.\"See, look at what happened to us. From 2000 to 2009, we had a jobless decade: more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on Jan. 1, 2000 than were there on Dec. 31, 2009,\" Christie said Wednesday at a campaign event for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State.\"A jobless decade under Democratic leadership, because what did they do?\" the governor went on. \"Raise taxes, increase regulation, raised fees, and during that period of time, spending went up an average of 16 percent a year.\"The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs, but he’s wrong to attribute that reduction only to tax and fee hikes, regulatory changes and state spending increases. Christie failed to note the impact of the recession, which coincided with the deepest losses of private-sector jobs. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts told us \"the Governor’s comments are factual and the record of job loss AND economic malaise in the decade dominated by Democratic leaders, who raises taxes, fees and burdensome regulation, speaks for itself.\"First, let’s break down the job figures.According to seasonally adjusted figures from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state had 3,366,100 private-sector jobs in December 1999 and 3,211,100 in December 2009.That represents a net loss of 155,000 private-sector jobs over the decade. During the same time period, New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector.But the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009 -- the height of the recession. The recession technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.After five consecutive years of private-sector job gains, New Jersey lost 107,900 jobs in 2008 and 117,000 in 2009.Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton, called Christie’s comparison \"extremely unfair.\"\"It's an extremely unfair comparison, since Jan. 1 2000 was the peak of the late-90s boom and Dec. 31 2009 was close to the trough of a terrible recession,\" Holzer said in an e-mail.\"There is no question that the recession contributed, and is likely the dominant effect,\" Holzer added. \"When you go from the strongest labor market in the past 40 years to the weakest one in 80 years, there will be a lot of job loss, and that was true in every state in the country.\"But Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, told us another factor was how New Jersey’s private-sector job gains preceding the recession lagged behind the nation’s growth rate.\"The reasons for that weak performance compared are complex, but they include the loss of competitiveness of the state in terms of attracting, retaining and growing private sector investment and employment,\" Seneca said in an e-mail.\"How much of this loss in competitiveness was due to taxes, regulations, other business costs, and a perceived unfriendly business climate cannot be easily determined, but by the mid years of the decade this deterioration in competitiveness had manifested itself in weak job growth.\"Our rulingAt a campaign event in New Hampshire last week, Christie claimed New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending.The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs: New Jersey lost 155,000 jobs between December 1999 and December 2009. But the reasons behind those job losses are complex and Christie failed to acknowledge the impact of the recession, which coincided with the bulk of the job losses. We rate the statement Half True.

            "[Evidences]:Amidst unprecedented security measures, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma delivered his tenth State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2017. We fact-checked his speech.EnergyClaim “To date, nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have the electricity.\" Verdict correctSouth Africa’sdevelopment indicatorsshowed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further233,455 were connected in 2014/15and231,012 were connected in 2015/16. Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released.Zuma’s claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016.As of 2016,90,3% of South African householdshad access to electricity for lighting. - Kate WilkinsonEducationClaim \"Among the participating countries [in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in mathematics and 90 points in science.\" Verdict correctThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science.Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested.The 2015 study found that South Africa’s Grade 9 pupils recorded the “biggest positive change”. There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics.The report goes on to note that “South Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015”.While South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa’s Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate WilkinsonSouth African pupils not ‘second worst in the world’ in maths & scienceClaim “Government also settled all debt owed by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students.” Verdict misleadingThe media unit of theNational Student Financial Aid Scheme(NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check toalengthy statement issued by the scheme earlier this year. It stated that “the historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved”.However, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university.First, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students.“Students who are still studying, dropped out or graduated within the stipulated academic years” can have these loan payments effected, the NSFAS statement said.Second, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students’ previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015.Third, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students’ academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meetgraduation requirements during their final year of study.Finally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or “capital” amount owed by the student to the university.Kagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students’ historic debt.NSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand’s NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that “some outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS”.As such, the “historical debt” has not been “settled” but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading.- Vinayak BhardwajClaim \"A total of 173 inappropriate [schools] have been eradicated since 2011.\" Verdict correctThe department of basic education replaces unsafe and “inappropriate” school structures under theAccelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative(Asidi) programme which started in 2011.As of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced,a department presentation to the select committee on basic educationshowed. At the time of Zuma’s speech, the department’s figures showed that173 had been replaced. Thelatest figuredisplayed on the department’s website puts the number of schools at 174.The programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially,496 schoolswere identified as “inappropriate structures”. Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14.- Kate WilkinsonEmploymentClaim “In terms of the 2015 to 2016 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management levels amounted to 72%, while African representation was at 10%.

The latest figures were provided by the department of environmental affairs in a September 2016media release. This was confirmed to Africa Check by departmental spokesman, Albi Modise.Between January and August 2016, 702 rhinos were poached countrywide, compared to 796 rhinos between January and July 2015 and a total of 1,175 rhino poaching incidents for the whole year, as recorded by theGlobal Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.While this does indicate a decline in the incidents of poached rhinos (40 fewer incidents were recorded in 2015 than in 2014), this is a relatively small decline when compared to the steady increase in poaching incidents since 2008.Africa Check will only be able to verify this claim once the 2016 figures have been released.- Gopolang MakouYear Recorded incidents 2008 83 2009 122 2010 333 2011 448 2012 668 2013 1,004 2014 1,215 2015 1,175CrimeClaim “Within the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit completed 389 forfeiture cases to the value of R349 million.” Verdict correctFollowing a successful investigation or prosecution,the money that is recovered by the statefrom freezing orders is referred to as the value of “completed forfeitures”.The National Prosecuting Authority’s latestannual reportshows that 389 forfeiture cases were completed by the Asset Forfeiture Unit during 2015/2016, like the president said.These completed cases were valued at R349.5 million, exceeding the R210 million that was projected to be recovered by R139.5 million. The annual report credits a focus on high-value cases, improved investigations and “the increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture” for the better-than-projected performance.The table below shows how the 2015/16 results compare to previous years:Financial year Value of completed forfeitures 2009/10 R185 million 2010/11 R212 million 2011/12 R164 million 2012/13 R119 million 2013/14 R296.4 million 2014/15 R1,939 million 2015/16 R349.5 million- Gopolang MakouClaim \"Last year, I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years.\" Verdict correctZuma prefaced this claim by saying that collusion by cartels “squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists”.It is likely that the president was referring to the proclamationsigned in Maylast year which insertedsection 73A into and amended section 74of the existingCompetition Act.The actual amendment act was passed by parliament in 2009, but various provisions of the amendment have been signed into effect periodically,director in the competition practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr,Lara Granville, explained to Africa Check.This amendment act introduced provisions to deal with “other practices that tend to prevent or distort competition in the market for any particular goods or services”, Granville said. Additionally, the act brings about provisions to hold personally accountable those individuals who “cause firms to engage in cartel conduct”.Thepenalties for these offencesare a fine “not exceeding R500,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment”.However, the new penalties could deter people from coming forward with information about collusion, Granville said. “While criminalisation may be an effective deterrent to cartel conduct, it may prevent people blowing the whistle about cartels to the competition tribunal due to fear of prosecution.”- Vinayak BhardwajClaim “Compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98%.” Verdict correctSpeaking about fighting crime, Zuma said one of government’s strategies “is to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again”.The department of correctional services’2015/16 annual reportshows that 51,307 of the 51,937 people (98.78%) released during that period complied with the conditions of their release.However, there are problems with this narrow reading of the figures, the director of the penal programme at theLawyers for Human Rights, Clare Ballard, pointed out to Africa Check.“The ‘compliance’ that the president refers to relates to policing aspects of parole,” Ballard told Africa Check. That is, whether the parolee is at home when supposed to and whether the person is at home or work at a certain time, Ballard explained.The number doesn’t capture opportunities to help parolees escape a life of crime, by receiving drug counselling or career advice.Furthermore, offenders serving life sentences experience significant delays in being granted parole, Ballard explained.South Africaintroduced minimum mandatory sentencesin 1997. In certain instances of rape and with certain types of murders the perpetrator must receive a sentence of life imprisonment, unless there are “substantial and compelling circumstances” that justify a lesser sentence.“The department is clearly overwhelmed by the bottleneck that the minimum sentences have created,” Ballard told Africa Check. Her calculations show that South Africa has more offenders serving life sentences than ever before.“We represent hundreds of life offenders all over the country whose parole application processes have been delayed by years and years, simply because of systemic poor management of the process on the part of the parole boards, the national council of correctional services, and the minister, who has the final say on whether a life offender may be released,” she added.- Vinayak BhardwajHealthClaim “The department of social development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities - in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, the Free State and Eastern Cape.” Verdict correctThenational drug master planis South Africa’s plan for reducing alcohol and substance abuse, spearheaded by theCentral Drug Authority, the body responsible for itsmonitoring and implementation.According to the plan, the departments of social development and health will work together toprovide inpatient treatment facilities at community and tertiary levels.In a2016 parliamentary meeting, the deputy chairperson of the central drug authority, David Bayever, said that R150 million had been secured from treasury to build 4 public treatment centres in provinces that previously did not have these facilities: the Northern Cape, Free State, Limpopo (which, at the time, was completed but not functioning) and the Eastern Cape (which, at the time, was already functioning).National spokesman for the department of social development, Lumka Oliphant, told EWN and Africa Check that a treatment centre in the North West province has since been completed but that the centres in the Northern Cape, Free State as well as Limpopo (contradicting the parliamentary presentation) are still under construction.A year ago, the department said in amedia statementthat the Limpopo facility had already been completed. Africa Check called theSeshego Hospitalnear Polokwane,where the facility is situatedand confirmed that the building has been erected but the centre is currently not operational.Africa Check also made calls to thecentres in the North West(one located at theTaung Provincial Hospitaland another located at theWitrand Psychiatric Hospitalin Potchefstroom). From our calls, we gathered that the Witrand centre is currently open but the Taung facility is not yet operational.Further questions to Oliphant asking when these facilities were expected to be completed and operational were unanswered at the time of publication.(Note: We will update this report when she gets back to us.)- Gopolang Makou & Katleho SekhothoSouth African students from the University of Cape Town listen to Western Cape premier Helen Zille during a meeting at the university in May 2011.

In fact, his statement contained two errors.Africa Check asked the National Empowerment Fund (NEF), a government mandated fund tasked with facilitating economic equality and transformation in South Africa, for the research Zuma’s claim was based on. They provided the organisation’s 2017 submission to parliament’s standing committee on finance.The research contained in the submission only looked at a “sample analysis of the top 17 financial services companies by market capitalisation as listed on the JSE” - not the top 100 companies, as Zuma held.The research refers to 31 December 2016 and was conducted by Intellidex , a South African capital markets and financial services research house.The submission made no reference to black-ownership of the JSE equalling 10%.“The study shows that the financial service sector companies have achieved an average of 6% against the direct equity target of 10%,” the NEF told Africa Check. - Kate WilkinsonREAD: Black ownership on SA’s stock exchange - what we know\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Rhode Island hasn't always done a good job of promoting itself as a tourist destination.During the 1980s, the state created catchy ads touting Rhode Island as \"the biggest little state in the Union,\" yet didn't invest money to run them outside the Ocean State. Other slogans such as \"America's First Resort\" and \"Our People Make Us Great\" never really caught on. (We couldn't even remember them. We had to look them up.)So it seemed plausible when Mark Brodeur, director of the state's tourism division, told The Journal that Rhode Island's current tourism budget is $720,000, which he said is less than 10 percent of the $11 million that, on average, other states spend promoting tourism.But we wanted to know whether the level is really that low, especially if you factor in Rhode Island's small size.Our first stop was a call to Brodeur's office, where we asked for the source of his numbers. He wasn't available for an immediate answer so we did some digging on our own.New Hampshire's Division of Travel & Tourism Development had no trouble coming up with numbers. Spokesman Tai Freligh e-mailed us a January 2010 report from the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group in Washington, D.C., that surveyed tourism budgets for 2008 to 2009.It reports that Rhode Island ranked 48th out of 48 states when it came to spending money on tourism promotion. (The report had no data for Massachusetts or New Jersey.) It listed the median state expenditure for state tourism offices as nearly $11.8 million, the \"average\" Brodeur was apparently referring to.Ten percent of $11.8 million would be $1.18 million. The $720,000 Rhode Island spends is, in fact, less than 10 percent of that (8.5 percent, in fact). So far so good.Then the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, at Brodeur's request, sent us statistics, citing U.S. Travel as the source, that seemed more complete.According to the newer figures for the now-complete 2010 fiscal year, Rhode Island again ranked dead last on the total amount spent. Second from the bottom was Connecticut, which cut its tourism spending from $5.7 million for the 2009 fiscal year to $981,538 the following year.The median amount spent by a state was $10.2 million. Even if Rhode Island was spending $1 million promoting tourism, we would still be 10 percent below the norm, according to the numbers Brodeur's office sent us.Brodeur's statement continued to ring true.However, when we adjusted the numbers to account for Rhode Island's size, it revealed a different story.But first, for the benefit of people who are savvy in math, we have to nitpick.The \"average\" state tourism budget numbers that we've been citing ($11.8 million in 2009 and $10.2 million in 2010) aren't really averages. They're medians -- or the amounts spent by the two states in the middle of the list, as ranked by the amount spent. (The true average in both years is actually higher -- $13.5 million in 2010, for example -- because a few states such as Hawaii and California spent a disproportionately higher amount.)So far, the distinction hasn't mattered. Whether you talk about average or median, Rhode Island's spending is 10 percent below either figure.Now let's talk about per person (also known as per capita) spending.We divided each state expenditure by the state's population, using U.S. Census Bureau estimates for July 1, 2009.Suddenly our ranking improves, but not by much.For 2010, Rhode Island was fifth from the bottom, at 68 cents per person. Only Ohio, Indiana, New York and Connecticut spent less.But the amount wasn't low enough for Brodeur's statement to be accurate. According to our calculations, based on the numbers provided by the EDC, states, on average, spent $4.69 per person promoting tourism. The median was $2.40 per person.Ten percent of the average spent would be 47 cents. Ten percent of the median spent would be 24 cents.At 68 cents, we were well above both those amounts.When Brodeur says that Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism, that's true only if you ignore each state's population. Once that is factored into the equation, no matter which \"average\" you look at, his statement is wrong. But in the end, Brodeur's broader point that, compared with other states, Rhode Island spends very little promoting tourism is correct, especially when you take into consideration the fact that Rhode Island's tourism office had a budget of nearly $3 million in 1994.So Brodeur gets an \"I survived the Truth-O-Meter\" T-shirt and a ruling of Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: COVID-19 vaccines do not alter a recipient’s DNA and U.S. FDA does not list death as a side effect\n",
            "[Evidences]:Posts are circulating on social media which claim to show how harmful COVID-19 vaccines are by listing 22 ingredients allegedly present in the vaccine. In addition, the posts claim that the vaccines contain nanotechnology and modify DNA, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists death as a side effect. These claims are false. The posts refer to the U.S. FDA and provide a UK government link at the end. This check will therefore focus on the four vaccines approved for Emergency Use Authorization in the United States and granted temporary Authorization under Regulation 174 by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (U.S. only) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (UK only). At the time of publication of this article in March 2021, there was no COVID-19 vaccine that had been fully approved by the FDA in the United States or given full market authorization by the MHRA in the United Kingdom (here,here,here,here). These COVID-19 vaccines do not modify DNA, the FDA does not list death as a side effect for them and the vaccines contain only one of the ingredients listed. Along with the nanotechnology in mRNA vaccines, it is not harmful. Examples of the posts, which list ingredients including antifreeze, aluminum, formaldehyde, aborted cow blood, human blood and Polysorbate 80, can be seenhereandhere. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are listed in a fact sheet on the FDA’s websitehere. The ingredients are mRNA (messenger RNA), lipids, potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate and sucrose. Kit Longley, a spokesperson for Pfizer, told Reuters via email that, as seen in the above list, none of the ingredients listed in the social media posts is used in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A fact sheet, seen on the FDA’s websitehere, shows that the ingredients of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are mRNA, lipids, cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate and sucrose. This list does not contain any of the ingredients in the social media posts. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ingredients are listed on the UK government website as ChAdOx1-S recombinant, L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, polysorbate 80, ethanol, sucrose, sodium chloride, disodium edetate dihydrate, water for injections (here). Dr. Sean Elias from the University of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine team told Reuters via email that, as is visible in the ingredients list, “Polysorbate 80 is in the vaccine as a listed ingredient. None of the others [listed in the social media post] are relevant.” The social media posts describe polysorbate-80 as follows: “causes cancer, emulsifier that opens the blood brain barrier so the aluminum nano particles can get in.” Elias for the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine team explained that polysorbate 80 is in fact “commonly used in many food stuffs as an emulsifier [helps ingredients mix together] and in health products as a surfactant [reduces surface tension between ingredients].” “In medicines it works in a similar way to stabilise the liquid for injection. The volume used in vaccines is a fraction of that used in other products,” Dr. Elias said. This description from the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine team matches the findings of a previous Reuters fact check, visiblehere. Polysorbate 80 is widely used safely in the food industry (here,here) and in other vaccines: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists 17 common vaccines which have polysorbate 80 as an ingredienthere. An expert group at the European Medicines Agency has categorized the danger of polysorbate 80 as “very low” (here). The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine ingredients, as listed on a fact sheet on the FDA’s websitehere, include: recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, citric acid monohydrate, trisodium citrate dihydrate, ethanol, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HBCD), polysorbate-80 and sodium chloride. The only ingredient included in this list and the list on social media is polysorbate 80, which is described above. Reuters has previously debunked claims that dead tissue from human aborted fetuses and aluminum, both listed in the social media posts, are used in the COVID-19 vaccines: (here,here). Reuters Fact Check has also tackled safety concerns about other ingredients listed in the social media posts that are sometimes used in small amounts in vaccines (here,here). Many of these ingredients are also explained by the FDAhereand on the Oxford University Vaccine Knowledge project websitehere. The social media posts allege that the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines “works as a genetic scissor that modifies your DNA in deep.” Reuters has debunked false claims that vaccines will alter the recipients’ DNAhere,hereandhere. The CDC says that a COVID-19 vaccine will not alter the recipient’s DNA, explaining that “the mRNA from a COVID-19 vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. This means the mRNA cannot affect or interact with our DNA in any way” (here). An article by the Vaccine Alliance Gavi (here) says that “mRNA isn’t the same as DNA, and it can’t combine with our DNA to change our genetic code. It is also relatively fragile, and will only hang around inside a cell for about 72 hours before being degraded” (here). The article explains that mRNA are strands of genetic code that provide instructions that our cellular machinery needs to assemble the proteins we need to function. The mRNA vaccines deliver mRNA into our cells, which the cells use to manufacture a viral protein: the coronavirus ‘spike’ protein. When our immune cells encounter this protein they respond, which should protect recipients against future COVID-19. When our cells have made the viral protein, it is on their surfaces, allowing passing immune cells to spot it and respond. The posts claim that the FDA warns that death is a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccines. The side effects of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved by the FDA for temporary use (Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen) are listed by the FDAhere,hereandhere. The FDA does not include death on any of these lists. The FDA does say that the side effects listed may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccines, which are still being studied in clinical trials, adding, “serious and unexpected side effects may occur.” The social media posts claim that the “RNA vaccine contains nano technology.” As explainedhereby Reuters in a previous fact-check article, the term “nano,” is simply a unit of size: the general definition of “nanoparticle” is a small particle that is between 1 and 100 nanometers in size (here). The lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine protect and transport the vaccine component to the right place in cells (here). Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use lipid nanoparticles as mRNA carriers (here), while the Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are vector vaccines that do not use this technology (here).\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Gov. Scott Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as \"one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke minced no words on Equal Pay Day, April 8, 2014, charging that Gov. Scott Walker has left women behind in the Wisconsin workplace. \"Following Scott Walker's repeal in 2012 of protections against gender discrimination, Wisconsin is now one of just five states without an equal pay law,\" the Madison School Board member said in a media statement. Burke pledged to reinstate Wisconsin’s 2009 Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that in Wisconsin, \"a woman only earns $0.80 for every dollar a man earns, and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies too.\" The former Trek Bicycle executive also sent supporters an email saying that due to Walker’s action, Wisconsin now is \"without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck.\" In bringing up Walker’s repeal of the 2009 law, Burke echoed Democratic Party attacks that Republicans are conducting a \"war on women.\" Is Burke on target in saying that Wisconsin women are working without an anti-discrimination safety net? Before we dive in, we should note that several federal laws give Wisconsin women a way to pursue cases of pay discrimination. It seems clear, though, that Burke was talking about state-level laws that are separate from the federal laws. So that’s what we’ll examine. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to research posted online by the National Conference of State Legislatures, which concluded that Wisconsin, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah lack equal-pay laws. That nugget was picked up by the Washington Post and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in March 2014. How did the group come to that conclusion? The NCSL told us they searched an online legal research service for terms such as \"equal pay\" and got no hits for Wisconsin. But Wisconsin has a longstanding law by another name, the state Fair Employment Act, which explicitly prohibits gender-based employment discrimination \"in promotion (and) compensation paid for equal or substantially similar work.\" Attorneys on both sides of discrimination cases told us the state’s Fair Employment Act allows people who believe they’ve faced pay discrimination to seek back wages and legal fees from their employers through a state administrative hearing process. So what was the 2009 law passed by Democrats then in full control of the Capitol? That legislation, approved by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, sought to expand the state penalties employers could face if found guilty of discrimination against women and other protected groups on pay or other employment issues. Democrats, women’s professional groups and plaintiff’s lawyers had argued that the Fair Employment law needed more teeth (while Republican opponents said businesses would see more frivolous lawsuits). So the 2009 bill allowed persons to sue in court -- and get compensatory and punitive damages -- after they had exhausted their administrative cases in the state Department of Workforce Development. But that 2009 law -- the one repealed in 2012 by Walker and Republicans -- was a fairly narrow one focused on tougher enforcement of existing protections for women and other groups. It did not establish a new set of equal-pay protections -- those already were in the Fair Employment law, where they have been since 1982 and where they remained even after the 2012 repeal. \"The bill will help all workers who are already protected under Wisconsin’s Fair Employment Law to fight these kinds of discrimination,\" state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), a co-sponsor, said in 2009. She added: \"The bill does not create any protected new groups, just backs up those who, despite current law, are still unfairly denied work, fired from work or compensated less than others for the same work.\" All of that history undermines Burke’s sweeping claim. States have changed laws There’s another angle here. It’s tougher on employees to win under Wisconsin law than in some other states where workers can turn to state statutes written more explicitly to require equal pay for equal work, said Janet Heins, managing partner of a Mequon law firm that represents workers. States have adopted those measures in recent years under the heading of \"Equal Pay\" laws. One result: some states, mirroring federal laws, require only that employees prove unequal pay for equal work instead of showing that employers had a discriminatory motive, said Heins. Ronald Stadler, who defends employers accused of discrimination, agreed but noted that the 2009 Wisconsin law changes did not alter the standard for proving discrimination. Instead, those changes focused on adding remedies such as punitive damages that are already in federal laws. Wisconsin sought in its 2009 \"equal pay enforcement\" changes to make the state process more appealing and available to employees, in part because its more affordable than filing a federal action. Many state-law claimants proceed without an attorney. In Stadler’s view, the bottom line is that Wisconsin women have a state-law course of action on pay discrimination despite what he called a semantic difference. \"We don’t have an ‘equal pay act,’ but we have a ‘fair employment act’ that says you can’t have one male and one female at different pay rates for same job,\" Stadler, a Milwaukee attorney, said. Heins thinks it’s a \"tricky\" question to answer, but believes it’s technically accurate to say there’s no state \"equal pay\" law. Without tougher remedies, some would-be plaintiffs may not be pursuing state claims because it does not make financial sense, Heins said. Burke portrays the 2009 changes as major. But they were repealed before that could be determined, Heins and Stadler said. Heins said that workers’ attorneys may have gained a bit more leverage over employers to settle more cases under the changes. The number of cases that go to state administrative law hearings is not large and most are settled privately, are withdrawn or dismissed for various reasons, according to numbers provided by state Workforce Development officials. In gender pay cases from January 2011 to April 2014 that got to the hearing stage, judges found discrimination in three cases, no discrimination in one and another 33 were settled privately. About 35 other complaints were dismissed, withdrawn or the judges affirmed an earlier finding of no probable cause. Earlier ratings We examined similar statement by Democrats in March 2012 when Republicans were repealing the 2009 change. State Rep. Cory Mason (D-Racine) said the GOP bill would repeal a law that ensures \"that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job.\" We rated that Mostly False, noting the 2009 law did not ensure pay equity, but rather gave discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. And we rated False a claim by Kathleen Falk, Democrat running for governor, that Wisconsin women facing pay discrimination \"can’t do something about it\" under the repeal bill passed by Republicans. We noted that women suffering pay discrimination could still file a state or federal complaint in an effort to be made whole. And they could still seek larger monetary damages by suing in federal court. As for Burke’s claim, there’s a case to be made that Walker’s 2012 action filed down some of the (potentially) sharp new teeth put into the law in 2009. But Burke goes much further, saying that thanks to the governor, Wisconsin is \"without an equal pay law.\" This is highly misleading. Our rating Burke said that Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as \"just one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck.\" But while Walker reversed an attempt to toughen up Wisconsin law, its protections against gender discrimination in workplace pay date back decades. The governor’s 2012 action left those in place, albeit without tougher penalties for employers. We rate Burke’s claim False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Scholarship scheme has been launched in 2014 to provide scholarship to pursue technical education\n",
            "[Evidences]:An infographic published by the government on the 48-month portal makes claims regarding scholarship to persons with disability. Here is a fact check of these claims. An infographic published by the government on the 48-month portal makes claims regarding the government’s commitment to social justice. Titled as Shikshit Bharat, Sakham Bharat, the infographic mentions issue of inclusive education for the empowerment of ‘Divyangs’ or the persons with disability. There are four claims made by the government and here is a fact check of these claims. Claim: Scholarship scheme to pursue Technical Education The first claim by the government is that, scholarship scheme was launched in 2014 to provide scholarship to pursue technical education. The compendium of all the schemes of the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities has the information on pre-matric & post-matric scholarships. There is no mention of a specific scholarship scheme for those who wish to pursue technical education. Scholarships were being provided for technical education by NHFDC (The National Handicapped Finance and Development Corporation). The NHFDC which is under the ‘Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities’ functions as an apex institution for extending financial support for education, employment, and entrepreneurship of the persons with disabilities through state channelizing agencies nominated by the state governments. NHFDC was set up in 1997 as a not for profit company. The scholarship scheme implemented by the NHFDC has been there for quite some time and was not launched in 2014. The NHFDC implements the Scholarship Scheme (Trust Fund) and Scholarship Scheme (National Fund), for award of scholarship to students with disabilities pursuing Higher and Technical education. This scheme was there even during the UPA government. There were 2000 fresh beneficiaries of this scheme in 2013-14 and a similar number in 2017-18. Under this scheme, complete tuition fee was provided in case of government institutions and a similar amount for private institutions. The monthly maintenance amount was at least Rs 2500 per month and other allowances for books/stationery were also provided. As per information on the NHFDC website, this scheme was discontinued in December 2017. However, the NDA government launched a ‘Saksham Scholarship’ scheme in November 2014 under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to support 1000 differently abled students to pursue technical education in a year. The amount of scholarship is tuition Fee of Rs 30,000 or at actual, whichever is less and Rs. 2000 per month for 10 months as incidental charges each year. While it is true that the NDA government launched a new scheme for scholarships to the disabled, they have closed down an earlier scheme which was catering to a greater number of beneficiaries with a greater amount of tuition fee & maintenance amount. Claim 1: Scholarship scheme has been launched in 2014 to provide scholarship to pursue technical education Fact: The scholarship scheme for disabled people to pursue technical education existed even during the UPA. The NDA government only closed down the existing scheme and launched a new scheme ‘SAKSHAM’ under the MHRD, reducing the number of beneficiaries and the amount of scholarship. Hence the claim is MISLEADING. Claim 2: 1000 scholarships per annum are available Fact: The scholarship scheme for disabled people to pursue technical education existed even during the UPA. The NDA government only closed down the existing scheme and launched a new scheme ‘SAKSHAM’ under the MHRD. The new scheme is providing 1000 scholarships per annum. But it has to be noted that this number is less than the number of beneficiaries and the amount of scholarship provided under the old scheme. Hence the claim is MISLEADING. Claim 3: 30,000 rupees is provided towards tuition fee and 20,000 as contingency allowance. Fact: The ‘Saksham’ scheme under the MHRD provides tuition Fee of Rs 30,000 or at actual, whichever is less and Rs. 2000 per month for 10 months as incidental charges each year. However it has to be noted that this amount is less than what was provided under the old scheme. Hence the claim is MISLEADING. Claim: Establishment of Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) The fourth claim is that Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) was established. Indian Sign Language Research and training Center (ISLRTC) is an autonomous organization under the administrative and financial control of Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities. A brief history on the ISLRTC website tells us that the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-2012) acknowledged that the needs of people with hearing disabilities had been relatively neglected and envisaged the development of a sign language research and training center, to promote and develop sign language and training of teachers and interpreters. The Finance Minister announced the setting up of ISLRTC in the Budget speech of 2010-11. In 2011, the government announced the establishment of the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Center (ISLRTC) as an autonomous center of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), Delhi. In 2013, the center at IGNOU was closed. In April 2015, after the NDA came to power, the government decided to integrate ISLRTC with the regional center of the Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing Handicapped (AYJNIHH) at Delhi. However, the Deaf community protested this decision due to the different perspectives and goals of ISLRTC and AYJNIHH. The protests and meetings with the ministers resulted in the Union Cabinet approving the setting up of ISLRTC as an independent society. An order to this effect was issued on 28th September, 2015, leading to the establishment of ISLRTC. Claim: Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) established. Fact: ISLRTC was first established as an autonomous center in IGNOU in 2011 which was later closed down. It was established as an independent society in 2015 by the current government. Hence, the claim is only PARTLY TRUE. This story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

            "claim [Claim]: \"57% of the jobs created\" in Austin \"from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Austin isn’t as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: \"Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.\" We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adler’s attention, which didn’t speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. \"From 2009 to 2013,\" the article said, \"almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\" That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning. According to the entries, the living wage is \"the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year).\" To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firm’s own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, you’re going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But it’s also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage. The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but she’d need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSI’s Wright told us he didn’t have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didn’t pay the living wage for an adult with one child. Our ruling Adler said: \"57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.\" To be precise, that’s the estimated share of net jobs added in the multi-county Austin area (not Austin alone) pegged as having median wages less than the living wage for an adult with one child. Families vary in size, though, as do related living wages. We rate this statement, which lacks clarification, Mostly True.

            "[Evidences]:The Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa’s official opposition party, rules 26 municipalities in South Africa. They are aiming to add municipalities like Nelson Mandela Bay, Tshwane and Tlokwe to the list in the upcoming local government election.Their68-page manifestois titled “Change that moves South Africa forward again”. In the first pages, DA leader Mmusi Maimane spells out the DA’s vision for local government saying that “this document does not only make promises of a better future, it illustrates the progress we have already made in the municipalities we currently govern”.Here we evaluate are key claims in the DA’s manifesto about their past performance in local government. (Note: We aren’t able to fact-check promises but will keep an eye on whether they are fulfilled.)EmploymentClaim “More than 8.2 million South Africans do not have a job.” Verdict mostly-correctWhen the DAlaunched their manifesto on 23 April 2016, the latest available data on unemployment in South Africa was fromJuly to September 2015.That data showed that, according to the narrow definition. These people are unemployed but tried to find a job in the last four weeks. The latest data, from January to March 2016, shows thatthe number has risen to 5,714,000.The expanded definition of unemployment includes discouraged job-seekers. These are people who want to work but are not actively trying to find employment. According to the expanded definition, there were8,304,000 unemployed peoplein South Africa in July to September 2015. This figurerose to 8,927,000in the first quarter of 2016.READ: Unemployment statistics in South Africa explainedClaim “Estimates by the City [of Cape Town] found that 161,000 individuals, or 11.3% of the total workforce in Cape Town, were employed by the informal economy in 2015.” Verdict mostly-correctThe estimates of the number of Capetonians working in the informal economy were included in areport on Economic Performance Indicators for Cape Townfor the second quarter of 2015, the DA told Africa Check.The informal employment sector,as measured by Statistics South Africa(Stats SA), includes people informally employed, as well as people working in the formal sector or private households, but without a written contract or benefits such as medical aid or pension fund contributions.The DA’s claim is correct for the second quarter of 2015, Stats SA’s quarterly labour force survey shows.2015 Informal employees in City of Cape Town % of total employment Unemployment rate Jan-Mar 135,000 9.5% 23.5% April-June 161,000 11.3% 22.6% July-Sept 171,000 11.6% 21.9% Oct-Dec 175,000 11.6% 20.5%Source: Stats SAquarterly labour force survey(Jan-March 2016)But the size of Cape Town’s informal sector employment as a proportion of total employment is low relative to other metropolitan municipalities in South Africa,professor Dieter von Fintelof the Stellenbosch University’s economic department, told Africa Check.Von Fintel said that only Tshwane’s proportion was lower than Cape Town’s. In turn, South Africa has a comparatively low informal sector share when compared to many developing countries.Claim “Midvaal [has] the lowest unemployment rate in Gauteng.” Verdict correctThe DA said their claim is based on 2011 census data, which showed that the Midvaal local municipality’sunemployment rate was then at 18.8%. Compared to the 3 metropolitan municipalities and 6 other local municipalities in the Gauteng province, Midvaal had the lowest unemployment figures in 2011.Municipality Unemployment rate in 2011 Emfuleni 34.7% Westonaria 29.5% Ekurhuleni 28.8% Merafong City 27.2% Randfontein 27.1% Lesedi 25% City of Johannesburg 25% Mogale City 24.6% City of Tshwane 24.2% Midvaal 18.8%In 2001,the year after the DA first won Midvaal’s local government election,.Claim “Since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed South Africans through [the Expanded Public Works Programme].” Verdict correctIn support of the claim, DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme pointed Africa Check to a City of Cape Townmedia release from July 2015. It stated that “since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed residents through this programme”.This is backed up by the City of Cape Town’s annual reports, in which they reported creating 140,324 work opportunities between 2011/12 and 2014/15.(Note:As Africa Check has previously explained, the number of opportunities does not correspond to the number of people who have benefited from the programme. Someone can be employed on different projects in the programme at different times with each work period counted as a separate job opportunity.)Financial year Work opportunities reported 2011/12 26,403 2012/13 35,556 2013/14 38,305 2014/15 40,060 Total 140,324Source: City of Cape Town annual reportsClaim The City of Cape Town’s \"rate of unemployment\" was 20.5% in 2013/14. This was lower than three other \"major metros\", including the City of Tshwane (23.4%), Nelson Mandela Bay (30.6%) and the City of Johannesburg (27.9%). Verdict incorrectThe DA’s research unit told Africa Check that “upon closer inspection we found that the heading for the unemployment figuresthat appear in the bar graph on page 13of the manifesto is incorrect”.The unemployment data they cited was actually forOctober to December in 2015.That year the City of Cape Town’s narrow unemployment rate was 20.5% as claimed. However, the metropolitan municipality with thelowest unemployment rate was eThekwini at 15.9%.Municipality Official unemployment rate Expanded unemployment rate City of Cape Town 20.5% 21.8% Buffalo City 23.8% 27.3% Nelson Mandela Bay 30.6% 30.6% Mangaung 22.8% 29.2% eThekwini 15.9% 24.3% City of Joburg 27.9% 29.2% City of Tshwane 23.4% 27.4% Ekurhuleni 30.8% 33%Comparable unemployment data at metropolitan municipality level has only been released in Quarterly Labour Force Surveys since the beginning 2015. Prior to that, it was only available every ten years in the census.The DA referred to the incorrect information as a “formatting error” and said it was “deeply regretted”.The latest data, fromJanuary to March of 2016, shows that the City of Cape Town’s unemployment rate had increased to 21.1%. The metropolitan municipality with the lowest unemployment rate was again eThekwini at 18.8%.Pro-poor spendingClaim “In the 2014/15 financial year, the City of Cape Town spent 67% of its budget in poor communities.” Verdict incorrectGovernanceClaim “DA-run governments are recognised as among the best in South Africa by national government and a variety of other agencies.” Verdict correctThe DA told Africa Check that they base this claim on three different evaluations:the auditor-general’s reports from 2008/9 to 2013/4, as evaluated by the Dullah Omar Institute , a community law centre based at the University of Western Cape, with a research focus on multi-level government among others.the Government Performance Index , a metric compiled by the research and advocacy organisation Good Governance Africa ,the Municipal Financial Stability Index (MFSI), compiled by the Ratings Afrika agency.The Dullah Omar Institute publishes an annual Municipal Audit Consistency Barometer in which they categorise a municipality according to the audit outcome it most often achieved over the past 5 years, in this case over the period 2008/9 to 2013/4. There are five possible audit outcomes, listed here from best to worst:Unqualified with no findings (clean),Unqualified with findings,Qualified with findings,Adverse with findings, andDisclaimer with findings.According to the DA, it governs in 26 municipalities across four provinces: Gauteng and the Northern, Eastern and Western Cape. The Dullah Omar Institute’s report shows the DA mostly scored clean (unqualified with no findings) and unqualified opinions with findings between 2008/9 and 2013/4:Clean: 6 municipalities (City of Cape Town, George, Langeberg, Mossel Bay, Swartland and West Coast district)Unqualified with findings: 16 municipalities (Bergrivier, Bitou, Breede Valley, Cape Winelands district, Drakenstein, Eden district, Hessequa, Knysna, Laingsburg, Midvaal, Overberg district, Overstrand, Saldanha Bay, Stellenbosch, Theewaterskloof and Witzenberg)Qualified with findings: 1 municipality (Hantam)Disclaimer: 1 municipality (Baviaans)Not submitted: 2 municipalities (Swellendam and Karoo Hoogland).Theauditor-general’s report for 2014/15 on the outcome of municipal audits, released yesterday, showed that 21 DA-run municipalities achieved a clean audit, 3 an unqualified with findings opinion and 2 a qualified with findings opinion.But the auditor-general’s reports speak to financial governance and not necessarily all aspects of service delivery, Karen Heese, an economist at research organisationMunicipal IQtold Africa Check.Independent consultant to national and local governmentsDr Andrew Siddleexplained to Africa Check that the auditor-general’s reports show “three things only: the soundness of financial reporting, [a municipality’s] legislative compliance, and the soundness of its reporting on performance management”.When a municipality gets a “clean” report, it means that it has passed the test for all three of these elements - “nothing more, nothing less”.Nonetheless, “if a municipality passes the ‘clean’ test, then it may logically claim to be doing some things right, and that can be justifiably be interpreted as a reflection on its approach to governance”, Siddle added. As such, auditor-general reports “should be and are taken seriously”.As for theGovernment Performance Index, the DA told Africa Check that it shows that “12 out of the 20 best run municipalities in the country are governed by the DA, with 9 of them in the top 10. Good Governance Africa ranked the country’s 234 local and metropolitan municipalities according to 15 different criteria across three spheres of performance: administration, economic development and service delivery.”Africa Check verified the DA’s standing in the index. However, Heese cautioned against relying too much on the Government Performance Index as its measure of a municipality’s performance is based on limited information.Africa Check was unable to verify the DA’s claims about the Municipal Financial Stability Index produced byRatings Afrika. Analyst Charl Kocks said the data broken down by municipality was “proprietary” and we need to buy the report at a cost of R100,000 to access that.However, Kocks did confirm that the average score for theWestern Cape was 60 out of 100and that it was the highest scoring province in the country, as the DA claimed. However, he could not tell us how many of the 22 DA-run municipalities in the Western Cape were included in the index.Kocks explained that their ratings were based on municipalities complying with their requests for various categories of information. Whether or not all of the 30 municipalities in the Western Cape complied is unknown.Claim “The City of Cape Town has repealed over 300 [apartheid-era policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures].” Verdict correctTheDA manifesto promisesthat the party will create “a regulatory business environment that promotes growth and innovation”.One of the ways it says it will do so is by repealing “apartheid-era policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures which contradict our commitment to freedom and fairness and which pose barriers to economic development and job-creating growth”. In the City of Cape Town, the DA claimedit had already repealed“over 300 such policies”.Thefirst documentthe DA sent us contained only 261 such policies. The list included policies from post-1994 - such as the “Goodwood Policy on the erection of Wendy houses” (1997) and “Fencing guidelines for N1 City, Goodwood” (2001).In response, the DA said: “We do not believe the text suggests that the structure plans, bylaws and other procedures are all apartheid-era; indeed, a cursory look at the list should show that the policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures from the democratic era have also been repealed.”HealthClaim “The City of Cape Town runs six facilities dedicated to providing treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.” Verdict correctThe DAclaims in its manifestothat the City of Cape Town runs treatment centres “in accordance with the Matrix Model of treatment” in Delft South, Khayelitsha, Manenberg, Milnerton, Parkwood and Tafelsig.A leaflet provided to Africa Checkexplains that the Matrix Model is an intensive outpatient treatment programme developed in the US.Africa Check called the centres on the list and confirmed that they offer Matrix Model treatment. However, the internationalMatrix Institute on Addictionslists only two of the centresas officially accredited on its website.HousingClaim “The DA is making great strides compared to other metros in the country - as of February 2015, Nelson Mandela Bay had 50,000 outstanding title deeds” Verdict correctThe DA pointed us toa February 2015 parliamentary replyby the ministry of human settlements as proof.It showed that the Nelson Mandela Bay metro had by far the most title deeds yet to issue, followed by the City of Cape Town.Metro Outstanding title deeds on 20 February 2015 Buffalo City 5,835 Nelson Mandela Bay 50,934 Mangaung 5,190 Ekurhuleni Did not submit information City of Johannesburg None outstanding City of Tshwane 8,237 eThekwini 3,628 City of Cape Town 11,059The figure has since changed.Nelson Mandela Bay’s municipal manager, Mthubanzi Mnikitold Africa Check only 15,339 title deeds were outstanding as of 30 April 2016.

Read our report for a detailed explanation.The information is not yet publicly available, though.The Drakenstein municipality is located in the Western Cape and comprises the towns of Paarl and Wellington.Van Damme told Africa Check that the figures cited were supplied by the municipality. She provided a booklet which stated that “water losses in the Drakenstein municipality were an unacceptable 34% in 1999... Through a coordinated programme of action, the municipality reduced the water losses to 12.1% by 2013.”The municipality was however only formed in December 2000 when the Paarl and Wellington municipalities were amalgamated.Drakenstein municipality spokesman, Mart-Marié Haasbroek, told Africa Check that the figures shared by the DA were from the town of Paarl, located in the Drakenstein municipality. They could not be attributed to the municipality as a whole.“Before 2012, the statistics for the other towns in Drakenstein were estimated and are therefore less reliable and reflects more erratically. Data for Paarl has always been accurately measured,” said Haasbroek.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Getting companies to pay more in taxes is one of the pillars of Bernie Sanders’ plans for America. The extra revenue plays a key role in everything from universal health care, to tuition-free college, to rebuilding the nation’s aging water mains, bridges and highways. How much does he think is there? \"The largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens,\" Sanders tweeted April6, 2016. That’s a fair chunk of change, and we thought we’d see if it held up. By the way, there’s no single definition of a tax haven. The term covers both profits from overseas subsidiaries and the use of offshore accounts in places like Bermuda. The common thread is money is booked in places with lower taxes than the United States. The Sanders campaign directed us to a joint study from Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG, both left-leaning organizations. Their analysis began with the more than $2.1 trillion that Fortune 500 companies are holding in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes. When the foreign subsidiary of a U.S. multinational turns a profit, the money is taxed at the rate where the subsidiary is based. Uncle Sam doesn’t get a penny until the multinational brings the money home. That gets a little confusing because the money might actually be in the United States, but it isn’t on the books of the U.S. parent. In any event, for tax purposes, most of those funds are not formally repatriated or brought back to the United States. The logic is simple: Why pay a higher rate in the United States, formally as high as 35 percent, when you might be paying a fifth that much in a foreign country, such as Ireland? The Citizens for Tax Justice/US PIRG analysts looked at the 57 corporations that actually told regulators how big their tax bill would be if they brought the money home. \"These 57 companies would owe $184.4 billion in additional federal taxes,\" the report said. The analysts made some assumptions and applied the results to the companies that didn’t release this information. The total for all Fortune 500 companies combined? \"They would collectively owe $620 billion in additional federal taxes.\" We asked independent tax scholars what they thought of that estimate. Some of them said it was in the ballpark. Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, said Sanders might actually be underestimating. Harvey pointed to the foreign earnings that multinationals report as \"indefinitely reinvested.\" Officially, the total is about $2.3 trillion. But Harvey thinks that overlooks a lot of cash. \"The total unrepatriated foreign earnings would be even higher because companies like Apple and Pfizer do not label all undistributed foreign earnings as ‘indefinitely reinvested,’ \" Harvey said. \"If one assumes that U.S. multinational corporations have approximately $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of unrepatriated foreign earnings, and the average tax rate on most undistributed foreign earnings is less than 10 percent (in many cases close to 0 percent), then a $620 billion estimate is very reasonable, and may be low.\" Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff at the U.S. Congress'Joint Committee on Taxation, took a different approach, and reached approximately the same conclusion. Kleinbard took the Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate of how much revenue would come from a one-time 14 percent tax on those foreign earnings kept overseas. This is in fact what President Barack Obama has proposed in his latest budget. The net haul from that would be about $195 billion. Using that figure, Kleinbard estimated how much would come in if the rate were 35 percent, rather than 14 percent. \"You get to $488 billion,\" he said. \"That’s not perfect, because of how foreign tax credits (offsets to U.S. taxes) would have to be handled, but it’s the right ballpark.\" That’s less than the $620 billion Sanders cited, but as Kleinbard put it, \"it's a honkin' big number.\" The banking giant Credit Suisse estimated the total new revenues at $533 billion. Edmund Outslay, professor of taxation at Michigan State University, thinks Sanders overshot the mark. Outslay told PolitiFact that he questions a key assumption in the study behind Sanders’ number. The study estimates an average tax rate of 6 percent that all Fortune 500 companies are paying overseas today. Because any foreign tax bill is deducted from what a firm owes Washington, the lower the foreign tax rate, the higher the potential revenues for the United States. Outslay thinks 6 percent is unrealistic. \"Some studies I have seen estimate a foreign tax rate of about 16.5 percent,\" Outslay said. \"If this number is more accurate, the total tax to be gained (would be) $550 billion. At 25 percent, the net U.S. tax would only be $320 billion.\" Outslay himself leans more toward a $300 billion figure. In addition to thinking multinationals are paying a higher rate overseas, he also said \"in most cases, the foreign earnings are actually invested in bricks and mortar.\" Those dollars are not cash in the way Sanders talked about this. How the IRS would treat that money is unclear. All this leaves us with a range of estimates of the potential tax revenues, ranging from about $300 billion (Outslay), to $490 billion (Kleinbard), to $550 billion (Credit Suisse), to over $620 billion (Harvey). Our ruling Sanders said that if American multinational corporations had to pay taxes on the profits they made overseas, they would owe $620 billion. This is at the high end of the estimates we collected. Sanders also described the overseas holdings as cash. According to one expert we reached, a lot of that money might be invested in factories and other hard infrastructure and might not be available for tax collections. Still, the mid-range estimate from credible sources is in the $500 billion to $550 billion range. All the numbers cited were relatively high. We rate Sanders’ estimate Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “Each job created in Biden’s ‘infrastructure plan’ will cost the American people $850,000.” — Republican National Committee, in a tweet, April 19 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight President Biden’s $2.2 trillion infrastructure plan has come under attack from Republicans as being too expensive for the amount of jobs it creates. The tweet above puts the complaint in raw numbers — almost $1 million a job. The figure has also come up in the White House briefing room, with a reporter asking April 6: “I think that works out to something like $850,000 per job. Given that, are you open to ideas about a more targeted way — a cheaper way of achieving the same goal in terms of number of jobs created?” (Press secretary Jen Psaki did not address the figure.) It’s easy to see how this number was calculated. The plan is estimated to add between 2.6 million and 2.7 million jobs to the U.S. economy over 10 years. Divide the cost of the plan by 2.6 million and voila, you end up with $850,000. Advertisement Sounds simple. But according to Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, who originally produced the jobs figure, it’s simple-minded math. The Facts Regular readers will recall that Biden got in trouble when he stated, “Independent analysis shows that if we pass this plan, the economy will create 19 million jobs — good jobs, blue-collar jobs, jobs that pay well.” We gave that statement Two Pinocchios: The Moody’s report said that if the plan had not passed, the economy still would add 16.3 million jobs. So, at the end of 10 years, the economy is estimated to add an additional 2.6 million jobs with the infrastructure plan. But Zandi said that if you are calculating a cost per job, you would not just use the overall gain in jobs in the last year of a 10-year period. You would also have to look at how many additional jobs were added each year and then were carried over into the next year. Advertisement This is an economic term known as “job-year.” A job-year means simply one job for one year. For instance, a person who was hired in 2024 because of the infrastructure plan and stayed hired through 2030 would have worked for six “job-years.” When you look at Zandi’s spreadsheet of the difference in the number of jobs each year between implementing the infrastructure plan and not implementing it, you end up with this calculation: 2021: zero difference in jobs 2022: zero difference in jobs 2023: zero difference in jobs 2024: 1.4 million more jobs 2025: 2.5 million more jobs 2026: 2.8 million more jobs 2027: 2.9 million more jobs 2028: 2.9 million more jobs 2029: 2.8 million more jobs 2030: 2.6 million more jobs So, when you add that up, you end up with 17.9 million additional job-years over the decade. The last year, 2030, may have added 2.6 million more jobs to the economy, but many more people were working year after year, so it’s a different calculation if you want to know the cost per job. The RNC’s calculation is “seriously misleading,” Zandi said. “Take the ratio of the 10-year cost to the additional jobs created over the 10 years and the cost per job comes to $128,000,” he said. “And even this overstates things, as it doesn’t account for the increase in hours worked that would occur or inflation.” Advertisement Zandi added it was “more appropriate … to divide the $985 billion in cumulative budget deficits over the 10-year period by 17.9 million jobs. This results in a cost of $55,000 per job-year.” We should note that focusing on the cost per job created obscures the fact that the infrastructure plan is intended to create a better mix of high-quality jobs. Some economists would argue that it would not matter whether any additional jobs were added to the economy if the end result was better-paying, more sustainable jobs. “There is also the higher quality of the jobs created by the plan,” Zandi said. In 2009, President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers calculated that $1 billion worth of transportation spending would create 13,000 job-years — in other words, $76,923 per job-year. Adjusted for inflation, that would be about $96,500 today. Not all of Biden’s plan is for transportation spending, but that number falls right in the middle of Zandi’s estimate of $55,000 to $128,000 per job-year. Advertisement Sometimes politicians have blithely ignored job-years to inflate the number of possible jobs from a project. President Donald Trump, for instance, used to claim that the Keystone XL oil pipeline would create 28,000 construction jobs. In part he came up with that number by counting each construction worker as working a full year, even though they only were expected to be engaged for four- or eight-month periods. The State Department said that the 10,400 construction workers on the pipeline would work for a total of 3,900 job-years. “The facts are clear. Moody’s estimate says Biden would spend $2.2 trillion and only create 2.6 million jobs, something that Biden and his Administration repeatedly lied about ,” Zach Parkinson, RNC deputy communications director, said in a statement. “Other independent studies have already found Biden’s plan would cut workers’ wages and shrink the economy, while his business tax hike would kill American jobs and tax U.S. businesses at a higher rate than communist China does. Mark Zandi is claiming Joe Biden would spend ‘only’ $130,000 per year for each new job, and that’s hardly a good defense of Biden’s plan.” The Pinocchio Test We realize that the concept of “job-years” may be difficult to grasp, as the result is different from the total number of jobs added to the economy over time. But it’s an accepted method to calculate how much impact spending can have on employment, year after year. As the Keystone example shows, it’s also a way to express part-year jobs in annual numbers that are more easily compared. Advertisement The RNC came up with $850,000 by taking a one-year number — the number of additional jobs added to the economy over 10 years — and dividing it into 10 years of spending. But that spending has an annual impact on jobs for most of the decade, which is why using job-years is a more appropriate figure — and greatly reduces the “cost” per job. The RNC’s number is not entirely out of whole cloth, but we agree with Zandi that it’s seriously misleading. The RNC earns Three Pinocchios.

            "[Evidences]:At the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more gun control. \"Just think about this -- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns,\" she said. The Iowa debate took place Nov. 14, and the Las Vegas debate happened on Oct. 13. Really? Were 3,000 people were killed by guns in just one month? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign for evidence, they directed us to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2013 -- the most recent CDC tally -- 33,636 people died in gun incidents. If you divide that by 12, it comes out to 2,803 -- or nearly 3,000 people a month. But Clinton was talking about 2015, not 2013. More recent data doesn’t seem to exist. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said the CDC is the best source on this topic. A CDC spokesman told us that 2014 data will come out in December. The only alternative we could find is the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit organization that keeps a running tally of gun deaths by combing through police blotters and news media, among other sources, daily. The Gun Violence Archive’s numbers aren’t comprehensive, though. In 2014, the group counted 12,500 gun deaths in 2014 and 11,500 so far in 2015 -- both less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. This is largely because the count doesn't include suicides, whichmake up more than half of all gun deaths. The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, said Mark Bryant, the archive's executive director. He said that their total number of gun deaths could triple when that data is added in. So Clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas. Still, we wanted to know if it was possible Clinton’s claim is accurate for this year, so we ran her number by some experts. \"My call is that Clinton’s claim is not necessarily proven, but it is well in the range of possibility,\" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor who studies violent crime at the University of Central Florida. In fact, the total for 2015 might be higher than 2013, as gun suicides are up, said Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun violence at the University of California Davis. Homicides are up, too, which would contribute to a higher number of gun deaths this year, Corzine noted. One final note on Clinton’s phrasing: Some could interpret her description of gun deaths -- \"killed by guns\" -- as violence inflicted upon one person by another. However, more than 60 percent of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, according to the CDC. Our ruling Clinton said, \"Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.\" We found a few problems with her statement. First, we don’t actually know how many people have died in the last month. Clinton’s statement is based on 2013 data from the CDC, which tallied nearly 3,000 gun deaths per month that year. There’s not more recent data available. Experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than 2013, so Clinton’s claim is probably not too far off. But we can’t know for sure. Also, it’s likely that at roughly half of these deaths are due to suicide. It could be even higher. Clinton’s phrasing obscures that point. Clinton used very specific language even though she’s actually extrapolating from old data. Overall, we rate her claim Half True.

            "claim [Claim]: Actor Leonardo DiCaprio donated $10 million to the International Visegrad Fund to aide Ukraine following Russia's invasion of the country in February 2022.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In March 2022, a rumor started circulating online that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had donated $10 million to Ukraine after the country was invaded by Russia. While this claim was repeated ad nauseam across social media, there’s little evidence to suggest that it’s true. In an article that has since been deleted, the Daily Mail reported: Hollywood megastar Leonardo DiCaprio has donated $10million (£7.6million) to a fund for Ukraine, where his grandmother was born in 1915. The actor was reportedly very close with his grandmother – Helene Indenbirken – and would take her to premiers of many of his films. DiCaprio would call her ‘Oma’. The donation from the 47-year-old was announced by the International Visegrad Fund, according to Polish News. For starters, neither Leonardo DiCaprio nor the International Visegrad Fund (IVF) have made any announcements about this alleged donation. We searched the social media profiles and websites for both the actor and the IVF, an international donor organization that finances grants and scholarships to encourage the “advancement of innovative ideas in Central and Eastern Europe,” and found no mention of this alleged donation. Furthermore, this rumor can’t be traced back to a reputable news source. While most articles about this alleged donation quoted a report from a website called “Polish News,” that March 7 article is not the primary source for this rumor. The earliest iteration of this claim that we could find was published on guyanasouthamerica.gy on March 5, 2022. That article cited anonymous “sources” inside Ukraine: Sources inside Ukraine today, 5th of May, 2022, disclosed that Hollywood superstar, famed for his role in the hit movie “Titanic,” Leonardo DiCaprio, has transferred ten million US dollars to the Ukrainian government as the war rages on between Russia and Ukraine. Presumably, the huge donation is meant to support the war efforts as well as humanitarian efforts within the country. This original report states that DiCaprio donated money directly to the Ukrainian government. This simply doesn’t seem feasible, especially without any statements from the Ukrainian government. (We checked. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has not mentioned any multi-million dollar donations from DiCaprio.) The claim that this money was donated to the International Visegrad Fund appears to come from people making big assumptions based on little information. On March 6, a day after the anonymously sourced guyanasouthamerica.gy article was published, the Twitter account Visegrad 24 picked up on the story and published the following tweet. (Visegrad 24 previously shared a false rumor that Pornhub was blocking Russian users from accessing its site). This tweet does not claim that DiCaprio donated money to the International Visegrad Fund. Rather, it says that the money was “donated to Ukraine.” It seems likely that people saw this tweet, connected Visegrad 24 to the International Visegrad Fund, and assumed that this is where DiCaprio’s alleged donation went. A spokesperson for the International Visegrad Fund told us that they were unaware of any such donation from DiCaprio: “We are not aware, neither do we have any information about Leonardo DiCaprio donating USD 10 million/£7.6 million to Ukraine. International Visegrad Fund has not announced this information.” While DiCaprio did not donate $10 million to this fund, the spokesperson did say that prime ministers from V4 countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) agreed on a “support package of 1 million euros to help Ukraine via the International Visegrad Fund.” The spokesperson said: I can, however, inform you that the V4 Prime Ministers met in London on 8 March 2022 where they agreed on a support package of 1 million euros to help Ukraine via the International Visegrad Fund. An extraordinary call for applications will be shortly available to NGOs, organisations, and municipalities from the V4 countries and Ukraine with a focus on improving the situation of refugees from Ukraine. While the rumors that DiCaprio donated $10 million to the Ukraine military or the International Visegrad Fund are untrue, the actor really has made a few private donations of unknown amounts to various humanitarian organizations working in Ukraine. People Magazine reported: Previous reports claiming the actor had donated $10 million for Ukrainian military use and that DiCaprio has family ties to Ukraine are not true. “Leo had privately made several donations to humanitarian groups — CARE, IRC, UNHCR and Save the Children. All directed at Ukraine,” a source close to the Don’t Look Up actor tells PEOPLE. “He had been watching things unfold and wanted to support Ukraine the best he could. He will continue to support the humanitarian groups on the ground which are helping the people of Ukraine.” Sources: Dickler, Jessica. “Here’s a List of the Top-Rated Charities to Help the Ukraine Relief Effort.” CNBC, 9 Mar. 2022, https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/heres-a-list-of-top-rated-charities-to-help-the-ukraine-relief-effort.html.

            "[Evidences]:By their very nature, State of the Nation addresses are tricky to fact-check. They are written by committees, the product of many hands and input from many government departments and agencies. The facts and figures that make the final cut are carefully selected and often stripped of nuance and context to present the most positive picture possible.This was President Jacob Zuma’s sixth State of the Nation address and the last of his current term. You can read his full speech here.Being an election year, Zuma’s speech borrowed heavily from the African National Congress manifesto and reflected on the ANC’s claimed achievements over the past five years and twenty years. Viewed in isolation, many of the numbers he presented stand up. But they often lack context. We have endeavoured, as best we can, to evaluate Zuma’s claims within a broader context.This is a look at some of the key claims that were made.Claim “We have created 3.7 million work opportunities over the past five years.” Verdict unprovenClaim “The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61 percent in 2009 to 78 percent last year and the bachelor passes improve each year.” Verdict misleadingClaim “The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300 thousand to more than 700 thousand between 2003 and 2011.” Verdict correctClaim “Student enrolments at universities increased by 12% while further Education and Training college enrolments have increased by 90%.” Verdict correctClaim “When 95% of households have access to water, the 5% who still need to be provided for, feel they cannot wait a moment longer. Success is also the breeding ground of rising expectations.” Verdict unprovenClaim “Parliament is finalising amendments to the law to give effect to this very positive development, which will cut to under 300 days, the time it takes to start a mine, from application to final approvals.” Verdict correctClaim \"The tourism industry has grown dramatically. In 1993, South Africa received a mere 3 million foreign visitors. By 2012, the figure had grown to 13 million visitors.\" Verdict exaggeratedClaim “The overall crime rate has decreased by 21 percent since 2002…” Verdict misleadingClaim \"On average, the economy has grown at 3,2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “Jobs are now being created again.There are now 15 million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650 thousand jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.” Verdict misleadingClaim “Mother to child transmission of HIV has declined sharply.\" Verdict correctClaim \"[W]e have doubled the number of people who are receiving anti-retroviral treatment, from one million to 2.4 million people in 2013.” Verdict misleadingClaim “More than 20 million South Africans have taken the HIV test since the launch of the campaign in 2011 which indicates confidence in the health system.” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “In housing, about 3 million housing units and more than 855 thousand serviced sites were delivered since 1994.” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “Nearly 500 informal settlements have been replaced with quality housing and basic services over the past five years.” Verdict unprovenClaim “Since 1994, nearly 5,000 farms, comprising 4.2 million hectares, have been transferred to black people, benefiting over 200,000 families.” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “Nearly 80,000 land claims, totalling 3.4 million hectares, have been settled and 1.8 million people have benefited.” Verdict mostly-correctThe 2012/13 annual report of the Department of Public Works states that 3,054,027 “work opportunities” were created between April 2009 and March 2013. Zuma’s claim can only be properly assessed when the figures for 2013/14 are released later this year.It is important to note that a “work opportunity” is not a permanent job. South Africa’s department of public works defines a work opportunity as “paid work created for an individual” as part of South Africa’s expanded public works programme. Many “work opportunities” last only a few months. For instance , a “work opportunity” lasts an average of four months in the “infrastructure sector” and six months in the “environment and culture” sector. Ideally, these opportunities are meant to equip people with skills that can help them seek formal employment.It should be noted that even if 3.7-million “work opportunities” were created it does not mean that 3.7-million people gained work. If someone is hired for one project and then moves on to another and another, each period of employment is counted as a single “work opportunity”.In 2009 the matric pass rate was 60.6%. It increased to 78.2% in 2013 However, South Africa’s high dropout rate means that many young people will never get the chance to write their matric examinations, let alone pass them.When the matric class of 2013 started grade two in 2003 there were 1,111,858 students. But by the time they came to sit for their final exams their numbers had fallen to 562,112. (Read our report on why the matric pass rate is not a reliable benchmark of education quality With regard to the second part of Zuma’s claim, bachelor passes have not improved consistently each year since 2009. According to the education department, the number of bachelor passes increased from 109,697 in 2009 to 126,371 in 2010. But in 2011 the number of bachelor passes dipped to 120,767, before increasing to 136,047 in 2012 and 171,755 in 2013 In 2003 there were 315,387 students enrolled in Grade R, according to the basic education department. By 2011, enrolment had increased to 734,654. In 2013 , it had increased to 779,370. These figures include both public and independent schools.Zuma did not give dates for the increases but his claim appears to be supported by the Department of Higher Education and Training’s 2012/13 annual report. It states that student enrolment at universities increased by 12% from 837,779 in 2009 to 938,201 in 2012/13.However, demand for university education far outweighs the number of places available. In 2013, the University of the Witwatersrand received over 35,000 applications for approximately 5,500 first year placesFurther Education and Training College enrolments increased from 345,566 in 2010 to 657,690 in 2012/13.An odd statement. Without “access to water” people die. It follows that all South Africans therefore have some or other “access to water”, be it piped, bottled, from water tankers, rain water tanks, streams or dams.What exactly Zuma means by the phrase is unclear, as is the source of the claim. We examined a number of similar claims in a report published last year . South Africa’s water and environmental affairs minister, Edna Molewa, has previously claimed that 94.7% of South Africans have access to “clean and safe drinking water”. Her spokesman, Mava Scott, claimed last year that 96.4% of all households had access to “piped water”.The 2011 national census put the figure of households with “access to piped water” at 91.2%. The most recent general household survey , published last year by Statistics South Africa, states that 90.8% of households had “access to piped water” in 2012. The figures differ from province to province. In the Eastern Cape, for instance, only 79% of households were found to have access to piped water.When we spoke to him last year, Scott explained that “[w]hen we talk about piped water, we are normally referring to infrastructure and people have access to water coming out of that infrastructure” . As recent violent water protests in South Africa’s North West province have shown, having a tap in your yard, home or street, doesn’t mean you have water or that the water is “clean and safe”.Nationally there has been growing dissatisfaction over the quality of water. According to the general household survey , in 2012, “60,1% of households rated the quality of water-related services they received as ‘good’”.“Satisfaction has, however, been eroding steadily since 2005 when 76,4% of users rated the services as good. Residents of Free State, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape have consistently been least satisfied with the quality of water. In 2012, 15,1% of households in Free State felt that their water smelled bad compared to 11,7% of Mpumalanga households and only 2,4% of Gauteng households. Free State households were most likely to feel that their water was unsafe to drink (15,1%), not clear (16,5%) and not tasting well (15,2%).”Zuma’s suggestion that recent violent service delivery protests can be attributed to the “rising expectations” of the “5% who still need to be provided for”, has been characterised as “spin-doctoring” by a number of political commentators and opposition parties. We have been unable to find any reliable research that supports his contention.A typed copy of Zuma’s speech that was circulated by Zuma’s office quotes him referring to “under 300 days” as the time it will take to start a mine. But, while delivering his speech in parliament, Zuma referred to “under 30 days” . (Watch from 2:22:00) Zuma appears to have misread the speech. His spokesman, Mac Maharaj, told Africa Check the correct figure is 300 days. Statistics South Africa indicates slightly more than 3-million foreign travellers came to South Africa in 1993. In earlier presentations , President Zuma has referred to a figure of 3,4-million foreign visitors for that year.The latest tourism report from StatsSA confirms that during 2012 “about 13,8 million foreigners arrived in South Africa”. Not all of these, however, are considered tourists.StatsSA states 94,7% of foreign arrivals in 2012 were “visitors” of which 29,7% were “same day visitors” and 70,3% – or 9,2-million people – were overnight visitors or “tourists”. The balance were classed as business travellers, students and workers.StatsSA defines “tourist” as an overnight visitor, and tourism as “the activities of persons travelling to, and staying in places outside their usual environment, for not more than one consecutive year, for leisure, business and other purposes.”SADC countries are the single biggest source of foreign visitors to South Africa, accounting for more than 70% of all tourists. This figure/proportion is consistent with previous decades – the 1996 White Paper on Tourism indicates 73% of all international arrivals in 1995 were from African countries.Aurelia Segatti, a researcher at the African Centre for Migration & Society explains that, as most SADC nationals, and citizens of many other countries, may enter the country for up to 90 days on a tourist visa, a “tourist” stamp does not necessarily give us an indication of individual motives for entering South Africa – and that many of these reasons may fall outside the sightseeing and curio-buying associated with “tourism”.Segatti says that, although it is not possible to do a qualitative breakdown of exactly how many foreign visitors come to South Africa for exactly which reasons, many are involved in trade, “coming to Johannesburg and shopping in malls, and getting goods back to [their] place of origin”. Many of these traders travel with their relatives. There are people who also come to visit friends and family in South Africa. Some travel for medical reasons in order to seek private healthcare or to access public healthcare facilities. People also “visit” South Africa in an attempt to illegally enter the South African labour market.The decrease in the overall crime rate claimed by Zuma refers only to the period 2002/2003 to 2011/2012. It excludes the most recent 2012/2013 crime statistics which have shown worrying increases in a number of categories of serious and violent crime.On the face of it, Zuma’s claim appears to be supported by a 2012 fact sheet prepared by South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies which stated that “[s]ince the 2002/03 financial year, when total crime levels peaked in South Africa, the overall crime rate has decreased by 21%”.But the fact-sheet also pointedly cautioned that overall crime rates do not give us useful information in terms of increases or decreases in specific crime categories, with respect to regional crime rate changes, or the reasons for the change in crime rates.Without this context, the victory-against-crime claim recycled in the president’s State of the Nation address becomes almost meaningless.Zuma’s claim deliberately selects 2002 – a period when “total crime levels peaked in South Africa” – as its benchmark. While overall crime rates may have decreased by 21% between 2002 and 2012, the ISS noted that “overall levels of crime [for 2011/2012] are actually quite compar[a]ble with the levels recorded in 1994/1995”.The decline in crime has also not been uninterrupted. According to the ISS, a “3% increase in total crime levels was recorded in the two-year period between 2007/08 and 2009/10”, which was followed by marginal decreases in the subsequent two years.Gareth Newham, head of the Institute’s governance, crime and justice division says that crime levels have seen an overall increase in the last two years, driven by increases in property crime and, more recently, serious violent crimes.In Newham’s view, Zuma’s annual address should have focused on “what has happened in the last year, not distracting us by discussing the last ten years.“In the last year all forms of serious and violent crimes – including murder, attempted murder, house robbery, street robbery – all of these have increased. Murder is of particular concern, because the [murder rate] had been coming down – and this is the first time murder has increased in seven years.”According to the World Bank “GDP growth in South Africa has averaged 3.2% a year since 1995 ”. This is confirmed by Africa’s Check’s own calculations based on real GDP tables.While Zuma’s numbers were correct, the context was noticeably lacking.Economic growth – evaluated in terms of real GDP – has slowed in recent years. In 2012, South Africa’s GDP growth fell to 2.5%. The World Bank estimated GDP growth at just 1.9% for 2013, the lowest since the 2009 recession. It is expected to increase to a projected 2.7% for 2014.Rian le Roux, chief economist at Old Mutual, says that since 1994 the economy has seen “periods of bad growth and times when the economy did quite well”, the latter boosted by global commercial booms, and local infrastructure and credit booms. “The question is what is the growthat the moment and that’s probably less than 3%.”This figure, le Roux says, means there will be insufficient growth to address the backlog of unemployment or drive the creation of new jobs, and means that even where jobs are created they may not be sustainable.This view is supported by a recent statement from the International Monetary Fund , which praises South Africa’s strong macroeconomic policies but points out that the country’s economic performance has been slower and lower than other emerging markets – and that the current growth rate “creates jobs, but not enough for the growing labor [sic] force and those currently without work”.Le Roux says that to “overcome the backlog of 20 years of isolation we need to have fast economic growth”.“There are 500,000 new matriculants who can’t find jobs. The youth subsidy will not make much of a dent. We have got to raise the growth rate and increase the labour absorption capacity of the private sector.”Addressing issues like low business confidence and problematic labour relations will, le Roux says, create more favourable business conditions and “make people want to invest in South Africa.”According to latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey published by StatsSA, 15,177,000 people were employed in the last quarter of 2013 and 653,000 jobs were created in the last year.What Zuma failed to acknowledge is that the unemployment rate in South Africa is higher today than it was before the recession.Prior to the recession South Africa’s unemployment rate was 21.9%. According to StatsSA, 4,830,000 South Africans are classified as unemployed , resulting in an unemployment rate of 24.1%. But StatsSA uses a very narrow definition of “unemployment” which refers only people who are unemployed but actively seeking work.An “expanded rate” of unemployment - which includes people who do not have a job and are available to work but have not taken active steps to look for work - suggests that unemployment levels were as high as 34% in the fourth quarter of last year A recent study published by the World Health Organisation showed that mother-to-child transmission of HIV in South Africa dropped from 8,5% in 2008 to 3,5% in 2010 and 2,7% in 2011.This could be read to mean that during 2013 the number of people on anti-retroviral treatment doubled from 1-million to 2.4-million. That is not the case.StatsSA estimated that there were 1,058,399 adults and 105,123 children receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2010. Using data from the Department of Health, the 2012/13 District Health Barometer , estimated that 2,161,170 adults were on anti-retroviral treatment by the end of 2012/13.But, as the Barometer pointed out, the number of adults on anti-retroviral treatment could be overestimated if patients are not excluded from counts when, for example, they die or fail to adhere to the programme.Other concerns about the counts have also been raised .The fact that people are receiving anti-retroviral treatment does not mean they are currently taking it or will continue to take it. It's also not clear how tests are counted. Are people who get tested multiple times counted once per test or only once? We have asked the department for clarity and will update the report if they respond.In response to some of the criticisms, South Africa’s health minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, has argued that South Africa’s increasing life expectancy suggests that people are adhering to their treatment.South Africa’s HIV counselling and testing campaign was launched in April 2010, not 2011. According the country’s health department, the available data suggests that 9.7-million people had been tested by the end of 2010/11 In 2011/2012 the department claims that 8.7-million people were tested. In 2012/13 , it says close to 9-million people were tested for HIV.The department’s 2013/14 annual report will only be released later this year, but calculations based on figures in previous annual reports indicate that around 27-million people have been tested since the launch of the campaign in 2010, well above Zuma’s claim.But there appear to be serious discrepancies in the department’s figures. The 2012/13 annual report states that 20-million people were tested in 2010/11. However, this is contradicted by the 2010/11 annual report which states that 9.7-million people were tested in that year.It should also be noted that while the programme reported testing almost 9-million people in 2012/13, the department failed to meet its target of 18-million tests.The Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation’s latest development indicators show that about 3.3-million housing units have either been completed or are “in progress”.According to Xolani Xundu, a spokesman in the Department of Human Settlements, 2,799,702 “houses and units” were delivered from 1994 to December 2013. He says the number of “serviced sites” delivered over that period came to 876,774. 2013 report by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) pointed out that housing figures from different government sources are often contradictory.According to the Department of Human Settlements the figure is correct, but the data does not exist in a single collated form, and should refer only to basic services as it does not necessarily include housing.The department’s Victor Rajkumar told Africa Check there were “myriad source documents” from which the department gathered its information. While no “list” exists showing that 500 informal settlements have been upgraded, Rajkumar says data from various sources indicates “at least 500 interventions or upgrading interventions” in informal settlements.Defining the extent and status of informal settlements in South Africa remains a contentious issue.The current baseline used to measure the number of informal settlements in South Africa comes from 2009. It states that there are approximately 2,700 informal settlements across the country, and that households in these settlements continue to grow at around 3% per annum. (According to the human settlements department, this figure will be updated during the course of 2014)A recent report from the Housing Development Agency suggests that the number of households living in informal settlements has stabilised since 2001. In 2011 there were approximately 1,66-million households in informal residential areas or shacks not in a backyard.Kate Tissington from the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) told Africa Check that while government “likes to talk about upgrading settlements”, the reality is that very little has been done. According to Tissington, “delivery figures around informal settlement upgrading are often very ambiguous, sometimes referring to formal housing projects and often hiding the removal of people from settlements and the growth of households living in backyard shacks”.Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti told Parliament last year that 4,813 farms had been transferred to black people and communities between 1994 and 2013, benefiting 230,886 people.In 2012, a survey by the South African Institute of Race Relations found that 2,864 farms had been redistributed by August 2009. Between 2009 and 2012, 848 farms were acquired, giving a total of 3,712 farms by 2012. The survey found there were over 220,000 beneficiaries by March 2012.The accuracy of the official government figures have however been questioned.Dr Peter Jacobs, a research specialist in economic performance and development at the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), told Africa Check discrepancies exist between figures compiled by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, the National Treasury and “various researchers”.South Africa’s land reform programme has been dogged by controversy amid reports of farms failing and projects collapsing.A survey of land reform and restitution projects presented at a 2013 conference on agrarian reform organised by the HSRC, indicated that one third of 301 households surveyed were not actively using the land they had received.“Within that third there are some [people] that have taken big loans, they are failing to pay back and in those cases the land has been taken back by the banks,” said Dr Jacobs.In recent years senior government officials, including Nkwinti, have repeatedly stated that over 90 per cent of the land transferred through the land reform programme is not productive Professor Ben Cousins, the founder of the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (Plaas) has argued that “the actual failure rate is more like 50%, and a further 30% are struggling”.To address the challenge, government embarked on a recapitalisation and development programme . By March 2013, 1,351 farms were reported to have been recapitalised , at a cost of R2.14-billion.Jacobs believes that land reform and redistribution projects have thus far failed to bring about transformation and have created a rural elite that benefits more than the poor.According to Cousins “there are some success stories, but a great many failures too” for “beneficiaries who have been told (or chosen) to enter into strategic partnerships with businesses”.Zuma’s speech also made no mention of the fact that far less than 10% of the land earmarked for redistribution has been transferred. The initial target, set in 2009, was that 30% of the land that was historically in the hands of “white commercial farmers” would be redistributed by 2014.“Government is not likely to transfer the remaining 20% of land within the next 20 to 30 years,” Jacobs believes.A total of 67,531 land claims had been submitted by 1999. A backlog in processing saw this number grow to a total of 79,696 claims. By the end of 2012 nearly 96% of these claims had reportedly been settled.The 2012/2013 annual report of the Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights states: “A total of 77,334 claims have been settled to date. Of these, 71,292 claims were settled by payment of financial compensation of R6,561,021,691 to claimants.”The annual report also indicates that a “total of 111,278 people benefitted from the restitution programme in the 2012/13 financial year”.An earlier Progress Report on Land Restitution Claims delivered to the Portfolio Committee On Rural Development and Land Reform in February 2012 indicated that, between 1995 and January 2012, a total of 76,506claims had been settled which impacted on 1,662,099beneficiaries.When the 2012/13 figure of 111,278 is added to this, it results in a total of 1,773,377 individuals.\n",

            "[Evidences]:On April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn’t very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet. An article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: “Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach – Could end civilisation if it hits.” The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter: While these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn’t the case. While Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet. NASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website. Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn’t making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth. While an asteroid of this sizewouldcause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there’s practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won’t come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon. Asteroid Watch, the official Twitter account of the CNEOS, attempted to quell fears about this asteroid, writing that it will “safely pass” Earth and that NASA did not issue a “warning” about a possible catastrophic collision. Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) is not currently listed on NASA’s list ofpotential future Earth impact events. CNEOS writes (emphasis ours): On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth’s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth’s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth’s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth’s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth’s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth’s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories. […] No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet.The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them. NASA is currently tracking about 20,000 NEOs. While these objects routinely pass by Earth without incident, every now and again a media outlet will write an outlandish story about how one of these objects is posed to wipe out life on earth. While we’ve seen several of these fear-mongering rumors over the years, these “doomsday” asteroids never seem to arrive.\n",

Rhea Chakraborty got bail on Wednesday after spending almost a month in jail in the Bollywood drug racket probe, initiated post Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Soon after, a tweet, purportedly made by her, started doing the rounds on social media in which she asked what her crime was. “Got bail after being in jail for 28 days, after all what was the crime.?” reads the tweet made from the handle “@tweet2_rhea”. Some verified Twitter handles also retweeted it, believing it was posted by Rhea herself. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the Twitter handle “@tweet2_rhea” does not belong to Rhea Chakraborty. It is a fake account impersonating her original Twitter handle, which is “@Tweet2Rhea”. Similarities and differences Comparing the fake and original Twitter accounts, we found there are enough similarities between the two which could easily mislead a user. The fake handle, “@tweet2_rhea” is almost the same as the original “@Tweet2Rhea”. The screenshots of their Twitter bios also look similar with the same photos and description saying, “smile a lot, because one day your teeth will fall off..: D”. In the fake account, “#justiceforssr #justiceforrhea CT-15” is added to the bio. But the biggest difference is that Rhea has a verified Twitter handle with a blue tick. Rhea’s Twitter account Fake handle Deciphering the fake account As per data given by “TweetBeaver”, this fake account was created on July 8, 2020. This account is now being followed by over 1,100 people, including some verified users. We found that Rhea has not tweeted anything from her handle “@Tweet2Rhea” after July 16. On that day, she had appealed to the Home Minister for a CBI inquiry into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. After that, the account remained silent for weeks. The fake handle, on the other hand, kept on tweeting about various issues ranging from politics to Hathras while Rhea was in jail for 28 days. Simultaneously, it kept appealing for Rhea’s bail. Using “foller.me”, we found the range of subjects upon which this Twitter account reacted. In the last three months, it posted 3,335 tweets. Hence, it can be concluded that the viral tweet was not made by Rhea. She did not speak on her bail till the filing of this article. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim On October 7, Rhea tweeted that she got bail after spending 28 days in jail. She asked what her crime is.

            "[Evidences]:Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The sanctions relief requires the Russian billionaire, who has ties to President Vladimir Putin, to divest himself of large corporate ownership stakes, including a controlling interest in the world’s second largest aluminium production company, Rusal. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, expressed skepticism about the administration's proposal during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to force a vote against the sanctions relief shortly. Warner said the Treasury Department has \"a scheme to try to take (Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45\" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. But he doubted the arrangement would curb Deripaska’s influence. \"As more and more of this information comes out about ties between Trump and Trump officials and the Russians,\" Warner said, \"it is the worst time to signal that we're going to take the pressure off of oligarchs like Deripaska.\" Warner’s partial description of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska is right, but it leaves out important details. Furthermore, several experts we spoke to had a different read of the Trump’s administration’s reasons for wanting the sanctions lifted. We asked Warner's office for comment, but didn't hear back. Warner was right about some of the mechanics of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska. Here’s the quick backstory on the sanctions. Last April, the Treasury Department placed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, as well as a dozen companies the oligarchs either owned or controlled. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC — the Treasury Department’s sanctions arm — said in a report that \"the action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites that further the Kremlin's global malign activities.\" The misbehavior included \"attempts to subvert Western democracy, support for the (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad regime, malicious cyber activities, occupation of Crimea, and instigation of violence in Ukraine.\" Among the dozen sanctioned companies were three that were connected to Deripaska, who the Treasury Department referred to as \"a Kremlin insider.\" Deripaska held a 70 percent ownership stake in EN+, the holding company for the aluminum powerhouse Rusal, and energy company ESE. The department agreed to lift sanctions on the three companies in exchange for Deripaska’s ownership stake in EN+ dropping from 70 to 44.95 percent. Doing so clears a key threshold. With Deripaska no longer the majority owner, the company becomes eligible to have sanctions lifted under the Treasury Department’s \"50-percent rule,\" a process known as delisting. But the deal tacks on additional conditions that Warner didn’t mention. It includes a corporate restructuring, designed to limit Deripaska’s (and Kremlin) influence over the companies, plus additional reporting and transparency requirements. Unless lawmakers block it, the sanctions are due to be lifted very soon, by Jan. 18. While this would relieve some of the economic pain inflicted on Deripaska’s companies, it’s worth noting that the sanctions on Deripaska personally would remain in effect. \"Deripaska won't see a penny of the income from the shares until he himself is delisted — and that is not in the cards with this divestiture deal,\" said Samantha Sultoon, a visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Most of the foreign policy experts we talked to — though not all — shared Warner’s skepticism that the corporate reshuffling plan would keep Deripaska in check. \"Given how business is done by influential, Kremlin-connected oligarchs in Russia, I have no question that if Deripaska wants to be in control, he will be,\" said Joseph DeThomas, a former high-ranking State Department official who teaches international affairs at Penn State University. Warner is among a group of Democrats who have raised questions about the Trump administration’s motives for granting sanctions relief to the Deripaska-linked companies, which they see as helping out a Putin crony. However, most experts we spoke to said this is a case of the Trump administration’s clumsiness, not coziness. Back in April, when the sanctions hit the aluminum giant Rusal, it sent shockwaves through the global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared over the following weeks. Europe, which relies heavily on Russia’s metals market, faced the prospect of plant closures and lost jobs. Even now, the European Union strongly supports the lifting of sanctions. The move also disrupted Rusal’s global supply chain. According to the Treasury Department, Rusal subsidiaries in the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and elsewhere \"faced imminent closure,\" before the Treasury stepped in to mitigate some of the damage. According to experts, the Treasury discovered it had bitten off more than it could chew. \"They were done clumsily,\" Alina Polyakova, of the Brookings Institution, said of the sanctions. \"It seems clear that the administration did not plan for the dramatic effects on aluminum markets and the knock-on effects on European businesses.\" Warner himself acknowledged this aspect, saying, \"I know there's concerns from our European allies about these sanctions.\" That seems to undercut Senate Democrats’ suggestion that sanctions-relief is a sign of undue coziness between team Trump and Russian oligarchs. Still, in the midst of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Moscow, the optics of the sanctions relief plan are not good. \"The Treasury was in a hopeless situation and does not want to state clearly that they made a mistake,\" said Anders Åslund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"Therefore they now look as if they are helping Deripaska.\" Warner said the Trump administration has \"a scheme to try to take (Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45\" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. Warner’s description of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska is partially right, but it leaves out important details. The plan also entails corporate restructuring, plus additional reporting and transparency measures. And the sanctions against Deripaska himself would remain in place. Most experts we spoke to said sanctions relief wasn’t a \"scheme\" so much as it was the Trump administration’s way of ending the disruption it inflicted on the global metals market when it sanctioned Deripaska’s aluminum company Rusal. In other words, it’s more likely a case of clumsiness, rather coziness with Russian oligarchs — as Senate Democrats suggest. We rate this Half True. \n",

            "[Evidences]:Two Facebook (FB) pages uploaded a doctored news report on an intellectually-gifted young boy and created the post as if it were an advertisement for a children’s multivitamin called Bearbites. The original 24 Oras report, aired on June 18, 2019, only highlighted the intelligence of the four-year-old kid named Miguel, who could count in Russian, multiply in Spanish, and sing the alphabet song backward, among other feats. Bearbites, which claims to improve concentration and memory retention, is not on the Food and Drug Administration list of verified food and drug products. Neither is it in the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities database used by doctors for drug information. To add credibility to the fake ad, a male narrator revised and re-voiced the 24 Oras report’s script, originally read by GMA News journalist Saleema Refran. The narrator added clips and lines to endorse Bearbites. One of the bogus lines added was this: “Ayon sa magulang ni Miguel, Bearbites daw ang sikreto sa pagiging matalino, bibo, at madiskarte sa murang edad (According to Miguel’s parent, Bearbites is the secret to being intelligent, alert, and resourceful at an early age).” The child’s parents made no such attribution. To further add authenticity to the post, the 24 Oras logo and crawling text were inserted in portions of the footage promoting the multivitamin. The fake advertisement, posted by FB pages Wisdomable and Bearkids Ph on Oct. 7 and 18, respectively, also carried a link to a website (smartvit.store) that gathered personal information.

            "[Evidences]:In a discussion over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, prior to President Donald Trump’s announcement to repeal it, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said immigration laws should be vigorously enforced. That’s because legal immigration has hit a record high. \"We have record levels of legal immigration… We have over a million people a year, more than at any time in the history of this country,\" Santorum said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 3, 2017. \"We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country.\" Are more immigrants coming into the United States legally than at any other time in history, and are they on track to outnumber previous immigrant populations? The number of annual legal immigrants has been higher in the past. But Santorum has a point that the United States is on pace to surpass general immigration proportions (although it’s not there yet). A total of 1,051,031 persons were granted lawful immigration status in 2015, the latest year recorded by the Homeland Security Department. Over half of those were already living in the United States. That encompasses those who received a green card, were admitted as temporary nonimmigrants, were granted asylum or refugee status, or are naturalized. That is over a million, as Santorum said, but it’s not the highest it’s ever been. There were 1,090,172 legal immigrants granted status in 1989; 1,535,872 in 1990; and 1,826,595 in 1991. Between 2001 and 2014, there were 11 years in which lawful immigrants also surpassed 1 million, eight of which surpassed the 2015 rate. And it’s not a recent phenomenon. Between 1905 and 1914, there were six years in which legal immigration surpassed 1 million. Four of those had higher immigration rates than 2015. And that’s significant because it was a much larger percentage of the population compared to today. Immigration law largely explains the trends above. The lack of numerical restrictions on entry before 1924 (except for Chinese immigrants) meant that nearly every immigrant was legal, making the early numbers more representative than the current ones (as illegal immigration is unaccounted for in the chart). It also meant fewer deportations than today. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalized 2.7 million unauthorized immigrants, reflected in the spike between 1989 and 1991. And more recent spikes are explained by the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, the Real ID Act, and backlog reductions at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. If Santorum had been talking about both illegal and legal immigrants combined, the number of annual immigrants would be slightly higher today, but still not a record. The Census Bureau found that nearly 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants had arrived in the United States in 2014, but 1.66 million arrived in 2000. The total 2015 number isn’t yet available, but it was projected to reach 1.6 million. On the overall number of immigrants, Santorum is correct. The Census Bureau estimates there are 43.3 million foreign-born people in the United States, which beats all previous records. Pew Research Center places that number at 45 million. But the overall population of the United States has more than tripled from 1900 to 2000, which means we should also look at percentages of the population. The immigrant share of the U.S. population was 13.5 percent in 2015. That still doesn’t surpass the record high immigrant shares in 1910, 1890 and 1870, which were 14.7 percent, 14.8 percent and 14.4 percent respectively. Data collection began in 1850. The percentage of the overall population that was foreign born was only a little higher back then (while the absolute number of immigrants was high) because proportionally, more people went back home and immigrants, like citizens, suffered a higher death rate than today. As Santorum said, we are on track to beat the record. The Center for Immigration Studies projects the United States will surpass the 14.8 percent marker in 2023, driven largely by legal immigration. Pew projects the fast-growing immigrant population will push the share of the foreign-born U.S. population to a record of 18 percent in 2065. When asked if recent changes in immigration policy could alter those projections, Center for Immigration Studies director Steven Camarota said they likely wouldn’t, as the immigrant percentage of the population has never grown as exponentially as it has since 1970 (from 4.7 to 13.5 percent). Columbia University immigration historian Mae Ngai said we should be wary of population trend predictions to begin with, as they are based on assumptions that don’t always hold true. Santorum said, \"We have over a million (legal immigrants) a year, more than at any time in the history of this country. We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country.\" While we do have over 1 million annual legal immigrants, it’s been surpassed multiple times in both recent years and at the turn of the twentieth century. We are still a few years away from exceeding the record from last century of the share of immigrant population, and that’s based on projections. We rate this statement Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A video is being shared widely on social media in which BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia can be seen asking people to vote for Congress (‘Hand’ symbol) on the third (date), but later realises his mistake and asks to vote for BJP (‘Lotus’ symbol). It is being claimed that the incident in the video happened recently in the context of the current 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections. The sixth phase of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections will be conducted on 03 March 2022. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Video of BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia mistakenly asking people to vote for Congress in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections (2022). Fact: The video is neither related to the current Assembly Elections (2022) nor Uttar Pradesh. The video shows Jyotiraditya Scindia’s slip of the tongue at a poll rally in Madhya Pradesh (in 2020). Assembly bypolls happened in Madhya Pradesh on 03 November 2020 as Scindia and a few other legislators switched over from Congress to BJP in March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. When the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. ‘Amar Ujala’ had published the same video in November 2020 and wrote – “Jyotiraditya Scindia Tongue Slips Appealed to Vote Congress Instead of BJP MP By Poll Election”. Assembly bypolls took place in Madhya Pradesh on 03 November 2020 as Scindia and a few other legislators switched over from Congress to BJP in March 2020. The video is related to that election in Madhya Pradesh. The rally was streamed live, on 31 October 2020, on Imarti Devi’s Facebook page (the posted clip can be watched at 45:45 in the video). Many news agencies have reported in November 2020 about Jyotiraditya Scindia’s slip of the tongue at a poll rally in Madhya Pradesh. So, the video is neither related to the current Assembly Elections (2022) nor Uttar Pradesh. To sum it up, the posted video of BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia mistakenly asking people to vote for Congress is not related to UP Elections (2022).\n",

The image purportedly compares PM Modi's outfit to a dress available listed as for women on a website with a price tag of $35 (approximately Rs 2,893 in India) and is being peddled with a false claim that Modi wore a woman's dress. BOOM found the comparison image is morphed. The original picture is taken from an e-commerce website, shows a different design and not what is worn by PM Modi. PM Modi, on December 18, inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for various development projects in Meghalaya's Shillong during his visit to north-eastern part of the country. According to news reports, Modi donned a traditional Khasi attire for the occasion to connect with the local tribal sentiments majorly populated by Khasis in Shillong. Trinamool Congress leader and former Indian cricketer Kirti Azad tweeted the viral image with a Hindi caption which translates to, \"He is neither a male nor a female, he is only a priest of fashion.\" (Original Text in Hindi: न नर है न ही है ये नारी, केवल है ये फैशन का पुजारी/) Click here to view the post. Fact Check BOOM found that the picture of a woman's dress with a price tag of present $35 is photoshopped and is not same when compared to PM Modi's traditional Khasi outfit. A keyword search for \"multi floral embroidered dress $35\" led us to the e-commerce clothing website Shoreline Wear where the original clothing can be seen listed with a $35 price tag. We then compared it with the PM Modi's outfit and found the dress looks different to the tribal attire. The comparison can be seen below. As per the details available on the website, Shoreline Wear is a New York-based company and supplies their products to the North-South America, Caribbean Islands and Mexico. On the other hand, PM Modi's address in Meghalaya wearing Khasi outfit can be seen on Narendra Modi's official YouTube channel. \n",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked through The Art of the Deal. Those words never appear. The word \"believe\" occurs 38 times. But the part about lying isn’t there. On the other hand, when it comes to promotion, Trump did write in the book that he plays to people’s fantasies. \"People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do,\" he wrote. \"That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.\" Three decades before he became president, Trump also described how he played the press. The media, he said, is always hungry for a story, and \"the more sensational, the better.\" \"If you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you,\" Trump said. So the book is still relevant today, but not in the way the meme says. The meme comes from New Century Times, a left-leaning news aggregation site that we’ve rated False before.

            "[Evidences]:Posts on social media claim that \"for every £1 energy companies invest in green energy they receive 91p back from the tax payer\". The posts do not make it clear what exact policy they refer to. There is no government scheme matching these claims with regards to clean energy. It appears the post misunderstands a recent change to government policy which means energy companies can now get a 91p tax saving on every £1 they invest in oil and gas extraction in the UK. This was announced in May, as part of the government's Energy Profits Levy Bill, which was passed in July . The Bill also raised the headline tax rate on oil and gas company profits from 40% to 60%. During the debate on the Bill Simon Clarke, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"We expect that the energy profits levy, with its investment allowance, will lead to an overall increase in investment. Indeed, one oil and gas company has already said that the immediate investment allowance should spark further investment in the North Sea.\" As the Bill was debated it faced criticism from some groups for focusing tax relief on oil and gas investments, rather than renewable sources of energy. There are a number of schemes to encourage businesses to operate in environmentally friendly ways, for example enhanced capital allowances for buying items such as electric cars. However, there is no government scheme matching the green energy claims made in the post. Image courtesy of Ben Wicks\n",

            "[Evidences]:A photograph supposedly showing a pagoda floweris frequently shared on social media along with the claim that it only blooms once every 400 years in the Himalayas: It’s not a cabbage ? but Tibet’s unique “Pagoda Flower”. I was sent this by a dear friend. It is the auspicious Mahameru flower that blooms once every 400 years in the Himalayas. Apparently lucky to see it and will give you a lifetime of good luck – now thats worth sharing! Have a wonderful evening all. Lots love cxxx ??? . #mahameruflower #goodluck #auspicious #beautyinbloom ✨??? A post shared by Ching He Huang (@chinghehuang) on Oct 30, 2019 at 11:30am PDT This picture does not show such a flower (nor the “auspicious Mahameru flower”) but rather a plant called the Rheum nobile. While this large plant is native to the Himalayas, it does not bloom once every 400 years. The above-displayed photograph was taken by Martin Walsh near Daxue Mountain in Yunnan, China. We’re not exactly sure when it was taken, but it was the featured picture for a 2011 newsletter from the Alpine Garden Society. The plant in the foreground is a Rheum nobile, which can grow to more than 1 meter tall, sitting next to its “cousin” plant, the Rhus delavayi: The scenically stunning Da Xue Shan (Big Snow Mountain) proved to be an absolute treasure house of gorgeous plants including meconopsis, lilies, fritillaries, incarvilleas, pedicularis, primulas, corydalis and others. The most imposing was the amazing rhubarb, Rheum nobile (see front cover) dwarfing its cousin, R. delavayi, which stands at a mere 15cm. Among the corydalis, C. benecinta was outstanding and Martin‟s lovely photo of Primula dryadifolia (see p.5) makes us wish we could grow it. The Alpine Garden Society’s Instagram page contains a few additional pictures of the Rheum nobile: Quite a few of you were fascinated by the recent photo of Rheum nobile shared from our China tour. Here’s a closer look at the plant – demonstrating how the flowers are covered by the white bracts. This keeps the flowers 4-6°C warmer in the alpine climate and helps ripen the seed. The plant dies after flowering. . . . . . #rheumnobile #rheum #chinaflowers #chineseflora #wildflowers #alpineflowers #alpineplant #alpinelandscape #mountainflowers #plants #plantlove #plantgeek #travel #china #planthunting #horticulture #botanicaltour A post shared by Alpine Garden Society (@alpinegardensociety) on Jul 9, 2019 at 2:30am PDT An incredible find on our China tour! _______ #Repost @mark.hortic • • • • • • Standing well over a metre tall, the Rheum nobile we saw today on the @alpinegardensociety tour were spectacular.

The flower (Clerodendrum paniculatum) is native to southeast China and produces huge spikes of coral-pink to reddish-orange, butterfly-shaped flowers that bloom from mid-summer well into fall, not every 400 years: This is hardly the first time a rumor about a flower that only blooms once every 400 years in the Himalayas has circulated on social media. In 2018, a nearly verbatim copy of this text was attached to a different picture of a flower. That rumor claimed it was the “ahameru Pushpam,” or arya pu, not the pagoda flower: This is the flower which is known as “Mahameru Pushpam” or Arya Pu. It’s seen in Himalaya. It flowers once in 400 years. If we wanted to see it again need to wait for another 400 years. So our generation is lucky. So please share maximum. Let others to see it. Again, this photograph was mislabeled. It actually showed a Protea cynaroides, or the king protea, which grows in South Africa. In September 2019, a nearly identical rumor was circulated about a “mahameru flower”: And once again, the picture was mislabeled. This photograph actually showed a species of cactus called Carnegiea gigantea. We also investigated a similar rumor back in 2016. That one focused on a flower supposedly called the “nagapushpa flower” and claimed that it bloomed once every 36 years. However, that rumor used a photograph of a marine invertebrate known as a sea pen.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Fake News: Nancy Pelosi Says We Have Been Working On Impeachment For The Past 2 1/2 Years\n",
            "[Evidences]:Did Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi say that she and Democrats had been working on President Trump's impeachment for the past two-and-a-half years? No, that's not true: the claim has been taken out of context from a real quote about other investigations of Trump. The Facebook post and its accompanying meme suggest that Pelosi and Democrats were driving impeachment efforts for 30 months, well before the House embarked on the impeachment process and voted on impeachment on Dec. 13, 2019. Pelosi was actually referring to probes of Trump, specifically the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The real quote, which is altered slightly in the Facebook post, came from Pelosi in an interview with Politico's Anna Palmer in December of 2019. The claim against Pelosi originated from a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook on December 26, 2019. The meme read: Democrats pass articles of impeachment. It will now go to the full House for a vote. Pelosi said, 'We have been working on this for the past 2 1/2 years.' Think about that statement for a moment. The so called 'crime' supposedly took place in June 2019, but Democrats have been working on impeachment for 2 1/2 years. How do you work on something that won't happen for another 30 months? If this isn't an overthrow of an elected president nothing is. The text of the Facebook post surrounding the meme said: THIS MIGHT BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR DEMOCRAT MINDS TO COMPREHEND BUT, I AM OBLIGATED TO TRY ANYWAY. In the interview with Palmer, Pelosi gave the quote in question with regard to criticism of the Democrat's impeachment handling and the Mueller investigation. The claim has been since debunked by others on Twitter, as well as The New York Times and NBC. The claim made its way around the internet, from Trump's original attack of Pelosi on Twitter on Dec. 13, 2019, to articles written on it by The Federalist Papers, MRC TV and Breitbart, among several other sites that still host the misleading claim. But they lack the context in which Pelosi was speaking. Talks of impeachment can be traced back to July of 2017, when two Democratic congressmen - Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas - filed a first article against the president. The 2018 mid-term elections brought impeachment talks into the spotlight, and since then, the Mueller investigation - and the fallout from that probe - only added more intensity to the discussion. But Pelosi has also been historically very vocal in her opposition to impeachment, particularly early on. She said to The Washington Post Magazine on March 11, 2019, that impeachment was not worth it because it would inevitably divide the country even more. It wasn't until September 24, 2019, that she announced the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry after allegations of a quid pro quo with Ukraine surfaced. From there, Pelosi would then announce the next major step in October of 2019 in the process: a House vote on a resolution to officially solidify impeachment proceedings.\n",

            "[Evidences]:An image supposedly showing Kim Kardashian wearing mirrored sunglasses at a poker table is frequently shared on social media along with disparaging comments about the reality star’s perceived intelligence. One common caption, for instance, is, “Whenever you feel like a moron, just remember that Kim Kardashian played poker with mirrored sunglasses.” This is a genuine photograph of the reality television star wearing reflective sunglasses at a poker table. However, this fashion choice isn’t as moronic as the meme would suggest. The photograph was taken in July 2018 at the first annual “If Only” Texas Hold’em charity poker tournament at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif. While we haven’t been able to source this specific photograph, we did find a number of other images showing Kardashian wearing the same glasses at this event. While this image is genuine, it doesn’t document a particularly unusual or “moronic” choice of eye wear. Sunglasses are actually quite common around the poker table. We searched through Getty Images and found photographs of professional poker players such as Phil Laak, Scott Fischman, Iwan Jones, Chip Jett, Chris Moneymaker, and Qui Nguyen wearing similarly reflective eye wear. Here’s an image of World Series of Poker Europe champion Phil Laak wearing reflective glasses at the poker table: Wearing reflective sunglasses during a poker tournament may seem moronic to casual viewers (wouldn’t the other opponents be able to see their cards?), but tournament players rarely hold their cards in a position that would result in their hands’ being displayed on the reflective lenses of their glasses. Most Texas Hold’em players don’t even even lift their cards up off the table, opting instead to just bend up an edge for a sneak peek: The image of Kardashian wearing mirrored sunglasses while playing poker is indeed real. However, it’s not nearly as stupid as presented in this meme.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The claim was published here on the “New Zealand Heritage Union” Facebook page on October 18, 2020. The post features an image of Jacinda Ardern, with text overlay that reads: “FACT”: “JACINDA ARDERN BRIBED NEW ZEALAND MAINSTREAM MEDIA WITH $125 MILLION WORTH OF YOUR MONEY TO WIN HER THE ELECTION. $50 MILLION PRE-ELECTION AND A PROMISED $75 MILLION TO ‘NZ ON AIR’ IF RE-ELECTED.” The post's caption states: “A new report has unveiled the dirty politics behind the Labour Party’s campaign, following alarming information that Kris Faafoi (Labour’s one broadcasting minister) had already been visiting newsrooms across the country months prior to the election - acknowledged by Jacinda Ardern. “With $50 million provided to the media pre-election and $75 promised to ‘NZ on Air’, we implore the electoral commission to inquire as to whether media coverage was entirely unbiased or the electioneering and abuse of power under Labour influenced un-decided voters.” Text on the bottom of the image reads: “AUTHORISED BY THE NEW ZEALAND HERITAGE UNION”. The promoter statement “authorised by” is normally used in advertising by political parties or registered third party promoters. The New Zealand Electoral Commission told AFP in an October 21 email the New Zealand Heritage Union is “not a registered political party or registered third party promoter”. Ardern won a landslide victory in New Zealand's general election on October 17, leveraging success battling Covid-19 into an unprecedented majority she said gave her a mandate for progressive reform, AFP reported here. The image has also been shared hundreds of times alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and on Instagram here. The claim, however, is being shared in a misleading context. By April 2020, the New Zealand media industry was struggling due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. NZME, owner of the NZ Herald and Newstalk ZB, cut 15% of their workforce and Bauer media closed operations in the country, after being forced to halt their printing operations due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I’m fearful that if the financial standing of the owners of Mediaworks and Stuff decline sufficiently they may be minded to follow Bauer and close operations, we must ensure that doesn’t happen,” - Academic and former editor of the NZ Herald, Gavin Ellis. On April 15 academic and former editor of the New Zealand Herald, Gavin Ellis, told the New Zealand Epidemic Response Committee that advertising revenues were in “freefall” and estimated media organisations lost between 50 and 75 percent of their ad revenue since the beginning of the pandemic. “I’m fearful that if the financial standing of the owners of Mediaworks and Stuff decline sufficiently they may be minded to follow Bauer and close operations, we must ensure that doesn’t happen,” he told the committee. On April 23, 2020, the New Zealand Minister for Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Kris Faafoi announced a NZ$50 million support package aimed at helping the media industry “get through the COVID-19 pandemic”. The government press release issued on April 23, 2020 states: \"Full details of the package are: \"$20.5 million to cut 100% of Kordia TV/FM transmission fees for 6 months \"$600,000 to cut 100% of RNZ AM transmission fees for 6 months$16.5 million to reduce, by 80%, media organisations’ NZ On Air content contribution fees for the 2020/21 financial year. \"$1.3 million to purchase central government news media subscriptions in advance for the 2020/21 financial year and encouraging Crown entities to increase their uptake of news media subscriptions. \"$11.1 million for specific targeted assistance to companies as and when needed. \"Commitment to build on the Local Democracy Reporting pilot as part of longer term support.\" The aid for media organisations came a month after the New Zealand Government announced an over $NZ12 billion support package for other industries, businesses and individuals also financially affected by Covid-19. A spokesperson for Minister Faafoi told AFP in an October 23 email a proposed second NZ$75 million (US$49.83 million) tranche of funding still requires “Cabinet approval, with detail on what would be funded and how still to be decided”. According to this TVNZ report, Minister Faafoi reportedly told representatives from the main news media union, E tū, that Labour would commit NZ$75 million to the initiative in three annual blocks of NZ$25 million (US$16.6 million). NZ On Air, the agency responsible for allocating government funding for eligible screen productions, music, community radio stations and news journalism, would be in charge of administering the funding, according to the TVNZ report. New Zealand Labour included the initiative in their election manifesto, describing it as a commitment to “multi-year contestable funding through NZ On Air to fund public interest journalism,” but didn’t provide any other details for the funding. Dr Gavin Ellis told AFP in an October 22 email it was “spurious” to call Covid-19 funding for New Zealand media “bribery”. “To put the funding in perspective: One retail group (The Warehouse) on its own received NZ$67.8 million in wage subsidies during the lockdown,” Dr Ellis added. The TVNZ report also states Minister Faafoi “had visited many newsrooms across the country, and that there was an appetite for financial support to happen as soon as possible, in order to avoid more job losses”. This line was emphasised by the New Zealand Heritage Union, who described it as “alarming information” and implored the New Zealand Electoral Commission to investigate. “Our role does not include regulating the content of campaign advertising, broadcasts or media activity,” - New Zealand Electoral Commission Spokesperson A spokesperson for Minister Faafoi said in an October 23 email “the Minister would have meant that in the broad sense of his interactions with media representatives... such as Sinead Boucher, from stuff.co.nz; Michael Boggs, from NZME; TVNZ, RNZ and Mediaworks representatives; etc”. Minister Faafoi’s parliamentary diaries show video conference meetings with multiple representatives from NZME (NZ Herald and Newstalk ZB), TVNZ, RNZ and Mediaworks. A spokesperson for the New Zealand Electoral Commission told AFP it had no plans to investigate the allegations of bribery made by the New Zealand Heritage Union. “Our role does not include regulating the content of campaign advertising, broadcasts or media activity,” the spokesperson said in an October 23 email.\n",

The article estimates Nigeria’s maternal mortality rate as more than 800 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births.The most recent data was the trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2017 report, Moller said.The report’s estimates are by the WHO, Unicef, the World Bank and other agencies. They put the lifetime risk of maternal death in Nigeria at one in 21, close to the older WHO estimate and the claim in Punch.For a more recent estimate, we checked the 2018 Nigeria demographic and health survey (NDHS). This indicates that one in 34 women in Nigeria is likely to die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.Why is this estimate lower than the WHO’s? A statistician at Nigeria’s data agency told Africa Check the NDHS estimate was based on the seven-year period preceding the survey and included more indicators.The trends report’s estimates, on the other hand, were for 2017 only.There could be many reasons why Nigeria still has a high number of maternal deaths. Moller said women still had relatively low access to antenatal care, delivery by a skilled birth attendant, birth at a health facility, and care after birth.\n",

There was nothing false about the article. It was completely consistent with the CDC’s current count of deaths from all causes, which is right where it should be for week 47 with no excess deaths from COVID-19. This is 1984 on steroids https://t.co/eIqbOKwcA6 — Tom Mullen (@ThomasMullen) November 27, 2020 While it is true that The News-Letter retracted and unpublished the article on Nov. 26 over concerns that key points were inaccurately reported and contributed to the spread of misinformation, the publication shared an editorial update the following day explaining its decision and sharing a link to the article as a PDF with an overlay that reads “Retracted by The News-Letter. (For reference, a PDF of the article can be viewed here, and a web version has been archived here.) The article in question was written by science and technology writer Yanni Gu, who was a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine at the time. Gu interviewed Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master’s degree program, who was said to have “critically analyzed” the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. death using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a webinar given the same title of the article, “COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data.” According to Gu’s article, Briand sourced data from mid-March to mid-September that reported a total of 1.7 million deaths, about 200,000 of which were related to COVID-19. A link to this data was not made available in the article, but data published by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center showed that at least 200,000 people had reportedly died from the virus as of Sept. 21 (for comparison, total deaths had reached over 268,000 people at the time of this writing, Dec. 2). The article went on to push a narrative that has circulated since the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic that argues the CDC has falsely classified any death that could be related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths, rather than accounting for other potential causes or underlying conditions. (See other examples of similar falsities here, here, here, and here.) “Even patients dying from underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths,” wrote Gu. “This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease. Briand said in an interview with The News-Letter that her findings point “to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths,” and that “total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. When asked whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading by this presumed inflation, Briand responded by saying that the way in which the data was reported “doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification.” “In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes,” wrote Gu. Editors at The News-Letter wrote in a Nov. 27 note that Genevieve Briand’s presentation had been “used to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic. In response to criticism following the editorial staff’s decision to retract the article, the paper issued the following statement: In accordance with our standards for transparency, we are sharing with our readers how we came to this decision. The News-Letter is an editorially and financially independent, student-run publication. Our articles and content are not endorsed by the University or the School of Medicine, and our decision to retract this article was made independently. Briand’s study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As assistant director for the Master’s in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher. At her talk, she herself stated that more research and data are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S. The staff noted other inaccuracies in Briand’s claims that have been debunked and refuted by the broader medical community. For one, her claim that there is no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths did not take into account the spike in raw death count from all causes when compared to previous years. Furthermore, the CDC reported on Oct. 23 that an estimated 299,028 excess U.S. COVID-19 deaths occurred between late January through Oct. 3. “Additionally, Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic,” continued The News-Letter in its editor’s note. “This evidence does not disprove the severity of COVID-19; an increase in excess deaths is not represented in these proportionalities because they are offered as percentages, not raw numbers.” Removing misreported content has been a source of controversy in the journalism world, with groups like the Society of Professional Journalism and The Pointer Institute arguing that such actions reduce the transparency and credibility of a publication that does so.

            "[Evidences]:A post is being shared widely on Facebook with a photo of India today’s article on Amit Shah ‘s speech, with a claim that without Veer Savarkar, 1857 revolt wouldn’t become historic. The post also says that Savarkar was born in 1883. By mentioning Savarkar’s birth year, the post claims that Amit Shah has commented that Veer Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post The archived version of the post can be found here. Claim: Amit Shah has said that Veer Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. Fact: In a speech at Varanasi, Amit Shah said, “Had it not been for Veer Savarkar, the rebellion of 1857 would not have become history, we would have seen it from the point of view of Britishers. Veer Savarkar was the one who named the 1857 rebellion as the first independence struggle”. Amit Shah has not said in his speech that Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. The photo in the post was taken from the ‘India Today’s article. So when we looked into the article, it was found that Amit Shah has said in a speech at Varanasi that “without Veer Savarkar, revolt of 1857 wouldn’t become historic”. It was nowhere written in the article that Amit Shah has said that Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt.

            "[Evidences]:In making his case for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama cited statistics to argue that Americans have lost economic ground during the Bush administration. \"We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma,\" Obama said in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008. \"We measure progress in the 23-million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president, when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.\" We looked up the income numbers to see what happened to incomes during the Clinton years. We found Obama is correct that incomes went up under Clinton but dropped under Bush. But the numbers he uses aren't right. We looked to the U.S. Census reportIncome, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007.Numbers in the report are adjusted for inflation and reflect 2007 dollar values. The report indicates that median household income during the Bush administration dropped from $50,557 in 2000 to $50,233 in 2007, a decline of $324. Under Bill Clinton, median household income rose from $44,359 in 1992 to $50,557 in 2000, an increase of $6,198. The Obama campaign uses different numbers to calculate income. They look at households in which the age of the householder is under age 65. The campaign believes this more accurately reflects earnings power for workers, because seniors have Social Security income that automatically rises with inflation. During the course of our research, we found a commentary written by one of Obama's economic advisers that cited the numbers Obama used, with the caveat that it applied to \"working-age households.\" That would leave out seniors, and could conceivably change the numbers we found in the census. (The article didn't include a citation.) Obama didn't use the \"working-age\" caveat in his speech. Using those numbers, inflation-adjusted income goes from $51,039 in 1992 to $58,555 in 2000 to $56,545 in 2007. That comes to a drop of $2,010 during the Bush administration and an increase of $7,516 during the Clinton administration. (Note if you want to do your own calculations at home: Pull them from Census reports from the respective years, then use the more technical CPI-U-RS inflation calculator foundhere.) Having said all that, Obama didn't mention working-age families as part of his speech. Obama is right with the overall point he's making. Incomes did rise under Clinton and decline under Bush. But the numbers he uses don't include seniors, who today represent about 12 percent of the population. So we rate his statement only Half True. \n",

            "[Evidences]:President Donald Trump lobbed baseless claims that sought to discredit Georgia’s runoff election, hours after the results showed both Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate ahead. Decision desks and news outlets have called one race in favor of Democrat Raphael Warnock, who leads Sen. Kelly Loeffler by over 54,000 votes. As of this writing, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads Republican Sen. David Perdue in the second contest, which is closer. \"They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night,\" Trump tweeted Jan. 6. \"The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!\" Trump offered no evidence of wrongdoing in the count, and officials PolitiFact spoke to did not find any. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s Republican voting system implementation manager, tweeted in response to Trump: \"No Mr. President, there weren’t ‘found’ ballots.\" \"We have known the number of advanced votes since this weekend,\" Sterling continued. \"We saw record Election Day turnout. As of Monday 970,000 absentees had been accepted. 31k more were added in yesterday’s totals. That leaves 60k that came in yesterday.\" No Mr. President, there weren’t “found” ballots.

We talked about it at our last interview around 2 a.m. We don’t find 50,000. You count the 50,000 you had.\" In a press conference Jan. 6, Sterling said Trump was undermining faith in the election process. He said officials have known since the weekend that DeKalb County, east of Atlanta, already had about 171,000 early ballots, a point he also made on Twitter the night of the election. Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute, agreed that there is no evidence that Georgia election workers \"happened to find\" any improper votes. \"Election officials are following the law and processing ballots. Ballots do not just magically get processed,\" McReynolds told PolitiFact. \"It takes time and people and equipment to process ballots. Georgia officials are following the law and ensuring that every vote cast is counted.\" The Trump campaign and White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s inquiries. Trump’s comments about Georgia echoed similarly unsubstantiated allegations he lodged about the race he lost to Joe Biden in November. As PolitiFact reported, it’s typical for vote tallies to come in batches as counties report their results. This happened throughout the night of Georgia’s runoff election, the Associated Press reported. Trump said Georgia \"just happened to find\" 50,000 votes. That’s a ridiculous and inaccurate way to describe the counting of legally cast ballots. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!

            "[Evidences]:Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “In the 40, 50 years of the Endangered Species Act, we’ve recovered very few species. … The act itself hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.” — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, in an interview on Fox Business Network, Aug. 14 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Trump administration has finalized new rules to weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, a bedrock wildlife conservation law that bars the development of lands where at-risk species live. In a Fox Business interview, Wheeler defended the regulatory changes, stating that the ESA has “recovered very few species.” Government statistics show that 47 species of plants and animals deemed at risk under the ESA have been “recovered,” out of nearly 2,000 that have appeared on the list. But Wheeler is using a very strict definition of what it means to save a species from extinction. These conservation efforts work over many years, and not all species joined the list in 1973. The ESA could be helping a “threatened” or “endangered” species regrow its population significantly before U.S. officials classify it as “recovered” and take it off the list. The Facts President Richard M. Nixon signed the bipartisan Endangered Species Act following simpler conservation statutes passed in 1966 and 1969. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) administers the parts of the law that pertain to land and freshwater wildlife, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for most marine and anadromous wildlife. Advertisement A plant or animal breed can be listed as either “endangered” or “threatened” under the ESA after an assessment of its risk of extinction. “Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools are available to aid the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat,” according to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. “Among these legal tools are the ESA’s prohibition of unpermitted ‘take’ (e.g., killing, capturing, or harming) of endangered species and its requirement that agencies, in consultation with FWS or NMFS as applicable, ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.” The ESA routinely stirs debate, and Wheeler is not the first Republican official to question the law’s effectiveness by noting the relatively small number of delisted species. “While most demographic groups support species conservation to some degree, that support is stronger among urban and suburban populations and less so in rural areas, and is stronger among those along the coasts and less so in central and mountain states,” according to the CRS report, which adds that “some industries (e.g., logging and land development) generally see the ESA as a serious problem, while others (e.g., some commercial fishing and many recreation interests) see it as generally supporting their interests.” Advertisement As part of its deregulatory agenda to support such industries as oil and gas, the Trump administration has finalized new rules that could shrink the habitat set aside for wildlife while allowing more oil and gas drilling on those lands. The new regulations from the Commerce and Interior departments, which are not retroactive, also “remove tools that officials use to predict future harm to species as a result of climate change” and “reveal for the first time in the law’s 45-year history the financial costs of protecting” endangered or threatened species, as The Washington Post’s Darryl Fears reported Monday. Only Congress can change the wording of the law, but the executive branch has discretion to interpret what it says and how to enforce it. Therefore, regulatory changes can have big practical effects. As The Post reported, had the Trump administration’s new rules been in place in 2010, it would have been nearly impossible to designate the polar bear as a threatened species. The decision to add the polar bear to the list in 2010 was made because of melting sea ice in the Arctic. Advertisement The Trump administration’s regulatory changes are set to take effect in the coming weeks. Here’s a rundown of other key elements in the package, from The Post’s report on Monday: The new rules would also limit the area of land that can be protected to help species recover and survive. Currently, land that plants and animals occupy is set aside for their protection, in addition to areas that they once occupied or might need in the future. Now, critical habitat that is not occupied might not be protected, opening it up for oil and gas exploration or other forms of development. Another rule change stripped away language that said a secretary “shall make a [listing] determination solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information regarding a species’ status,” regardless of its costs. By removing that sentence, the administration allowed the interior and commerce secretaries to consider the economic impact of a listing. Potential threats to business opportunities and other costs can now be factored by the government and shared with the public. In the Fox Business interview, Wheeler defended the moves and said the ESA “hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.” “Administrator Wheeler’s statement is accurate, 47 out of 1,900 is considered ‘very few,’ ” said EPA spokesman Michael Abboud. As noted above, government statistics show that 47 species of plants and animals deemed at risk under the ESA have been “recovered” or taken off the list, out of nearly 2,000 that have appeared. Another 18 species are being considered for delisting. The ratio of listed-to-recovered species is low, but by focusing on that ratio, Wheeler takes a straitjacketed view of what it means to be successful in wildlife conservation. Advertisement Scientists have credited the ESA with bringing back from the brink of extinction such iconic species as the bald eagle, the grizzly bear, the California condor, the American alligator, the peregrine falcon, the humpback whale, the black-footed ferret, the Florida manatee, the Tennessee purple coneflower and others. As the Congressional Research Service found: The answer to this question [whether the ESA has been effective in saving endangered species] depends very much on the choice of measurement. A major goal of the ESA is the recovery of species to the point at which the protection of the ESA is no longer necessary. If this is the standard, the ESA might be considered a failure, because only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, as of July 25, 2016. Ten species have become extinct since their listing; eight have been delisted due to scientific reclassification of the species; and eleven have been delisted due to improved data, changes in the law, or improved scientific understanding. In the case of the species now believed extinct, some were originally listed to protect any last remaining few that might have been alive at the time of listing. It can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that, or in fact are already extinct. For example, two bird species, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the Eskimo curlew, are both listed as endangered, though confirmed sightings are so rare or so far in the past that these birds may actually be extinct; proving a negative (i.e., that such species do not exist any longer) is quite difficult. Rare species are, by definition, hard to find. Even so, because some scientific studies have demonstrated that most species are listed only once they are very depleted (e.g., median population of about 400 animals for vertebrates listed as endangered according to one study), another measure of effectiveness might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if the species is not actually delisted. If this is the standard, the ESA could be considered a success, since a relatively large number (41% of listed species according to one study) have improved or stabilized their population levels. One could also ask what species might have become extinct if there were no ESA: some species (e.g., red wolves and California condors) might not exist at all without the ESA protection, and this too might be considered a measure of success, even though the species are still rare. So, as of 2016, focusing on the number of delisted species produced a low success rate of less than 1 percent. But focusing on species that had improved or stabilized their population — short of the U.S. government’s threshold for delisting — produced a success rate of 41 percent, based on a 2015 study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. J. Michael Scott, an emeritus professor in the fish and wildlife department of the University of Idaho, previously told PolitiFact that studies suggest “more than half of the endangered and threatened populations are stable or improving, and that percentage increases with the length of time the species has been protected.” Advertisement In its fact check of former Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.), PolitiFact found that, as of 2013, “only one-half of 1 percent of species placed on the list have become extinct, which works out to a success rate of over 99 percent plus” and that “one could just as easily say that less than 1 percent of the species placed on the list have become extinct, and that many species have improved without being delisted.” Extinction, of course, is part of the circle of life. Ask the dinosaurs. But “many scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background extinction rates over time,” the CRS report noted. A Trump administration official said: “Delisting a species is the ultimate goal of ESA as it shows that the species is fully recovered with a strong scientific record. Settling for population improvements or some habitat recovery is not something this administration is willing to do. Recovery remains our ambitious goal.” The Pinocchio Test Wildlife conservation efforts take many years to work, and the U.S. government’s scientific threshold for a “recovered” species is set high. Advertisement Focusing on that metric, as Wheeler did, gives an incomplete view of how the Endangered Species Act works. Studies show that 40 percent to nearly half of at-risk species have improved or stabilized their populations under ESA protection. Many of these plants and animals may be delisted one day; some species may never be delisted and still be considered saved. Wheeler described the 47 delisted species out of nearly 2,000 as a low batting average. He said the law “hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species” and also said “we’ve recovered very few species.” Although his comments are technically accurate (especially when he uses the term “recovered,” which is the government’s term for delisted species), the EPA chief leaves out the population gains before species are delisted, which in many cases are substantial.

            "claim [Claim]: Obamacare granted \"the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) answered questions from \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski about the latest lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. \"The most important part of Obamacare, as you know, Mika, is the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer,\" he said. Because, as almost everyone agrees, health care is complicated, we decided to take a closer look at Coons’ statement, especially because much has been written and said — and put in campaign ads — about how many Americans have preexisting health conditions and how they gained insurance protections under the ACA. We will not attempt to judge Sen. Coons’ assertion that the ACA’s protection for people with preexisting conditions is \"the most important part\" of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes. We started out by contacting Coons’ office to get the background information on his assertion, but didn’t hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts. First came HIPAA What we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as \"job lock.\" That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods. \"HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University. Specifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status. Most of the states had already attempted to address the job-lock problem by the mid-1990s, but states could not reach the majority of the population with health insurance because they were covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. \"HIPAA basically ratified what most states had already done,\" said Joel Ario, a former Pennsylvania state insurance commissioner who helped implement the ACA for the federal government. HIPAA also tried to smooth the transition from employer-based insurance to individual coverage by requiring insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits. (COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, was a 1986 law that allowed workers to continue to purchase their employer plans at full cost for up to 18 months.) But HIPAA did not address how much insurers could charge for those plans, and many insurance companies tried to deter enrollment by making premiums unaffordable for nearly anyone who qualified. While the group-to-individual conversion problem was the most glaring gap in HIPAA, it was not the only one. HIPAA did not require employers to offer health coverage nor did it require those who did offer coverage to offer a minimum package of benefits. Most of those gaps were addressed by the ACA. It effectively required large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits (or else pay a substantial fine). The ACA also, for the first time, required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions — without charging them more. Much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated. Our ruling In this statement, Coons suggested that that ACA provided pre-existing condition protections to the more than 150 million Americans who get their health coverage through their place of employment. But that is not completely correct.Those were already in place through HIPAA, though expanded by the ACA. We rate Coons’ statement as Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Whether on the national stage or back home in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie often peppers the crowd with statistics while describing the fiscal woes of New Jersey before he took office.Among his arsenal of numbers is the rate of increase in the state’s property tax bills. At an Oct. 16 town hall meeting in West Milford, Christie unsheathed that figure as he said his reforms are constraining property taxes.\"We're announcing $116 million dollars today in additional savings to local governments statewide. Here's why. The savings are possible because of the reforms we put in place: 2 percent cap on property taxes. The property tax rates are starting to come in from across the state. They came in from Burlington County the other day, 1.7 percent increase countywide in property taxes. The cap's working,\" he said. \"Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor. So you’re having [a] 7 percent a year average.\"Did New Jersey’s property taxes -- the nation’s highest -- jump by 70 percent in a decade? Homeowners may not be surprised to learn that the increase was actually slightly more. Though, when property tax rebates are factored in, the increase is roughly 50 percent.Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail that the governor’s statement is \"unequivocally true and a glaring illustration of the uncontrolled rise in property taxes in the decade before we arrived in Trenton -- caused by unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level.\"The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs.By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280.That’s a more than 71 percent increase.But there’s also another chapter to the story of New Jersey’s property taxes: rebates.In previous fact-checks, experts told us reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they’re intended to reduce the property tax burden of homeowners.In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111.By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037.When you deduct those rebates from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office is less than 70 percent.In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent.It’s worth noting Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebates came as a credit deducted off property tax bills.In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519.Our rulingChristie said: \"property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor.\"In the decade before Christie took office, the average property tax bill climbed more than 70 percent, from roughly $4,240 to about $7,280.But when property tax rebates are taken into account, the increase is less, jumping roughly 50 percent in a decade.Either way, Christie is on point that property taxes increased significantly from 1999 to 2009.We rate this statement Mostly True.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share “There have been eight publicly reported murders by MS-13 in Northern Virginia alone. And there’s more than 2,000 MS-13 gang members just in Fairfax County, and this is a growing problem.” — Ed Gillespie (R), Virginia gubernatorial candidate, interview on the J.R. Hoeft Show, Oct. 21, 2017 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “We know that there are more than 2,000 MS-13 gang members in Fairfax County alone. … MS-13 is surging, not just in Northern Virginia but other parts of the Commonwealth too.” — Gillespie, in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch editorial board, Oct. 18 “I don’t have the numbers for Loudoun, I have the numbers for Fairfax where I live. There are more than 2,000 MS-13 gang members in Fairfax County alone.” — Gillespie, interview with the Loudoun Times-Mirror, Oct. 14 In the tight race for Virginia governor between Gillespie and Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D), Gillespie has made the threat posed by the MS-13 street gang a major part of his campaign. We had earlier examined one of his commercials on this, which we found to be misleading. (We also knocked one of Northam’s ads attacking Gillespie’s career as a lobbyist.) Advertisement In recent weeks, Gillespie has begun to assert that there are more than 2,000 MS-13 gang members in Fairfax County. We wondered whether there was much evidence to support this figure. The Facts MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a Central American gang that has been operating in the United States for decades. The transnational gang formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s, among members of the Salvadoran community who had fled violence and civil conflict in El Salvador. U.S. agencies have been dealing with enforcement and prevention of MS-13 activities since as early as 2004. MS-13, which operates in at least 40 states, is violent, but much of it is gang-on-gang violence. Gang violence in Central America’s Northern Triangle region (El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala) has contributed to the surge in recent years of crossings by unaccompanied children and families over the Southwestern border into the United States. Advertisement Fairfax County, meanwhile, has an estimated population of more than 1.13 million in 2016, of which 16.4 percent (185,166) are Hispanic. Fairfax County is the third wealthiest county in the United States, with a median household income of nearly $113,000. In context, 2,000 gang members out of more than 1 million people — especially if it is isolated to small pockets and restricted to gang-on-gang violence — is a relatively small number. But let’s see what evidence exists. The Gillespie campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment, which is clearly suspicious. Obviously, there is no census taken of gang members. The population is relatively transient and not easily identified. So any figures must be taken with a grain of salt. The Justice Department has offered varying estimates for the number of MS-13 gang members in the United States, ranging from 6,000 to 10,000. The Trump administration has suggested MS-13 membership has climbed in recent years, offering a 10,000 estimate in April. But FactCheck.Org found that the Justice Department has been citing a 10,000 member figure since at least 2006, indicating there has been little apparent growth. Advertisement A Fairfax County assessment in June, meanwhile, cited a 2015 police intelligence estimate that there are 2,000 gang members in the county, with the police identifying 80 different gangs. The Fairfax County report cited a 2015 youth survey, which found slightly more than 2 percent of high school students indicating membership in a gang – a figure that had dropped in half since 2008. Police officials were unable to immediately provide a further breakdown of gang members, including what percentage might be MS-13. [Update: After this article appeared, a police spokesman said the “best estimate is that around 70 percent of all our gang-involved persons are affiliated with MS-13.” That would mean 1,400.] But the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told The Washington Post in June that the estimated membership of MS-13 in the D.C. region — including Virginia, Maryland and the District — was between 900 and 1,100. Advertisement That’s certainly less than 2,000, and it’s for more than Fairfax County. The D.C. region has a population of 6 million. But there’s a wrinkle. In 2009, the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force issued a report in which it estimated that there were 3,000 MS-13 gang members in the NoVa region, an area with roughly 2.5 million people. Fairfax County is obviously the largest part of the region — about half the population — and the report said MS-13 was the largest gang in the county. Jay Lanham, a retired assistant chief of the Prince William County police and executive director of the task force, told WTOP in June that the number of MS-13 members was now “over 5,000 easy.” But when we reached Lanham, he backed away from the number. “They are so transient,” Lanham said. “It’s really just an estimate.” The task force maintains a database funded by the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, but he acknowledged it’s difficult to know if members listed in the database have left the area or are no longer in the gang. Advertisement Still, Lanham thought a figure of 2,000 MS-13 gang members for Fairfax was “probably pretty accurate” given the size of the county. Gillespie, of course, often says “more than 2,000.” We should note that Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force has had its funding cut dramatically by Congress, from $3 million in 2012 to $325,000 currently. Lawmakers have cited its estimates — higher than police estimates — as a reason to bolster funding. “Most of the estimates from the police department are going to be on the low side,” Lanham said. Still, it’s strange that DOJ estimates would suggest there has been no gain in MS-13 membership across the United States over 10 years, while the Northern Virginia task force would claim membership in the region would nearly double in eight years. The Pinocchio Test Despite Gillespie’s certitude, the plain fact is that no one knows how many MS-13 gang members are in Fairfax County. Advertisement Gillespie is citing the highest possible estimate, in an effort to make the situation seem as bad as possible, particularly for people in vote-rich Fairfax County. In fact, under Gillespie’s math, Fairfax County by itself accounted for more than one-fifth of all of the MS-13 members in the United States, given the Justice Department figure of 10,000 MS-13 members nationwide. ICE, meanwhile, indicates the entire D. C. region represents just one-tenth of the MS-13 membership. That would suggest Fairfax County has less than 1/20th of the MS-13 population. Both Fairfax County police and ICE estimates for the region are much lower than the number Gillespie is touting on the campaign trail — a fact that he should acknowledge. We wavered between two and three Pinocchios, given how Gillespie hypes this figure. But we ultimately settled on two because Lanham offered some backing for Gillespie’s statement, despite the much lower estimates by other official sources.

            "claim [Claim]: After laying off 30,000 people,Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, \"I would have done them all faster.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, announced on May 4, 2015, that she’d be running for president as a Republican. But a cyber-squatter had moved fast to grab the Web address carlyfiorina.org and flame her. Using a simple gray-and-white color scheme and uninspired fonts, the domain owner recalled Fiorina’s controversial six-year tenure as CEO of the computer maker by addressing visitors to the page this way: \"Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. \"So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard. \"It was this many:\" At that point, a very long list of frowny-face icons begins. After much scrolling, the page concludes: \"That's 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently? \" ‘I would have done them all faster.’ \"—Carly Fiorina\" Is the cyber-squatter -- who didn’t identify themselves on the site -- correct? The 30,000 number is largely accurate (we fact-checked it back in 2010), but we wondered whether it’s correct that Fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster. First, some background. Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Her actions at HP spawned detractors as well as defenders. We looked at the numerical part of the claim in 2010, the year Fiorina ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The charge was made in an attack ad by Boxer. We found that Fiorina herself cited the 30,000-layoff figure in an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006. \"When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from.\" Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry. Their official website, by the way, is www.carlyforpresident.com. But did Fiorina say that she wishes she’d done those 30,000 layoffs \"faster\"? This is more problematic. It stems from a 2005 article in Fortune magazine (reprinted here in 2011). The comment came in a section devoted to the departure of some of the company’s senior executives after the merger. Here’s an excerpt: \"Fiorina summarily fired — within hours — the head of enterprise sales, Peter Blackmore, and two of his senior executives. The speed and visibility of the move caused the tech industry to view the firings as an unnecessarily cruel public hanging, and criticism of Fiorina flared. She argues back, saying that a hanging it wasn’t and that in truth these people were treated, in the usual HP manner, with ‘respect, candor, and compassion.’ But she also says that some of the European problems had been ripening for a time and that these three very senior executives clearly ‘dropped the ball.’ She believes in accountability, she says, so the men are gone. … \"Under Fiorina (HP) has lost — via firings, resignations, and retirements — a noticeable number of its top people. Here’s one indicator of what some people call the ‘brain drain’: Of the 11 ‘direct reports’ that Fiorina had in October 2003, one died and five others are gone. Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq when the merger was done, left early. Former HP employees can also, without much effort, list another 20 well-placed executives who have departed, a few of them going to competitors Dell and storage company EMC. \"Fiorina does not agree, naturally, that there’s been a brain drain. In fact, she believes that one lesson she’s learned while running HP is that she should have moved more quickly in ejecting certain people. Smartened up now, she says, ‘I would have done them all faster. Every person that I’ve asked to leave, whether it’s been clear publicly or not, I would have done faster.’ \" This puts Fiorina’s comment in a somewhat different light. Rather than musing that she should have laid off 30,000 people faster, the full article suggests she’s referring to a select group of high-ranking executives. Our ruling The cyber-squatter site claims that after laying off \"30,000 people,\" Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, \"I would have done them all faster.\" While the number is accurate -- acknowledged in a 2006 interview by Fiorina -- the comment that \"I would have done them all faster\" is pulled out of context. In fact, Fiorina was more specifically referring to her decisions to force out a small number of top-level executives, not tens of thousands of rank-and-file employees. The claim is partially accurate, but takes some things out of context, so we rate it Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share “The numbers are clear. The U.S. government has certified that at least 700,000 Americans have lost their jobs due to changing trade flows resulting from NAFTA. Many people believe that the number is much, much bigger than that.” — United States Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, remarks on NAFTA renegotiation, Aug. 16 When the United States, Canada and Mexico launched talks on renegotiating NAFTA, we were surprised to see U. S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer assert that the U.S. government had “certified” 700,000 Americans had lost their jobs because of the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Trump is a fierce critic of NAFTA — presumably he is one of the people who thinks the number is “much, much bigger” — but in our many years of covering economics we had never seen such a figure attributed to the U.S. government, let alone one that was “certified.” Such numbers are more commonly associated with left-leaning critics of the deal, not the federal government. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued an extensive review of literature and simply noted a wide range of estimated impacts, depending on the political perspective or type of research. The report soberly referenced studies that showed the “mixed and nuanced nature of NAFTA’s estimated impacts on aggregate employment” without concluding there was a definitive estimate. Advertisement What’s going on here? The Facts NAFTA took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, nearly 24 years ago. So, on the face of it, 700,000 jobs over a quarter-century does not seem like much. That’s about 30,000 jobs a year, which is a drop in the bucket of an economy with nearly 130 million full-time jobs. Just between 2009 and 2011, 6 million workers were displaced from jobs they held for more than three years, largely because factories moved away or closed, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates. So Lighthizer is touting a number that is minuscule in absolute terms and negligible in percentage terms. It turns out this is a rather outdated number. An official at the trade representative’s office said the number reflected trade adjustment assistance petitions accepted by the Labor Department because of job displacement from trade agreements between Jan. 1, 1994, and Jan. 1, 2001. In that period, about 757,000 petitions were certified. Advertisement Lighthizer’s figure thus covers the first seven years of NAFTA, but does not include later data that might have been affected by China’s admission to the World Trade Organization. The official said the USTR also turned to a 2010 estimate by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning organization, that estimated job losses of 700,000 due to U.S.-Mexico trade. (EPI actually has an updated 2013 estimate of 851,700 displaced jobs with both Mexico and Canada, but its methodology has been criticized as really meaning jobs changed by trade, not lost.) “We sought to be cautious and use a figure lower than 757,000, even though that figure covers only the first 7 years of NAFTA,” the USTR official said. But this is not really cautious but actually rather misleading. USTR is only counting job losses — and ignoring any possible job gains from the rise in U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada. The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 billion in exports in goods supports 5,300 jobs, which roughly translates into an additional 1.8 million jobs in the United States from the increase in trade with Mexico and Canada since 1994, even before calculating the impact from trade in services. Advertisement As we have noted before, most mainstream economists do not believe the number of jobs is significantly affected by trade policy; instead, trade changes the mix of jobs. That obviously creates winners and losers, but Trump’s USTR is only focusing on the losers, which the official acknowledged. “The data reference was not an assessment of net gains or losses, but focused on the number of Americans who were certified by the Department of Labor as losing their jobs due to NAFTA,” the official said, adding that Lighthizer did note that “many Americans have benefited from NAFTA,” including in the agriculture and services sectors. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has closely examined NAFTA and concluded that “overall net effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy has been relatively small.” The report noted that “U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada was already growing before NAFTA and it likely would have continued to do so without an agreement.” Moreover, it is difficult to isolate the actual impact of NAFTA from other economic factors that affect job creation and job loss. While Trump has railed about the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico in particular, CRS said that trade in crude oil and petroleum products distorts the deficit numbers. “If these products are excluded from the trade balance, the deficit with NAFTA partners has been lower than the overall deficit in some years. In some years, the balance in nonenergy merchandise has been positive,” CRS said. Advertisement CRS concluded: “In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment.” Lighthizer is especially skating on thin ice by calling this a “certified” figure, which appears to be an effort to attach some authoritative weight to it. Not only are the numbers 16 years old, but there are strong reasons to suspect they inflate the impact of NAFTA. The Wall Street Journal in 1997 reported that a survey of employers whose employees who had been “certified” as having lost their jobs because of NAFTA found many examples in which the trade deal played no role. The Labor Department was just bending over backward to award benefits to laid-off workers. A sawmill in Port Gamble, Wash., closed because its timber supply dwindled from efforts to save the spotted owl, so company officials were “dumbfounded” when the Labor Department certified every laid-off worker as a victim of NAFTA. “If anyone can find some legitimate connection to NAFTA in this, I’d sure like to see it,” a former manager said. The newspaper turned up numerous other examples of dubious “certified” claims, including 874 workers whose factory moved to Mexico in 1992, before NAFTA went into effect, because of competition from Japan. The Pinocchio Test To recap, Lighthizer touted a statistic derived from fuzzy data that was 16 years old — and which ignored the positive impact of trade with Mexico and Canada. In doing so, he sidesteps the fact that most economists believe the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy was relatively modest and trade imbalances are relatively small, especially if oil products are excluded. His figure is offered without context and thus is rather misleading. Lighthizer pushed this into Four-Pinocchio territory by stating such a misleading number was “certified” by the U.S. government and could well be “much, much bigger.” In doing so, he suggests this fanciful bit of spin was vetted by government experts.

Back then, the picture was said to show the skies over California, where a huge wildfire was then burning in that state. What we found was that the picture was snapped by a meteorologist and actually captured a sunset somewhere over Hawaiian waters, and that the red tinting was a natural atmospheric phenomenon that had nothing to do with fires of any sort: I managed to contact the persons who posted/took the viral sunset photograph.

            "[Evidences]:The one-minute, 57-second video was posted here on Facebook on July 25, 2021. It had been viewed more than 400 times before it was removed. The post's Indonesian-language caption reads in part: \"China's armory exploded in a fire this morning... \"Flash Flood was on Saturday, 19th, now the armory is destroyed, may Allah destroy everything... Amen.\" Text in traditional Chinese characters that appears throughout the video reads: \"Big blast at a Japanese chemical plant in Thailand\". The same video was also shared on Facebook here and here, alongside a similar claim. The video was also posted here with a claim that it shows an explosion at an aluminium factory in China. Floods in central China's Henan province in July 2021 killed at least 71 people, including 14 who were trapped in a flooded subway in the city of Zhengzhou, AFP reported here. An aluminium alloy plant in Henan province exploded on July 20, 2021, after flood waters entered the plant, as reported here and here. However, the claims are false. A combination of reverse image and keyword searches found the video comprises four different clips that show three different incidents in Lebanon, Thailand and South Korea. The first clip The first clip matches the scenes in this video posted by France-based Berbere Television, on Facebook on August 4, 2020, titled: \"Explosions in Beirut\". Translated from French, the post's caption reads: \"Explosions in Beirut - A strong explosion rocked the port area of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, at around 5:10 p.m. (1:10 a.m. local time) on Tuesday, leaving dozens injured, according to a security source and correspondents from Agence France-Presse (AFP) on the ground.\" AFP also published a video report of the blast in Beirut here on YouTube on August 4, 2020. The massive explosion killed more than 100 people, wounded thousands and left 300,000 homeless, AFP reported here. Below is the screenshot comparison between the first misleading clip (L) and the Berbere Television video (R): The second clip The second clip is a CCTV footage capturing the moment when a factory exploded in Samut Prakan province, Thailand, on July 5, 2021, which can be seen in this video, published on the website of video licensing agency Newsflare. The video's headline reads: \"Terrifying moment couple watching TV see room EXPLODE from factory blast in Thailand.\" The accident killed one firefighter and injuring at least 33 people, AFP reported here. Below is a screenshot comparison between the second misleading clip (L) and the Newsflare video (R): The third clip The third clip match the scenes seen in this YouTube video posted on July 6, 2021. Translated from Thai to English, the post's title reads: \"Ming Dih chemical factory explosion\". The Thai text superimposed on the video says: \"Fire at Ming Dih chemical factory, Samut Prakan\". The Taiwan-owned Ming Dih chemical factory in Samut Prakan province, Thailand, was destroyed following an explosion on July 5, 2021, the Bangkok Post reported here. Thai Rath newspaper also published a picture in the report about the explosion here, showing the same scene as seen in the third clip. Below is a screenshot comparison between the third misleading clip (L) and the genuine YouTube video (R): The fourth clip The fourth clip shows the same scenes in this video uploaded on YouTube on July 3, 2021. Translated from Korean to English, the YouTube post is titled: \"Major fire breaks out at Kumho Chemical Industry in Sihwa Industrial Complex.\" The first paragraph of the post's caption reads: \"At around 9:57 pm on the 2nd, a major fire broke out at at the Kumho Chemical Industry, a polyurethane manufacturer, in Sihwa Industrial Complex, and the fire was not completely put out until around four hours later at 2:00 am on the 3rd.\" Chosun Ilbo, a major South Korean daily, included the video in this report about the blast in Sihwa Industrial Complex in South Korea's Gyeonggi province. National news channel YTN also reported on the blast here on July 3, 2021.

            "claim [Claim]: There are \"500 failing schools in North Carolina\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In vouching for a law that would allow some struggling public schools to be taken over by charter schools, the state chapter of the conservative group Americans For Prosperity said one in every five North Carolina public schools is failing. \"This Achievement School District legislation is a small first step testing one approach to the long-overdue process of improving 500 failing schools in North Carolina,\" wrote AFP’s North Carolina director, Donald Bryson, on the group’s website. North Carolina has 2,583 public schools, including 148 charter schools. So if Bryson is right about 500 failing schools, that means nearly 20 percent of schools fall into that category. His proposed solution, a relatively new and controversial program called an achievement school district, or ASD, is moving forward in North Carolina. The ASD program was approved by the N.C. House on June 2 (the day after Bryson published his argument) and is now up for a vote in the Senate. The idea is to take a handful of the lowest-performing schools away from their districts and turn them over to charter school operators. Bryson said it’s noteworthy that there are 500 failing schools because such schools \"remain broken education communities, systematically failing to teach tens of thousands of students without any path towards meaningful, long-term reform or improved achievement.\" We wondered if the picture was really so bleak. How many schools are failing? The state has give out school grades since the 2013-14 school year. Last year,146 schools received Fs. That’s a far cry from 500, so we asked Bryson where his number came from. He said he was actually underestimating it – that there are 547 low-performing schools, according to a state law that defines the term. However, \"low-performing\" is not the same as \"failing\" –the law that Bryson cited includes F schools as well as D schools. And as any slacker can tell you, D’s get degrees. For Bryson to count D schools as failing seems to be self-evidently wrong. But that’s not the whole story. The state gave its schools a grading scale that we all would’ve loved to have had ourselves. While a typical grading scale gives any score below 60 an F and then goes up by 10-point intervals, North Carolina uses the following scale to grade its schools: F: 0-39 D: 40-54 C: 55-69 B: 70-84 A: 85-100 The scores are mostly based on how students do on standardized tests, with a small amount of consideration given to whether the schools met their expected student growth goals. Grades for high schools also include factors like graduation rates. If the state used a traditional scale, every D school (and even some C schools) would have instead received an F. That’s a pretty good argument in Bryson’s favor. We decided we needed to talk to an expert on education policy to determine whether the state had a good reason to give itself this scale, or if it was simply protecting its image. Eric Houck is a former public school teacher who now teaches education policy at UNC-Chapel Hill. He said many academics, including himself, don’t really pay attention to school grades – including the question of whether the scale is too generous. The rubric doesn’t give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, Houck said, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. He said that punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level and largely ignores how well teachers did getting those students caught up. \"The entire grading system is a little suspect in terms of being able to accurately identify what schools are actually failing,\" he said. Using growth to measure schools The \"low-performing\" metric that Bryson cited includes all D and F schools that didn’t meet their growth goals, as well as those that met their growth goals. Those that exceeded their growth goals are not considered low-performing. That’s a bit more in line with Houck’s philosophy on how to best judge schools, but it’s still misleading to say all those students are being left behind. By equating \"low-performing\" with \"failing,\" Bryson’s claim considers a school to be failing if its average student is a D student whose scoresare improving as much as the state expects. A reasonable person wouldn’t say that student is failing. He’s below average, but above the threshold for failure and on track for improvement. And nearly half of the schools Bryson is talking about, 225 of them, arein that category. Paying a bit more attention to growth, like Houck suggested, we found that a better estimate of the number of failing schools could range from 80 to 415, depending on how much you trust the state to have given itself a fair grading scale. 80: The number of F schools in 2014-15 that did not meet their expected growth. 146: The number of F schoolsin 2014-15. 299: The number of low-performing schools that did not meet their expected growth (out of 547 total low-performing schools). 415: The number of schools that scored 59 or below in 2014-15 and thus would’ve received an F on a traditional grading scale, and which also didn’t meet growth goals. Our ruling It’s hard to say exactlyhow many failing schools are in North Carolina, but we do know there are not 500 like AFP state director Donald Bryson said. He was referring to low-performing schools, but the majority of low-performing schools are D schools – which most people don’t consider failing. We counted failing schools in a number of ways, with the results ranging from 80 to 415 depending on the grading scale used to define what an F is. Any way you slice itthere are clearly dozens, and maybehundreds, of failing schools statewide. Bryson’s statement was overly broad, but it’s not totally wrong. We rate this claim Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"About 70 percentof Republicans nationwide ...don't think Donald Trump is the right guy\" to take on Hillary Clinton in November.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Don’t let Donald Trump’s win in South Carolina fool you, says Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.The good majority of Republicans don’t actually support the frontrunner. Cruz made the case against Trump’s inevitability on NBC’s Meet the Press and argued that he, Cruz, was actually the best candidate for the job. \"For anyone who doesn't believe that Donald Trump is the best candidate to go head to head with Hillary Clinton in November, and that's about 70 percent of Republicans nationwide who don't think Donald Trump is the right guy,\" Cruz said on Feb. 21. \"Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump and that can beat Donald Trump.\" This rosy forecast caught our attention (as well as the attention of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who made a similar claim on CBS’sFace the Nation). Is it true that 70 percent of Republicans \"don’t think Donald Trump is the right guy?\" The Cruz campaign referred us to Trump’s Real Clear Politics polling average of 34.2 percent, as of Feb. 17, 2016. This figure represents the portion of Republican primary voters who prefer Trump as the party’s nominee. \"The point is, close to 70 percent of Republicans are choosing someone else,\" said Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips. True. But by this logic, about 80 percent of Republicans don’t think Cruz — who’s polling at an average of 20.6 percent — \"is the right guy\" either. Here’s a breakdown of the latest polls: Date Trump Cruz Rubio Fox News Feb. 15-17 36 19 15 NBC/Wall Street Journal Feb. 14-16 26 28 17 CBS Feb. 12-16 36 19 12 USA Today/Suffolk Feb. 11-15 35 20 17 Quinnipiac Feb. 10-15 39 18 19 The Economist/YouGov* Feb. 11-15 39 19 16 Cruz’s interpretation leaves out some nuance. Even though Trump isn’t the top pick for many Republican primary voters, a good chunk of them would be perfectly happy with him (or Cruz or Rubio for that matter) as the party’s nominee. Trump was the first or second choice for 47 percent of Republicans in a Fox News poll, for 38 percent in a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for 44 percent in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll and for 52 percent in The Economist/YouGov poll. A similar portion of GOP voters (39 to 45 percent) named Cruz and Rubio as their top two picks. Trump is also viewed favorably by most of the party: about 62 percent of Republican voters in a Quinnipiac University poll and 62 percent inThe Economist/YouGov poll. Cruz and Rubio commanded similar numbers. Conversely, in the Quinnipiac poll, more Republicans (31 percent) had an unfavorable opinion of Trump than Cruz or Rubio (23 percent). The three men clocked similar numbers in TheEconomist/YouGov poll. Trump does the worst when voters are askedif they could see themselves supporting him for the nomination. In a Feb. 17NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 42 percent of Republicans said no. In comparison, 33 percent could not see themselves supporting Cruz, and 28 percent said the same about Rubio. And finally, most Republicans would support any of the three men if they were the party’s nominee according to a CBS poll. But about a fifth of Republican voters said they wouldn’t back Trump (20 percent), Cruz (18 percent) or Rubio (17 percent) no matter what. Our ruling Cruz said, 70 percent of Republicans nationwide \"don't think Donald Trump is the right guy\" to take on Hillary Clinton in November. Cruz is referring to the polling average of 34 percent of GOP voters who say Trump is their top choice. Inverted, 66 percent of Republicans prefer someone else. That doesn’t mean, however, that the 66 percent refuse to support Trump overall. The highest estimate we found for Republicans flat-out protesting Trump is 42 percent. Cruz’s statement is largely accurate but leaves out some context. We rate it Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Democrats’ two-year control of the Ohio House of Representatives came to an abrupt end with the Nov. 2 election. Republicans dominated, winning the governor’s office, all other statewide executive offices and control of the House. What impact the Republican takeover of the House will have on the average Ohioan is unknown, but one thing seems clear: House members, coming off an election year with an extended summer break, will be called to work more often under the new leadership. Republican state Rep. Bill Batchelder, who will take over as Ohio House speaker in January, was outspoken during the campaign about the House's productivity under Democratic leadership. He pointed to the high number of legislative sessions House Speaker Armond Budish canceled. \"We haven’t had control of the House for the last two years and it’s been malfunctioning,\" Batchelder, of Medina, told the Brunswick Sun News in mid-October. \"We had 109 sessions scheduled and held 49.\" Given his critique of Budish, it will be worth checking how often Batchelder, once he becomes House speaker, cancels scheduled House sessions. But PolitiFact Ohio thought we first should make sure Batchelder’s figures for the last two years are accurate. If he is correct, the number of House sessions convened in 2009 and 2010 will be the lowest two-year total in recent years. The House had 78 sessions in 2005-06 and 71 sessions in 2007-08, according to the House clerk’s office. The House speaker publishes a schedule of planned sessions every six months. The speaker, under the rules of the House, also has the authority to cancel or add session dates as necessary. Budish, a Democrat from Beachwood, became House speaker at the beginning of 2009, after the Democrats took control of the Ohio House in the 2008 election. In 2009, Budish scheduled 74 session days and cancelled 43 times, leaving 31 days the House actually held session, according to figures provided by Batchelder and confirmed by Budish’s office. Batchelder and Budish also agree on figures for this year. Through Nov. 5, Budish had scheduled 35 session days and actually held session 17 times, according to their offices. The sum of those figures aligns closely with Batchelder’s statement to the newspaper. The number of scheduled session days is a match at 109. He is off by one on the number of actual sessions held. He said 49 but his office now agrees that 48 sessions were held in the last two years. Batchelder was counting a day the legislature met – but did not hold session – on the day of the governor’s State of the State address. While Budish’s office agrees with Batchelder’s numbers, it has a different interpretation of their meaning. Budish spokesman Keary McCarthy said the number of canceled sessions is not an indication that the House has malfunctioned in the past two years. He mentioned passage of a two-year state budget and work on legislation to help create jobs. McCarthy can disagree with Batchelder’s attack on the House’s productivity under Budish’s leadership, but he can’t really quibble with the number of canceled sessions Batchelder claimed. He was off by one in his total of actual sessions, but that miscalculation was insignificant. We rate Batchelder's claim as True. Comment on this item.\n",

Click here, here, here, and here.The issue of the prime minister's educational qualification was raked up once again after a recent ruling of the Gujarat High Court. The high court ruled in favour of Gujarat University which challenged a 2016 order by the Chief Information Commission (CIC) to make public the PM's degree. The CIC's order was in response to a Right To Information (RTI) request made by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The high court ruled in favour of the university and imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000 on Kejriwal. Read more about it here.Since then multiple opposition leaders have questioned the authenticity of the prime minister's degreeIn 2016, the BJP released photocopies of the prime minister's Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree certificate from Delhi University and Master of Arts (MA) degree certificate from Gujarat University. The photocopy of the MA certificate states that it is a duplicate copy and also shows the signature of KS Shastri Click here.FACT CHECKWithout getting into the authenticity of the degree, our findings show the claim that former Vice Chancellor KS Shastri, whose signature is seen on the prime minister's Master's degree certificate copy, died in 1981 is false.The dates mentioned in the image show Shastri's tenure at another university and not his date of birth and date of his death.Using search operators we did a boolean search with the keywords \"KS Shastri\" AND \"Gujarat University\", which showed us a PDF document by Gujarat University listing previous vice-chancellors of the university.The PDF shows Professor KS Shastri was Gujarat University's Chancellor from 1981 to 1987.

Auch so ließe sich die Explosion der Fallzahlen in Saudi-Arabien erklären.“/n/nDrosten betonte auch im Februar 2020, asymptomatische Personen massenhaft zu testen, sei nicht sinnvoll/n/nChristian Drostens Aussagen zur aktuellen Corona-Pandemie stehen nicht im Widerspruch zu 2014. Er hat in seinem Podcast mit demNDRimmer wieder auch über PCR-Tests gesprochen. Dabei sagte er selbstam 28. Februar 2020, es sei „Unsinn“, asymptomatische Patienten in der breiten Bevölkerung zu testen: „Wir handeln uns große Probleme ein, wenn wir anfangen, asymptomatische Personen ohne eine ganz klare Kontakt-Anamnese mit Labortests zu versorgen. Das heißt: Ich habe mit einem bestätigten Fall in seiner infektiösen Zeit Kontakt gehabt für ausreichende Zeit. Also zum Beispiel, eine Viertelstunde habe ich mich mit dem unterhalten. Dann bin ich ein Kontakt-Fall. Und dann kann man mich auch asymptomatisch testen. Dann fängt es an, Sinn zu machen.“/n/nZudem wies Drosten damals auf das Problem möglicher falsch positiver Ergebnisse hin. Er betonte auch, Labor-Kapazitäten müssten geschont werden./n/nDie Zahl der falsch-positiven Ergebnisse ist in der Praxis allerdings sehr niedrig, wie die Virologin Sandra Ciesek ebenfalls imNDR-Podcastmit einer Studie belegte. Sie sagte am 17. November 2020: „Also, wir haben über 13.000 PCRs gemacht fürdiese Studie. Und haben zwei positive Ergebnisse mitgeteilt. Es wird immer behauptet, dass alle PCRs falsch seien oder so viel falsch positive Befunde bringen würden. Das kann ich mit dieser Studie ausschließen.“ (Mehr über falsch-positive Tests lesen Siehier.)/n/nNein, der PCR-Test kreuzreagiert nicht mit vielen anderen Viren/n/nInfo-Direktverlinkte zudem eineneigenen Textals Quelle mit der Behauptung, Drosten habe zu Beginn der Corona-Pandemie erklärt, dass es beim Test „auf jeden Fall“ zu Kreuzreaktionen mit anderen Viren käme. Das ist irreführend./n/nAls Quelle diente hier offenbar wiederum ein Zitat von Drosten aus der Folge desNDR-Podcasts vom 18. März. Wenn man sich dieses komplett anhört, wird jedoch deutlich, dass Drosten Kreuzreaktionen des Tests auf SARS-CoV-2 mit anderen menschlichen Coronaviren ausschließt./n/nEr sagte: „Es stimmt, aber das ist natürlich eine vollkommen irreführende Information, rein theoretisch würde dieser Test gegen das alte SARS-Coronavirus reagieren. Dasgibt es aber seit 16 Jahren nicht mehr beim Menschen. Und rein theoretisch würde dieser Test auch gegen eine ganze Reihe von Fledermaus-Coronaviren reagieren, aber die gibt es auch nicht beim Menschen. Und genauso ist es zum Beispiel, wenn wir uns jetzt andere Erkältungs-Coronavirus-Teste anschauen. Es gibt zum Beispiel ein Coronavirus beim Menschen, ein Erkältungs-Coronavirus, da würde der Test auf jeden Fall auch kreuzreagieren, gegen ein Coronavirus des Rindes, das beim Rind Durchfall macht, diese Viren sind sehr ähnlich. Und noch ein anderes, das würde kreuzreagieren gegen ein Coronavirus des Kamels. Und damit meine ich nicht das MERS-Virus, sondern ein anderes unserer normalen Erkältungsviren. Aber das hat mit der medizinischen Diagnostik und derWertigkeit der Daten für die Epidemiologie überhaupt keine Bewandtnis. Wir testen mit diesem Test nur das neue Coronavirus beim Menschen. Wenn wir eine Patientenprobe testen und Date [sic] ist positiv, dann ist es dieses neue Coronavirus und auf gar keinen Fall eins der bekannten anderen Coronaviren.“ (NDR-Podcast Folge 16,Transkript Seite 3)./n/nDrosten sprach also nicht von einer großen Anzahl Viren, die bei aktuellen PCR-Tests auf SARS-CoV-2 für Kreuzreaktionen infrage kämen, sondern eigentlich nur von einem: dem ersten SARS-Virus, das seit 16 Jahren nicht mehr bei einem Menschen nachgewiesen wurde. Andere Erkältungs-Coronaviren, die Menschen befallen, seien wiederum enger verwandt mit anderen tierischen Coronaviren, sodass es dort Überschneidungen geben könne. Das betrifft aber nicht die aktuell verwendeten PCR-Tests. (Mehr über Kreuzreaktionen lesen Siehier.)/n/nFazit:Drostens Aussagen über PCR-Tests von 2014 bezogen sich auf das Virus MERS-CoV, das sichwesentlich vom neuartigen Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 unterscheidet. Er kritisierte, dass sich Ärzte in Saudi-Arabien nicht an das damalige WHO-Testschema während der MERS-Epidemie hielten. Drosten schätzte die Gefahr einer weltweiten MERS-Pandemie damals als gering ein, und rückblickend lag er damit richtig./n/nRedigatur: Alice Echtermann, Uschi Jonas/n/nDie wichtigsten öffentlichen Quellen für diesen Faktencheck:/n/nIhre Spende gegen Fake News/n/nFalschmeldungen und Verschwörungsmythen spalten die Gesellschaft.

            "[Evidences]:Republicans criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for giving pens to other House members as keepsakes after she used them to sign the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Jan. 15. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, for example, retweeted a photo of the pens and wrote: \"Nancy Pelosi’s souvenir pens served up on silver platters to sign the sham articles of impeachment...She was so somber as she gave them away to people like prizes.\" But on Facebook, some users levied a new accusation against the speaker. \"$2,025 per pen,\" a Jan. 16 post begins. \"Paid for by taxpayers. Is there any doubt Pelosi thinks she’s the Queen? Now we know why she delayed sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate… she was waiting for her gold-plated impeachment pens.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim is wrong. Each pen cost just under $15, according to Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff. When we asked Richard Arenberg, a professor of the practice of political science at Brown University, about the post, he told us \"the $2,025 figure is ridiculous.\" Searching through all 16 pages of Google results for $2,025 and Pelosi’s name, we couldn’t find any other mentions of the pens’ price. The only relevant results were the message in this Facebook post reshared on web forums. The most recent Statement of Disbursements of the House, in which the chief administrative officer details receipts and expenditures of appropriations and other funds from July 1 to Sept. 30, 2019, shows that the speaker’s office spent about $29,000 on supplies and materials that quarter, and about $229,500 that year to date, but there isn’t a specific line item for pens. In the past, reporters have combed through these quarterly reports to see how lawmakers are spending taxpayer money. In 2009, Politico reported that Pelosi spent $2,993 on flowers between June and October of that year. Then-Minority Leader John Boehner spent about $24,617 on catering. According to Business Insider, Pelosi used 30 customized pens engraved with her name to sign her name on the impeachment articles. We would expect that Republicans outraged over the tone of the signing ceremony would also balk at the $60,750 price tag. But reviewing stories from the Washington Post, the Associated Press, Fox News, The Hill, BBC, and the Washington Times, among others, we saw no note of the pen’s price. It’s not unusual for lawmakers and presidents to gift signing pens though in this case Pelosi’s critics argue it wasn’t appropriate. As the BBC notes, then-President Barack Obama used 22 pens to sign the Affordable Care Act, and Republican senators kept pens as souvenirs after signing oaths for then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1998.

            "[Evidences]:Three images were shared here on Facebook on May 28 alongside a caption that translates as: \"A mother has given birth to seven children together in Hathazari, Chattogram. \"Thanks to the Almighty! The mother and children are all healthy, everyone please pray for the children.\" A similar Facebook post was shared more than 200 times here, while another user also shared the false claim here. However, a reverse search for the images on Google found that they were originally featured in the posts published here on May 26, on the Facebook account of Upazila Health Complex in Hathazari. The caption to the images shared by the hospital states in part: \"A caesarean section was completed successfully on May 25th, 2022. At the end of the operation, both the mother and the newborn are in good health.\" The hospital added that \"a total of six natural birth deliveries were completed at the Hathazari Upazila health complex from 6pm yesterday to 6am today.\" Responding to the false posts, Dr Surajit Dutta, a local health official at the hospital, told AFP: \"Seven different women gave birth to these children. \"As natural birth deliveries are rare nowadays, the birth of six babies without caesarean operation in 12 hours made headlines in some media.\" Below are screenshot comparisons of the images featured in one of the false posts (left) and the photos shared by the hospital (right): The Daily Jugantor, a Bangladesh-based newspaper, reported on the births here on May 26 and featured one of the photos shared in the posts. The online site of Bangladesh-based broadcaster News24 also reported on the seven babies being born to seven mothers here on the same day.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A screengrab of leading news channel CNBC Awaaz is being shared on social media. It quotes Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman claiming during her maiden budget that BJP government has distributed 35,000 crores LED bulbs in the country. A twitter handle @AlkaMaverick posted the screenshot with the message, “ये LED बल्ब किसको मिला है???? मुझे तो नहीं मिला..आपको??? (Who got this LED bulb? I didn’t get it, did you?)”. The comments of several users on Facebook and Twitter testify that many people believed the Finance Minister to have made the statement. Preeti Chobey, the national executive member of the Samajwadi Party, also tweeted the same screenshot and took a jibe at the ruling party. Fact-check Upon watching the complete July 5 budget speech of Nirmala Sitharaman, Alt News found that the figure cited by CNBC Awaz was incorrect. In her speech, the Finance Minister claimed that 35 crore (and not 35,000 crore) LED bulbs were distributed in the country. In the video posted below, Sitharaman can be heard saying at 1:06:48, “Approximately 35 crore LED bulbs have been distributed under UJALA Yojana, leading to cost saving of Rs 18,341 crores annually.” The same was cross-checked with the text of her speech available on Indiabuget.gov.in, the official website of the Union Budget under the GOI’s Finance Ministry. Alt News contacted a source within CNBC Awaaz who informed that “35,000” LED bulbs was a typo made during the broadcast and was corrected soon after it came to the organisation’s notice. In conclusion, a screengrab of CNBC Awaaz’s broadcast, where the news channel had mistakenly quoted the FM, was circulated on social media to question and target the BJP government.

            "claim [Claim]: \"Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:With his first \"state of the state\" address the night of Feb. 1, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker likely will tout some of his early legislative victories.Among them: Three tax breaks worth an estimated $140 million.But one of Walker’s political antagonists, Madison-based One Wisconsin Now, has slammed the three bills. In a Jan. 28, 2011, news release, the liberal advocacy group said:\"Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending.\"So, which is it? Tax cuts or spending?We know that state government folks are pretty crafty. But is it really possible for them to spend money they’ve decided not to tax in the first place?One Wisconsin Now’s statement cites three of the measures taken up by lawmakers since Walker called them into special session just hours after being inaugurated on Jan. 3, 2011.Here’s a look at each of the bills and their financial impact as estimated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s non-partisan research agency.Economic development tax creditSigned into law Jan. 31, 2011, this bill increases the state’s economic development tax credit fund to $98.1 million, up from $73.1 million. The fund provides a tax credit for job creation, capital investment or related activity. The additional $25 million in credits is not expected to be claimed during the 2011-2013 biennium.So, if employers create new jobs and claim the credits, they would pay less in taxes to the state. No spending would be involved.Health Savings Account deductionAlso signed into law, this measure allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Nearly every other state already allows this.The deductions will reduce state revenue by an estimated $20.7 million in 2011-2012 and $27.3 million in 2012-2013.Tax deduction for creating jobsUnder this bill, which is awaiting Walker’s signature, employers would receive a tax deduction for each job they create. They would pay an estimated $33.5 million less per year in income and franchise taxes. In other words, the bill doesn’t result in any spending, but the state would take in less tax money.See a pattern here?The bills in question don’t create any expenditures -- those are done in budget bills, which Walker has yet to introduce. But they do mean the state will take in less money.One Wisconsin Now says they apply to \"special interests.\" They may be targeted for specific purposes, but they also hit a wide range of people, including small business owners and any working person who has an HSA.We asked Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, how his organization could say the state would be spending $140 million when the effect of the three bills would be that the state would have $140 million less to spend.His reply: \"When money would otherwise be in the treasury which is no longer going to be there as a result of legislative action, that is the definition of spending.\"Actually, it’s just the Legislature making the treasury smaller. But we decided to ask the question again.Ross: \"If no action had been taken, this money would have been in the treasury. It will now no longer be in the treasury. We feel that is a form of spending.\"Hmmm.Ross is no dummy. He has a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.A. from George Washington University, according to a political bio. He’s worked for a number of Democratic politicos, including Wisconsin congressman Ron Kind. He even worked as a journalist.And Ross isn’t alone with his spending notion.David Riemer, who was budget director under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, said the concept of a \"tax expenditure\" dates back some 50 years to Stanley Surrey, an assistant U.S. treasury secretary. The idea, Riemer said, is that tax breaks with a particular purpose that could be accomplished by direct spending should be considered expenditures.\"Their way of viewing this,\" Riemer said of One Wisconsin Now, \"is a legitimate, honestly grounded approach. But there’s also legitimate arguments on the other side.\"OK, let’s go to the other side.George Lightbourn, who was secretary of administration under two Republican Wisconsin governors, said that what One Wisconsin Now is claiming is \"ridiculous\" -- \"there’s nothing being spent, there’s not an appropriation being made.\"\"From a political standpoint, I could see where you’d make that argument,\" Lightbourn said, referring to One Wisconsin Now. \"But it wouldn’t hold water with the accountants.\"Or with the average taxpayer.We decided to try Ross a third time. This time, he tried to make his case by pointing out that Walker had described the federal stimulus bill as spending, even though the bill included tax cuts.Tax cuts and credits did make up about one-third of the $862 billion stimulus-- but two-thirds was spending.Three strikes is enough.One Wisconsin Now called $140 million in state tax breaks \"spending.\" It’s estimated that the three bills in question would bring in $140 million less to state coffers. But that’s not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have.We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Update: The day this PolitiFact item, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross modified the way he described the three tax break bills. Rather than calling them spending, he said in a news release issued by the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin that the bills are \"deficit-hiking corporate giveaways.\"\n",

            "[Evidences]:A little self-care can go a long way — and for one man, some alone time turned into a prolonged and painful experience. The 20-year-old found himself in an emergency room with severe dyspnea, or shortness of breath, and chest pain that he experienced while lying in bed masturbating. It sounds like the stuff of digital urban legends, but this really happened. We were turned on to the claim when we came across an article published by the pop-science website IFLScience. And we found that the unfortunate episode was described in a case report, a scientific recounting of an event and not an evaluated study, and was published in the May 2022 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Radiology Case Reports. “We present a case of a young man who was admitted to our emergency department with spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) and profound subcutaneous emphysema (SCE) after an autoerotic experience,” wrote the treating physicians of Winterthur Hospital in Switzerland. SPM is a rare condition that typically affects young men in their 20s and accounts for less than .0009% of emergency department admissions. It can be triggered by several physiological causes, including asthma exacerbation, strenuous exercise, excessive vomiting, or violent coughing. High pulmonary pressure in the thoracic area leads to a rupture of the alveolar membrane, which includes the small air cells in the lungs. This rupture causes air to leak along pulmonary vessels and into surrounding tissue. Dubbed the “Macklin effect,” this pressure is eventually forced to leave the mediastinal cavity, an area that holds the heart and lungs, to travel along deep fascia tissuesin the cervical spine (neck area) and into the surrounding tissues, causing SCE. About 70% of all SPM cases will also have SCE. Symptoms typically include chest pain, shortness of breath, neck pain, and a crackling sound made when breathing known as crepitations. But this “unusual presentation” is the first known report to the authors. The patient had a history of mild asthma and ADHD but did not otherwise have noticeable health concerns that may have heightened his risk for SPM. When he arrived at the hospital, the man had a swollen face and crackling crepitations. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest and neck showed “profound” SPM and subcutaneous emphysema, which is when air becomes trapped in the tissues beneath the skin that reach up from the base of the skull. Over three days, the man was treated for chest pain and given antibiotics before ultimately being dismissed. “There are only a few reports of SPM related to sexual activity and we could not find any cases associated with autoeroticism, which makes our case unusual,” wrote the treating doctors. Those few reports included the case report of a “cannabis smoker” who engaged in “vigorous sexual intercourse,” a 21-year-old Illinois man who ingested ecstasy before having sex, and another 21-year-old male who “became gradually breathless” during sexual intercourse.

Marco Rubio won reelection.The speed with which the state’s highest-profile Republican officeholders could claim victory left some social media users questioning why smaller states needed several days to count votes.\"So FL with 14.4 million registered voters was able to count ALL their votes within 2 hrs after being hit by a devastating hurricane,\" reads a Nov. 12 Instagram post. \"But it takes NV 4 days to count 900K votes? And it 'all of a sudden' flips to Democrat on the last day and it's immediately called?\"The post, which references the challenges Florida was still facing more than five weeks after Hurricane Ian struck, had more than 200 likes. The Instagram post was a screenshot of a tweet, and other variations circulated on Instagram as well.The post, however, misstates what happened in Florida and Nevada, confusing vote counting and official results issued by states with calls made by the media.News outlets did make calls about some races in Florida on the night of the election because, based on the unofficial results, the outcomes were decisive and relatively easy to determine. Calls about Nevada races were made later – largely because the results were close in many races and the media could not identify the winners with certainty for several days.At the same time, Florida did not count all votes within two hours of polls closing, nor did Nevada's vote totals suddenly flip after four days of counting. Florida's election results only became official two weeks after the election, and it began counting early mail-in ballots back in October. Nevada's heavy use of mail-in ballots and the tendency of younger, typically left-leaning voters to return those later explains why vote tallies there shifted toward Democrats over several days of counting, experts say.USA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the claim for comment.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksFlorida’s midterm election results were certified on Nov. 22, two weeks after Election Day. Ballot counting began before Election Day and likely continued in some form up until certification day, according to experts.Ballot counting has never been completed on Election Day in any state at any point in the nation’s history, David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, previously told USA TODAY. Most of the results reported on election night are from that day's in-person voting and early in-person voting, along with any preprocessed mail-in ballots in states that allow that to happen.Florida was able to present much of its final vote totals within hours of polls closing in part because it counts mail-in ballots early, according to Phil Keisling, chair of the National Vote at Home Institute. State law allows it to begin verifying absentee voter identities and scanning ballots after tabulation equipment is publicly tested, meaning election officials could start scanning ballots in October.Having a large window for those time-consuming processes is important because in-person votes “go to the front of the line” for counting, Keisling said. Florida has not released a breakdown of how many votes were counted before Election Day, but the state says 2.7 million mail-in ballots were received.Keisling said typical ballot return patterns make it likely much of that vote was counted early. Florida is one of only 10 states that counts mail-in votes early, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Vote counting also extends beyond election night to provide time to address special circumstances spelled out in state and federal laws. Overseas military ballots are allowed to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day and arrive before certification deadlines, Keisling said. All states also allow time to determine the validity of provisional ballots cast when there were questions about a voter's proper polling place or registration. And states also allow time for voters to prove they cast an absentee ballot if the signature on the envelope doesn't match the voter's signature on file, a process known as curing.Any declarations of winners before certification come from media or candidates, not election officials, Keisling noted. Florida’s races for senator and governor were won by margins north of 17%, making it easier to call on election night than Nevada's races, which were decided by 0.8% and 1.5%, respectively.Keisling said there was nothing suspicious about Nevada's vote count taking longer or the way tallies moved towards Democrats as the counting advanced.This year, Nevada began sending all registered voters mail-in ballots unless they opted out. The new system allowed for votes postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they were received by Nov. 12.In the end, according to Nevada's official election results, 51% of the 1.02 million votes cast in the 2022 November election were mail-in ballots.Before Election Day, Nevada election officials warned that it would take days to process ballots.The extended window for receiving ballots after Election Day alone meant media would not be able to declare winners in Nevada races for days unless they were largely blowouts, said Michael McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida.The in-person vote in most states historically skews Republican, creating relatively large GOP leads in early vote counting, McDonald said. This tendency only increased as former President Donald Trump repeatedly urged Republicans not to use mail-in ballots.Nevada, like Florida, allows for processing and counting early mail-in ballots. And the difference in when ballots are returned means mail ballots from younger voters, who lean Democratic, tend to be counted later.Those trends explain why the apparent lead for Republican challenger Adam Laxalt faded as more votes were counted in the Nevada Senate race, with incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez claiming victory on Nov. 12. Nevertheless, the same trend was not enough for incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to hold off Republican challenger Joe Lombardo, because the gap after election night was too large.Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Florida counted all votes within two hours of polls closing, while Nevada's results flipped suddenly after days of counting. Florida spent weeks counting ballots, but news outlets called winners in some Florida races on election night after getting unofficial results that showed insurmountable leads. Nevada also released unofficial results, but these were issued more slowly and were not decisive enough early on for the media to project winners in high-profile races. Nevada's results did not flip suddenly, demographics that lean democratic were just more heavily represented in the mail-in ballots that were counted later.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

Numerous states have been offering a range of free items or prizes in the hopes of getting more Americans to sign up for the COVID-19 shot. Now West Virginia has joined the trend. The state government announced a lottery for Father’s Day, which falls on June 20, 2021, with numerous prizes offered including shotguns and rifles, and only people who are vaccinated at least once will qualify. Gov. Jim Justice announced the initiative on June 1. The government will be giving away two brand-new trucks, two scholarships for students from the ages of 12 to 25, a number of weekend getaways to state parks, five lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, and even $1 million to a lucky winner. But that’s not all. “We are gonna give 5 custom hunting rifles, and 5 custom hunting shotguns away, on Father’s Day,” Justice said. Gov. Justice and state officials provide an update on West Virginia’s COVID-19 response efforts – June 1, 2021.

Those who received both their vaccine doses are also eligible. Registrations for the giveaway will begin on Friday, June 4, according to a news release. The release also said that the initiative will be called “Do it for Babydog: Save a life. Change your life.” Baby Dog is the name of Justice’s pet English bulldog. Only 34 percent of the population of West Virginia, according to NPR’s Vaccine Tracker, is fully vaccinated, and in April the demand for vaccines was dipping. The state had announced an initiative to offer a $100 saving bond to everyone between the ages of 16 and 35 who got vaccinated. We should also note that West Virginia has the 13th-highest rate of gun deaths in the United States. Given that this has been announced by the governor, we rate this claim as “True.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:Experts say it's incorrect to describe unreturned ballots as missing; it represents those who refrained from voting. They are known as un-cast ballot. J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department attorney, claimed that unaccounted-for ballots represent 28 million opportunities for someone to cheat, and millions more end up missing. He referred to the ballots that were mailed to voters and then ultimately ended up in a category that the federal government calls 'unknown.' According to data from the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the 28 million figure primarily represents uncast ballots and is not indicative of widespread voter fraud. Between 2012 and 2018, 28.3 million mail-in ballots remain unaccounted. The missing ballots amount to nearly one in five of all absentee ballots and ballots mailed to voters living in states that do elections only by mail. Federal data shows that in 2016 about 1% of absentee ballots were rejected, most commonly for missing or mismatched signatures, or for arriving after the deadline. States and local authorities did not understand what happened to these ballots since they were mailed, and the figure of 28 million missing ballots is likely even higher because some areas in the country, notably Chicago, did not respond. This figure does not include ballots that were spoiled, undeliverable, or came back for any reason. But EAC stated that those 28 million missing ballots were that neither returned undeliverable nor returned from voter ballots mailed out in multiple states over four elections that were not marked and sent back. Although there is no evidence that the millions of missing ballots that used fraudulently, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which compiled the public data provided from the Election help Commission, says that the sheer volume of them raises serious doubts about election security. The federal surveys reflect 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 General Elections. Experts studying voting data from Election Administration and Voting Survey, produced by the Federal Election Assistance Commission, said it is wrong to call these ballots missing as they represent voters who ultimately did not cast a vote.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share As former president Donald Trump held rallies across the country in advance of the midterm elections, a central part of his speech was a dramatic proposal to begin executing drug dealers quickly, with little recourse for defendants to due process rules that might prevent swift prosecution and sentencing. Trump presents his idea with a blizzard of statistics and figures — and a gruesome anecdote — to justify what would be an extraordinary and legally shaky change in criminal justice policy. As is often the case with Trump, the claims he makes as part of this riff are easily debunked or cannot be verified. And, as he often does, Trump speaks in admiring terms about an authoritarian regime as he offers China as a role model — although with an inaccurate depiction of its practices and history. Yet Trump’s plan to execute drug dealers is one of the few substantive policy proposals he makes in speeches that delve deeply into grievances about his defeat in the 2020 election. As president, Trump sometimes complained that sentences were not tough enough for drug dealers. Now he appears to have developed a solution. Advertisement So it should be taken seriously, especially because it might feature prominently if, as expected, he announces a third run for the presidency. Here’s a line-by-line dissection of specific claims Trump made at an Ohio rally Nov. 7 for Senate candidate J.D. Vance as he detailed his proposal to the cheers of the audience. A Trump spokesman did not respond to a query concerning the sourcing for Trump’s statistics and other claims. “Biden and the radical Democrats do nothing to stop the lethal poisons pouring across our borders. And we had it almost stopped.” As president, Trump often touted how much seizures of drugs at the southern border had increased on his watch. (Most drugs are smuggled through legal ports of entry.) This is an imperfect metric. It could mean that law enforcement is doing a better job. But more seizures also might indicate that the drug flow has increased, and that law enforcement is missing even more. Advertisement In any case, the flow of drugs over the border was not “almost stopped” under Trump. Under Biden, according to Customs and Border Protection statistics, overall drug seizures have dropped, especially for marijuana, but have increased substantially for fentanyl — the drug most responsible for overdose deaths. Both the decrease in marijuana seizures and the increase in fentanyl seizures reflect trends that started under Trump. A few moments later, Trump made a similar if slightly different claim — “the drugs are seven times to 10 times higher than when we had it only two years ago.” There are no government figures that verify that statement. “Since the end of the Trump administration, the drug cartels have seen their revenue skyrocket by an astounding — listen to this one, you businesspeople, you think you’re good at business, you’re nothing compared to these people — 2,500 percent.” Advertisement The illicit drug business can be extraordinarily profitable, especially when making synthetic opioids. Fentanyl-type products have an inexpensive and easy-to-make formula. But Trump offers a suspiciously precise statistic — 2,500 percent — for an industry that does not publish revenue figures and whose financials can only be roughly estimated. Moreover, price increases often happen at the retail level — north of the border — and do not return to the drug cartels in Mexico. A Rand study released in May estimated that the median price for illegally manufactured fentanyl has declined more than 50 percent from 2016 to 2021. Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center, said, “We have no idea how many people are using illegally manufactured fentanyl and heroin in the U.S., let alone how many people are selling these products.” He said the most recent study on spending on illicit drugs was completed in 2016 — and it showed spending in the United States for cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine was about $150 billion that year. That was little changed from 2006. But that study did not cover fentanyl, as there is not good data on fentanyl consumption. Advertisement “Much of the crime wave is caused by drug dealers who, during the course of their lives, will kill an average of 500 Americans. Think of that. A drug dealer. You see, a drug dealer will kill on average 500 people.” Trump offers another precise statistic, again very dubious. As Kilmer noted, the number of drug dealers is unknown, making it impossible to estimate how many people die per drug dealer. But on a practical level, his figure makes little sense. About 600,000 people died of drug overdoses from 2010 to 2020, according to the National Institutes of Health. Doing the math, Trump’s statistic would suggest that there are only 1,200 drug dealers in the United States. But the federal government prosecutes nearly 20,000 drug traffickers a year. Still, for Trump, this figure is a rare pullback. As president, he would routinely say drug dealers would kill thousands of people, such as in 2018: “A drug dealer will kill 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people, during the course of his or her life.” Advertisement At the time, when we investigated this statistic, White House officials suggested that Trump was not talking about ordinary dealers but drug kingpins. They pointed to a drug trafficking conspiracy in Knoxville, Tenn., to distribute oxycodone, oxymorphone and morphine through pain management clinics. Some 12 million opioid pills were prescribed by the group, leading to as many as 700 deaths, prosecutors said. As president, Trump often claimed that drug dealers would just get 30 days in jail. One of the alleged ringleaders in the Knoxville case, a 56-year-old grandmother, in 2020 was sentenced to more than 33 years in jail. Whether the death penalty could be applied to drug dealers is unclear. The Supreme Court, in a 2008 ruling, said “the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken.” But the majority opinion did not completely close the door: “We do not address, for example, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the state,” not against individuals. Advertisement “I am calling for the death penalty for drug dealers and human traffickers, which will, upon its passage, reduce drug distribution and reduce crime in our country by a minimum of 75 percent.” The death penalty has not been shown to be effective in reducing crime or murder rates in the United States, according to research — in part because it is applied so rarely that researchers cannot easily measure the impact. Trump’s estimate of a 75 percent reduction appears to have been conjured out of thin air. “With President Xi in China, I see him and say, ‘President, you have 1.5 billion people. Do you have a drug problem?’ ‘No, no, no drug problem.’ ” There is no way of knowing whether Xi Jinping said this to Trump, but Trump several times recounted a similar conversation during his presidency. But if Xi ever said this to Trump, he was spinning him. Advertisement News reports indicate that China has a significant drug-trafficking problem. “In March [2017], the China National Narcotics Control Commission told media that China’s seizure of synthetic drugs including methamphetamine and ketamine has ‘surged by 106 percent year on year in 2016,’ ” the BBC reported. The official Xinhua News Agency said in 2018 that a part of Guangdong province is “plagued with rampant drug production and trafficking,” the BBC reported. The number of drug addicts officially registered with the Chinese government rose to about 2.5 million in 2013 from just under a million in 2001, according to a 2016 Brookings Institution report titled, “A People’s War: China’s Struggle to Contain its Illicit Drug Problem.” A 2022 Chinese government report said the number of drug users had dropped to 1.5 million in 2021, which the report credited to a concerted anti-drug campaign. The report also said that prosecutors uncovered 41,000 drug smuggling, trafficking, and transportation cases and arrested 60,000 traffickers. Advertisement China was a significant source of fentanyl in the United States until, under pressure from the Trump administration, it imposed new controls on all forms of fentanyl. According to the State Department, these controls resulted in the detection of no shipments of fentanyl from China since September 2019. But the State Department says traffickers simply switched tactics, and as a result of “ineffective oversight,” China remains a major source of precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl in Mexico for shipment to the United States. “Xi goes, ‘We have a quick trial.’ … That means they catch a drug dealer, they give them a quick trial, not a trial that takes 12 years and 12 years of appeals. Twenty-five years later, and everyone’s dead by the time they get to the end of that. Now, this is a trial that takes approximately two hours. And if they’re guilty, they are executed.” Trump is in the ballpark here. But it is wrong to suggest that all drug dealers in China receive the death sentence and that all are quickly executed. China is known to have a high number of executions — potentially thousands a year, according to Amnesty International — for several offenses, including nonviolent crimes such as bribery and running a sex-work ring. Appeals are limited. But China does not disclose the annual figure of those killed because the use of the death penalty is classified as a state secret. Harm Reduction International, in a 2022 report, said it could confirm at least one execution for drug offenses in China in 2021 — that of a woman. The Sun newspaper in 2018 quoted local media as reporting that two Chinese drug dealers were sentenced to death in front of thousands of people, including 300 schoolchildren, as part of international anti-drug day. They were immediately taken to an execution ground and killed. Seventeen other drug dealers were also put on trial in front of the crowd, with eight being given death sentences or death sentences with suspension, according to the report. “The bullet. I don’t know if anybody wants to know this. It gets a little bit too graphic, but the bullet is sent to their families, you know that, right? You know that it’s actually sent to their families. It’s pretty tough stuff. There’s no games. So they have no drug problem whatsoever.” There is limited evidence to support Trump’s anecdote, but it appears out of date. The Chinese government today carries out most executions with lethal injection. So there would be no bullet to deliver. “The move to lethal injection also facilitates the use of the organs of executed prisoners, in circumstances where their meaningful consent is impossible,” said Kevin Darling, a spokesman for Amnesty International. “Claims that family members were presented with the bullet date back to Cultural Revolution times, so they could be considered historical, but it is not something Amnesty has documented — especially not in recent decades.” The Cultural Revolution took place between 1966 and 1976. Nicola Macbean, the director of the Rights Practice in London and an expert on human rights in China, also said that with the advent of lethal injections, such a practice probably is not in current use and it probably was never an official policy. “I have heard of bullets being sent to the family following execution, but I suspect this is no longer the practice and it’s unclear if it was widespread,” she said. She noted that The Washington Post, in a 1994 report, said that in some cases a prisoner’s family was billed for the bullet — the equivalent of about 6 cents — or else the executed person’s ashes would not be returned to the family.

            "[Evidences]:A Facebook user has posted a video which suggests that the Moderna vaccine is dangerous to human health because one of its ingredients appears to be described as hazardous and toxic in a safety data sheet. But this warning applies to the ingredient (a lipid called SM-102) when it is in a mixture with chloroform, a known highly toxic substance. The video shows someone Google \"simple ingredients for the moderna vaccine\". They then scroll through the results, and find that an ingredient \"SM-102\" is first in a bullet point list. Searching for SM-102 leads to a chemical supplier's website . The user downloads the safety data sheet provided and highlights a number of hazards associated with the substance. These include warnings that it is \"highly flammable\", \"suspected of causing cancer\", \"suspected of damaging fertility\" and causes \"damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver, the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure\" amongst others. Although the Moderna vaccine does contain SM-102, and the Facebook video does follow a link to a genuine safety data sheet, the safety information refers to SM-102 in a mixture with chloroform, which is known to be a toxic substance . The third page of the leaflet shown in the video, explains the product listing, stating that chloroform (which makes up 90% of this particular mixture) is a \"dangerous\" component. The SM-102 makes up 10% of the mixture described in the leaflet. Similar claims have also been fact checked by PolitiFact . Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What is SM-102 and does the Moderna vaccine use it? The Moderna vaccine's active ingredient is a piece of genetic material called mRNA which is essentially the instruction to make the spike proteins found on the surface of the virus that causes Covid-19. Once these are made, this then triggers an immune response to those proteins, which protects the body against the real virus. SM-102 is a lipid molecule used to form the nanoparticle which carries the mRNA in the Moderna vaccine to cells in the body. The Pfizer vaccine uses different lipid molecules for this purpose. Although SM-102 is used in the Moderna vaccine , the vaccine does not contain chloroform and it is not listed in the vaccine's ingredients . Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine was given regulatory approval for use in the UK in January 2021. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said \"all COVID-19 vaccines are continually monitored by the MHRA. This ensures that the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 continue to far outweigh any potential side-effects.\" The MHRA told Full Fact \"The manufacture for the SM-102 is controlled and agreed specifications have to be met before it can be used in the lipid nanoparticles for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\" The MHRA also added: \"We are not aware of any reason for specific concerns with the safety of SM-102. \"Chloroform is not used in the manufacture of SM-102 for this vaccine.\"\n",

            "[Evidences]:On the evening of Sept. 18, 2020, three men sitting on the patio outside of Bungalow Joe’s, a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky,were shot and killed. As police worked to apprehend and charge the murder suspect, a 33-year-old man named Michael Rhynes Jr., social media users went to work inventing a motive for the killings. A video supposedly showing Rhynes’ arrest was posted to TikTok, and was used as “evidence” by those claiming that the murder suspect was wearing a “Justice for Breonna Taylor” shirt during the incident. This false claim was later shared in an article by conspiratorial website The Gateway Pundit, which also falsely claimed that this violent incident took place in a retired police officer’s bar. The Gateway Pundit wrote: Black Lives Matter Activist Wearing ‘Justice for Breonna Taylor’ Shirt Walked into a Louisville Bar and Murdered Three People A black male walked into a Louisville bar owned by a retired police officer and shot three random people at point blank range on Friday night — while wearing a Justice for Breonna Taylor shirt. The suspect was smiling from ear to ear as he was arrested for the shooting at Bungalow Joe’s Bar and Grill. The facts are these: Three men — Steven Matthew Head, 24, Toreon Jermaine Hudson, 26, and William Scott Smallwood, 48 — were shot and killed outside of Bungalow Joe’s on Sept. 18, 2020. Police officers in Louisville arrested Rhynes shortly afterward, and have charged him with three counts of murder. As of this writing, police have not released a motive for the killing. Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Donny Burbrink, the leader of the department’s homicide unit, said: “We’re exploring all options at this point, and I don’t think that we want to pigeonhole ourselves and say that this is a hate crime or that this is racially motivated […] We don’t have any evidence to say that at this point, and I don’t want to fuel that fire by saying something that we do not have definitive proof that actually happened.” Police have, however, disputed some of the attempts on social media to politicize this horrendous incident. For example, the shooter was not wearing a “Justice for Breonna Taylor” shirt, a reference to the unarmed 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police officers in her Louisville home in March 2020. According to police, Rhynes was actually wearing a shirt featuring an image of NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, boxer Muhammad Ali, and the word “Freedom.” Here’s a still from the TikTok video supposedly showing Rhynes’ arrest (left), and an image that appears to show the shirt police officers said that he was wearing: The owner of Bungalow Joe’s, Joe Bishop, has also disputed some of these rumors. Bishop told the local news outlet Wave 3 that he isn’t a retired police officer, that his establishment is a family restaurant, not a bar, and that these killings took place outside — not inside — the restaurant. Bishop said: “I’m not an ex-cop, the killings were not done in my restaurant they were done out here, outside, I’m a family restaurant, not a bar.” Bishop described the murders as a “completely random act” during a news interview, and said that “there was nothing political about what happened.” He added that one of the victims was a Black man. Bishop has also set up a GoFundMe for the families of the victims that has exceeded its monetary goal. Rumors on social media attempted to paint the suspect as a Black Lives Matter activist purposefully targeting and killing police officers. However, that rumor does not hold up to scrutiny. We have no direct evidence that the suspected shooter was a supporter of BLM or active in that movement. More importantly, there’s no evidence that these killings were driven by political motivations. This incident did not take place at a retired police officer’s bar and we found no mention of the victims being connected to law enforcement. As of this writing, the owner of the restaurant, as he described in the GoFundMe page, believes that these killings was perpetrated by a “lone, deranged gunman” who “indiscriminately shot and killed 3 customers of a Family Restaurant in Louisville Ky, Bungalow Joes.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:CLAIM “In 1950, there were around 10,000 polar bears globally. Today, polar bear populations are near 39,000. Polar bear populations are increasing dramatically as the planet has warmed.” more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Andy Singer, Climate Realism, Heartland Institute, 23 Oct. 2020 DETAILS Factually inaccurate: The current global polar bear population is estimated to be 20,000 to 26,000 bears distributed among 19 subpopulations, not 39,000 as claimed. Fails to grasp significance of observation: Polar bears were heavily harvested in the 1950s and 1960s. An increase in polar bear population size since the 1950s does not demonstrate that polar bears are not affected by climate change, but rather that an agreement was signed in 1973 stating that harvesting should be done at sustainable levels. Inadequate support: There is no scientific evidence provided to support the claims made in the video or the figure showing increases in the global polar bear population size over time. KEY TAKE AWAY Loss of sea ice habitat caused by climate change is the most important threat to the long term survival of polar bears. Of the 19 subpopulations of polar bears, two have already experienced declines due to losses in sea ice. It is difficult to estimate trends in the global polar bear population; however, trends at the subpopulation level from 2019 show that four subpopulations declined, five were stable, and only two increased. REVIEW CLAIM: “In 1950, there were around 10,000 polar bears globally. Today, polar bear populations are near 39,000. That alone pokes a hole in the whole plight of the polar bears story. Polar bear populations are increasing dramatically as the planet has warmed.” REVIEW The claims appeared in a Facebook video published in October 2020 by “Climate Realism”, a project run by the Heartland Institute, which has a history of publishing climate information inconsistent with findings from the scientific community. The video suggests that global warming is not a threat to polar bears because the global polar bear population increased in size since 1950. Contrary to this claim, scientific evidence demonstrates that sea ice loss induced by climate change is currently the greatest threat to the long-term survival of polar bears[1-3]. Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt seals (their primary prey), mate, establish dens, and move to new regions seasonally[2]. Loss of sea ice is occurring in almost all polar bear subpopulations. Scientists can evaluate the effects of climate change on polar bears by correlating local losses in sea ice habitat with polar bear subpopulation size. Several studies using this approach found that loss of sea ice has already negatively affected some subpopulations, including Western Hudson Bay and Southern Beaufort Sea (see figure below)[4,5]. Figure—Estimated size of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation using data from capture-recapture models from 1984-2011. From Lunn et al. 2016[5]. In addition to declines in population size, loss of sea ice also affects polar bear body condition and survival rates. “Long-term monitoring studies in Canada suggest that polar bear body condition, survival and population growth rates are all negatively impacted by declines in the availability of sea ice habitat and there are no data to suggest that polar bears are thriving in areas where sea ice has significantly declined,” said Gabrielle Lamontagne, a communication advisor for Environment and Climate Change Canada. The trend of the global polar bear population is unknown, according to the IUCN Red List[6], however trends can be observed at the subpopulation scale. The current global polar bear population is estimated to be 20,000 to 26,000 bears, which are distributed among 19 subpopulations[6,7]. Of the 19 subpopulations measured by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group, only two increased, four declined, and five were stable in 2019. The other subpopulations did not have enough data to demonstrate short or long-term trends (see figure below). Figure—Geographic distribution, size, and trends of 19 polar bear subpopulations measured by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group. Colors reflect subpopulation trends in 2019. Shape and size represent subpopulation size, measured in the number of bears. Adapted from the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group. These data directly contradict the video’s estimate that the global polar bear population is 39,000 bears. Although there is no scientific source cited in the video, the inaccurate number was most likely drawn from a blog published by Susan Crockford in March 2019. As stated in Harvey et al. (2018), “as of this writing, Crockford has neither conducted any original research nor published any articles in the peer-reviewed literature on the effects of sea ice on the population dynamics of polar bears.”[8] While the global polar bear population may have increased from 1950 to today, data on polar bear populations was limited or non-existent prior to the late 1970s, as described by the reviewers below. During this time, hunting, killing, and capturing polar bears were the biggest threats to their survival. In 1973, the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears was signed to address these practices[7]. Specifically, Article II of the agreement states, “Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate action to protect the ecosystems of which polar bears are a part, with special attention to habitat components such as denning and feeding sites and migration patterns, and shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data.” This agreement likely led to an increase in the global polar bear population in the 1970s[9]. But as stated in Hunter et al. (2015), “there is no evidence that these increases continued, and such recoveries, where they occurred, are irrelevant to the effects of recent changes in the availability of sea ice”[9]. Overall, the claims made in the video are not consistent with scientific evidence demonstrating that loss of sea ice habitat due to climate change is the biggest threat to the long-term survival of polar bears[10]. Some subpopulations of polar bears have already declined due to losses in sea ice. The claim that the global polar bear population is 39,000 bears is unsupported and inconsistent with current evidence. SCIENTISTS’ FEEDBACK Andrew Derocher, Professor, University of Alberta: [comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim] There are 19 subpopulations of polar bears across the Arctic. Four are likely decreasing (according to the IUCN/SSC Polar Bear Specialist Group – of which I am a member). Five are likely stable and two are likely increasing. The remainder are unknown. If one considers the “global” population as if there is 1 population in the Arctic, the claim of “growing” cannot be supported. While we have zero data on polar bear abundance until the late 1970s, polar bears were commercially harvested until ca. 1973 when the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears was signed that introduced harvest controls. Polar bears, while based on poor or no data, were heavily depleted in the 1950s-1960s. So, from 1970 to 2020, polar bear populations overall increased. This of course ignores areas that have now declined (Western Hudson Bay, Southern Hudson Bay, Southern Beaufort Sea) and M’Clintock Channel that was severely overharvested post-1973. It’s a word game. Past increases were due to harvest controls. Current declines are due to climate change associated loss of sea ice[1,2,3]. Ian Stirling, Adjunct Professor, University of Alberta: First, and most importantly, there never was a factual basis for the “estimate” in 1950 as no population studies of polar bears had been done anywhere in the Arctic at that time. The number was a genuine “guestimate”, i.e., simply a guess based on what little was known before there had been any population surveys or research on the relationship between the polar bears and seals. Another important additional ecological aspect was that in 1950, no one realized how enormous the populations of ringed and bearded seals were around the circumpolar Arctic or, consequently, what their potential might be for supporting much larger populations of polar bears than were normally seen not too far offshore where some humans traveled regularly. As serious quantitative population-level surveys began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in response to the heavy overharvesting that had taken place in several populations, mainly through the 1960s and into the early 70s. Much of this new research was facilitated by increased research budgets and the development of more effective and safer immobilization drugs which, together, made the first quantitative studies of a few populations possible. So, although no one has any factual idea about the size of the circumpolar population of polar bears in 1950, it seems pretty clear that the total guestimate of 10,000 was likely low, even in the face of heavy overharvest of some populations. However, given that there were simply no quantitative data with which to estimate population size in 1950, the only accurate statement that can be made is that we simply don’t know. [the following comment is from a previous evaluation of a similar claim] As for real numerical information on polar bears, if anyone wants to know how much can be said with as much reliability as is possible, they should go to the web site for the IUCN Polar Bear Specialists Group (which I am also a member of). Note on the left hand side there are headings that give estimates and summaries (with references) of knowledge for all the 19 populations. The estimates for some populations are labelled as current, outdated, and nonexistent for others, particularly in Russia, so it is not technically possible to have a “total estimate”. In reality, it is the status and trends of the 19 individual populations that count. Several populations, such as those in western and southern Hudson Bay, and the southern Beaufort Sea are confirmed unequivocally, from long-term data, to have declined significantly as a direct result of climate warming causing steady loss of sea ice[4,5]. Some other populations are likely also declining, just judging from the extent of the steady loss of ice but we lack long-term data with which to make that assessment, and a couple are doing OK, such as Foxe Basin and Davis Straight, and one seems to be increasing (M’Clintock Channel). However, unless we are able to stop global warming and maybe even start to cool the planet, all populations will decline severely and some will be lost forever[9,10]. The steady loss of sea ice in all subpopulation regions is well summarized by Stern and Laidre[2]. Dr. Derocher and I also published a review a few years ago that gives the state of knowledge about the effects of climate warming on polar bears[1]. REFERENCES: UPDATES:\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says that under a new program jail \"time for non-violent, mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Karen Sage of Austin, facing a Tuesday runoff with Mindy Montford of Austin for the Democratic nod for a judgeship, touts her experience as a prosecutor overseeing a new unit focused on defendants with mental illness. With no Republican opponent in November, the winner of the runoff will likely be a shoo-in for Travis County’s 299th state District Court judgeship. In a mailer sent to voters April 3, Sage celebrates the new program, saying that jail “time for non-violent, mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent.”We wondered if Sage’s statement—echoed in a TV ad she debuted Wednesday—reflects reality. Sage’s campaign initially referred us to Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney. Lehmberg confirmed that she asked Sage, an assistant district attorney, to helm the felony mental health unit, which was started in January 2009. Claire Dawson-Brown, the DA’s director of strategic prosecutions, said a magistrate started handling a special docket comprised of “mental health” defendants in late April 2009. To be in the program, Dawson-Brown said, defendants must usually be charged with a non-violent crime. They also must be diagnosed with major depression or considered bipolar, schizo-affective or schizophrenic, and seen as unstable in the jail. “It would be someone in a crisis situation,” she said, “or their mental illness is impairing their behavior.” Experts team to address the needs of the mental health inmates, Dawson-Brown said. She said participants get services they need in custody and when they return to the community. Besides Sage, who has a paralegal and a secretary, each defendant has an attorney familiar with mental health issues; she said the magistrate, a jail counselor and officials serving the local mental health and adult probation systems also play roles, with social workers sometimes getting involved. And how has the program affected jail stays? Sage said she reached her 50-percent reduction statement by comparing a baseline estimate that “mental health” inmates facing felony charges were averaging 106 days in jail before the program began to the 42-day average for participants in the program at the time she left the office in mid-December to run for judge. The decrease amounts to 60 percent. Dawson-Brown agreed that as of late 2008 and early 2009, the average Travis County jail stay for all its “mental health” defendants, including violent offenders, was 106 days. We pointed out that the baseline figure sweeps in the longer jail stays of individuals charged with violent crimes who aren’t automatically put in the new program, driving up the pre-program average and potentially skewing before and after comparisons. Dawson-Brown then gave us more detailed jail-stay information enabling an improved review of the change in average jail stays. Based on the new figures, we estimate that defendants who have been through the new program would have averaged 77 days in jail before the program began. The nitty gritty: We multiplied the number of affected defendants categorized by the level of felony they faced--ranging from first-degree felony charges to second- and third-degree felonies to state-jail felony charges--by the days that similarly charged defendants averaged in jail before the program began. Next, we totaled those defendant-days-in-jail and divided the total (19,432) by the number of defendants (253) to reach the pre-program estimate of an average of 77 days in jail. Through February, the magistrate had processed 253 defendants since the program’s start, according to Dawson-Brown, and they averaged 36 days in jail. Best we can tell, the average jail stay for defendants dropped by 41 days, or 53 percent. We rate Sage’s statement as True.\n",

No, that's not true: Israel got rid of Green and Purple Badges program because the number of COVID-19 infections decreased in their country. The story originated from a Facebook post (archived here) where it was published on June 9, 2021, with the caption \"🔥 Is this true??? If so then the government is shooting its self in the foot ONCE AGAIN 🤦🏽‍♂️😅\". It opened: In Israel earlier this year, authorities abandoned vaccine passports. One of the main reasons was that so many people refused the jab, had no \"passport\" didn't go shopping or attend events and spent less money, that the economy suffered. This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Fri Jun 11 17:01:49 2021 UTC) On May 23, 2021, Israel's Ministry of Health released a statement about lifting all COVID-19 restrictions. The health minister, Yuli (Yoel) Edelstein said, \"Israel returns to normal life, but stays alert.\" The press release lists statistics as of May 23 that are indicative of Israel's progression through the pandemic. Daily infection rate: At the peak of infection there were over 10,000 patients per day; As of yesterday there were only 12. Weekly infection rate; At the peak there were over 8,600 patients; As of yesterday there are only 27. Patients in critical condition: At the peak there were 1,228; Today - 59. Active cases: At the peak there were about 88,000; Today - 510. Infection rate: At the peak we reached about 10% confirmed cases. Today we are at about 0.1%-0.2%. Israel's Ministry of Health also released a press release on June 1, 2021, that the Green Pass and Purple Badge were \"cancelled\".

            "claim [Claim]: DeWine \"took $1.9 million from big banks,\" \"supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions\" and \"protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The Democratic political playbook has a new page that is getting flipped to the most in 2010—running against Wall Street. Whenever possible this year Democratic candidates are linking their Republican opponents to one of the primary bogeymen for the country’s economic recession.The Ohio Democratic Party uses this tactic in a web ad focused on former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for Ohio attorney general, even going so far as to call him a \"lap dog\" for Wall Street. The ODP attack rolls everything bad about Wall Street into one big ball evoking big banks, Wall Street villain and convicted swindler Bernie Madoff and predatory lenders.The video says that while in Congress, DeWine \"took $1.9 million from big banks. DeWine supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions. He protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes.\"PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into these claims that paint DeWine as a pawn of the Wall Street elite.The most straightforward one is that DeWine took $1.9 million from \"big banks.\"ODP officials say it’s easy to get $1.9 million. Just add up DeWine’s career fundraising totals on Open secrets.org — the handy federal fundraising tracker from the independent Center for Responsive Politics — as well as more than $62,000 raised in the current AG’s race.While the math checks out, you can get to the $1.9 million figure only by adding in money not only from commercial banks ($595,677) but also securities and investment firms ($726,375), miscellaneous financial institutions ($348,548) as well as finance and credit card companies ($237,750).The \"big bank\" claim need a pretty big tent to fit all of the qualifying financial institutions in its shade.Meanwhile, the ODP claim that DeWine \"helped Madoff make millions\" can be traced to three \"yes\" votes the Republican cast in 1995 for a bill known as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.DeWine joined 48 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the Senate. The legislation raised the burden of proof lawyers in private practice would have to show in cases of corporate fraud.That means that DeWine’s vote was \"helping Madoff make millions\" because it handcuffed private attorneys from pursuing claims as concerns surfaced \"as early as 1999\" that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, the ODP argues in an e-mail.Even if that’s true — and it’s certainly open to debate — the timing of the concerns about Madoff’s operation don’t square with the timeline as presented by the Ohio Democratic Party.In a 477-page report issued in 2009, SEC Inspector General David Kotz found that substantive complaints against Madoff were filed as far back as 1992 — three years before DeWine voted to overhaul the law.That reports states that a total of \"three examinations and two investigations\" were conducted by SEC officials but that \"a thorough and competent investigation or examination was never performed.\"Most incredibly, SEC officials even failed to take the most basic of steps to check up on Madoff. \"At no time did the SEC ever verify Madoff’s trading through an independent third-party, and in fact, never actually conducted a Ponzi scheme examination or investigation of Madoff,\" states Kotz’s report.Madoff himself called it \"astonishing\" that the check wasn’t done. \"They never even looked at my stock records,\" he told Kotz for his report, according to a December 2009 story in the New York Daily News. \"It would have been easy for them to see. If you’re looking at a Ponzi scheme, it’s the first thing you do.\"Clearly, the overriding reason that Madoff went undetected for so long is because the federal officials supposed to watch over him dropped the ball again and again.Is it possible that a private attorney could have brought forward an investigation that brought Madoff to justice if the law hadn’t been changed in 1995? Yes, it is possible, but it’s far from a sure thing, especially considering that the old law was in place for three years after initial concerns surfaced about Madoff.Besides, the law change doesn’t seem to quite equal \"helping make Madoff money,\" even if you conclude he would have been caught earlier if the old law had been in place.Lastly, the ODP accuses DeWine of helping \"to protect predatory lenders while families lost their homes.\"That charge references a pair of 2001 tabling votes that DeWine made during the debate over the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which never became law because the differences between the House and Senate versions were never reconciled.At that time, DeWine, 48 other Republicans and 15 Democrats blocked an amendment requiring that credit card companies disclose more information to consumers and giving stiffer penalties for predatory lenders. The other amendment that DeWine tried unsuccessfully to table prevented predatory lenders who violated the Truth in Lending Act from filing for bankruptcy to dodge claims.Those votes were at a time when the Ohio Democratic Party says \"families lost their homes\" in a reference to the foreclosure crisis that has walloped the state, including a record-high 89,053 foreclosure cases in 2009.However, Ohio Supreme Court statistics on foreclosures show only 43,419 in 2001.So while certainly some families were among those who lost their homes in 2001, the foreclosure numbers were about half the record-breaking foreclosure numbers that have hit the state in recent years with upwards of 80,000 a year since 2007. By then, DeWine wasn’t even a senator.Add it up, and the scorecard for the Ohio Democratic Party is far from spotless. We rate the Ohio Democratic Party’s claims as Barely True.

            "claim [Claim]: \"Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. That needs to change.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The internet has become a part of everyday American life, and people are more connected now than ever before. However, some Americans do not have access to high quality broadband services. At the Missouri State Fair, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt addressed an audience about the importance of broadband access for rural residents, saying that two-thirds of rural Missouri residents are lacking broadband access. Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. That needs to change,\" Blunt posted onTwitter Aug.8, 2017. The tweet included a video clip from the address. Blunt went on to talk about why he believes broadband is necessary. He also went on to discuss how he is an advocate for broadband issues on the Senate floor. Blunt’s remarks got us thinking: Are two-thirds of rural Missourians really lacking access to the service? A spokesperson for Sen. Blunt pointed us to aWall Street Journal piece, as well as somepast research by the PolitiFact teamas the sources backing the statement. Before we delve deeper into the issue, let’s establish what \"broadband\" means. The FCC describes it in a 2016 report as the speed benchmark of25 Mbpsdownload speed and 3 Mbps upload speed for fixed (not mobile) services. The FCC is required by a portion of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to report on whether Americans are able to access advanced telecommunications capabilities. They define this as,\"‘high-quality’ capability that allow users to ‘originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video’ services.\" Basically, high-speed internet. In the same report, the FCC said 10 percent of Americans lack access to broadband — 39 percent of rural Americans and 4 percent of Americans living in an urban area. Currently, many rural Missourians use alternatives to broadband like DSL, or digital subscriber line, which uses the same two-wire copper telephone line used for landlines. Some people just use their phones for internet, but for Northeast and Northwest Missourians, it’s tough to get service. Surprisingly, 8 percent of rural Missourians still use dial-up internet. While 39 percent of rural Americans live without access to broadband internet, that figure jumps to 61 in Missouri, according to the FCC. Missouri is lagging compared to surrounding states. Forty-nine percent of rural residents in Kansas are without broadband access, 56 percent in Illinois, 37 percent in Iowa and 48 percent in Arkansas. The lack of access affects everything from telemedicine to searching for jobs. It even touches agriculture: Janie Dunning, Missouri Farm Bureau’s consultant for broadband, said farmers utilize technology in order to do \"precision farming.\" By combining computers and farm equipment, production can increase, and business can be easier to manage. Further, when looking ata map provided by the FCC, we can see that in Missouri, even when rural areas have broadband access, most of those residents only have one provider option. It gets worse. \"One caution on using broadband maps and data — you need to understand how ‘access’ is being counted,\" said University of Missouri Extension state specialist for community development Sharon Gulick. \"In many cases as long as one person or business in the zip code has access, that zip code is considered covered. Also, having it available and it being affordable are also two very different issues.\" In most rankings, Missouri is around No. 40 to 47 when it comes to broadband access, Dunning said. Missouri has over 6 million people living it, 70 percent of whom are in urban areas and 30 percent in rural areas, Dunning said. So with almost a third of the population residing in rural areas, how are there so many without broadband? When looking at people per square mile, the state average is 87.1 people per square mile. In urban areas, that number skyrockets to 5,000 people per square mile; conversely, some rural areas have as few as one or two people per square mile. \"Even non-profit providers need a return on investment,\" Dunning said. \"Providers prioritize the urban areas since there’s more people who will use their services. It’s just more financially feasible.\" Blunt said that nearly two-thirds of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. FCC numbers back up his statement. Experts agree that Missouri has a broadband access issue, and all cite the same FCC report. The 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC states that 61 percent of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. The report is the most recent and uses a benchmark of of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for high-speed internet. While 61 percent isn’t 2/3, it’s nearly so, especially in the context of the statement. We rate Blunt’s claim True.\n",

This is evidence of match-fixing between India and Afghanistan.\n",
            "[Evidences]:A video of Indian men’s cricket team captain Virat Kohli and his Afghan counterpart Mohammad Nabi has been doing the rounds on social media with match-fixing claims. Keeping hope for the semi-finals alive, India on November 3 made a big win over Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup 2021. Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi, who won the toss, had decided to bowl first. India defeated Afghanistan by 66 runs. Soon after India’s victory, several social media handles, particularly from Pakistan, started trending conspiracy theories that alleged match-fixing between India and Afghanistan. In this context, a video from the toss session of the match started circulating with the claim that Kohli asked Nabi, who won the toss, to choose bowling. The claim also says it was on Kohli’s advice that Afghanistan decided to field first. In the video, Nabi shakes hands with Kohli after winning the toss and we can hear either of the men say “bowl first”. Later when the commentator asks Nabi his choice, the Afghan captain says, “Yeah we will bowl first”. The caption to one such video uploaded on Facebook reads, “Just watch the video and listen carefully kohli is saying to nabi, you are gonna ball first. fixing spotted” In some of the viral videos circulating with the same claim, we can only hear the discussion between Nabi and the commentator, while the volume is too low at the beginning of the video. The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here and here. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the video is misleading. In the video, it is Nabi who told Kohli that the Afghan team is going to bowl first. Also, it is a common code of conduct in cricket for the toss-winning captain to tell whether their team will bat or bowl first to the opponent captain. AFWA probe We found a better version of the viral video on the four-hour full match uploaded on OTT streaming platform Disney+Hotstar. Around 2:30 minutes into the video, we can see Virat Kohli tossing the coin and Nabi calling ‘head’. The umpire then says it is head and declares Afghanistan as the winner of the toss. Following this, Nabi shakes hands with Kohli. Here we can clearly hear Nabi saying “We will bowl first” to Kohli and Kohli replies: “Okay”. It is also noteworthy that Virat cannot be seen moving his lips during this time. Moreover, both umpires and a commentator are present next to the captains. After this, the commentator can be heard asking Nabi, “It’s head! Nabi, what are you going to do?”, and Nabi replies, “We will bowl first”. We also checked the toss session of a few other matches in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2021 and found the captain of the team winning the toss telling their decision to the opposing captain before declaring it. For instance, in the October 29 match held in Dubai between Afghanistan and Pakistan, at around 4:40 minutes into the match video on Hotstar, we can see Nabi - who won the toss - shaking hands with Pakistan captain Babar Azam and telling him that his team is going to bat first. We also checked “ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021 Playing Conditions” uploaded on the website of ICC. Clause 13.5 of the conditions clearly states the captain of the team winning the toss shall inform his decision to the opposing captain. “As soon as the toss is completed, the captain of the side winning the toss shall decide whether to bat or to field and shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of this decision,” the clause reads. AFWA reached out to Premdip Chatterjee who is currently an umpire on the panel of BCCI. Speaking to us about the viral video, Chatterjee said, “There is nothing speculative about the video. Around the world, whether it is an ICC or BCCI match, the captain of the team that wins the toss shakes hands with the opposing captain and informs whether they will bat or field first. The captain will also notify the same decision to the match umpire. And this decision is irreversible.“ We also spoke to Tinu Yohannan, former Indian cricketer and current coach of the Kerala Ranji cricket team. Reiterating the words of Chatterjee, Tinu said that what is seen in the viral video is a practice often followed in cricket, where the captain who wins the toss notifies his decision to both the opposing team and the umpire. And this takes place in the presence of the umpire and the commentator, so that there is no scope for foul play, he added. According to media reports, after social media handles from Pakistan started spreading conspiracy theories about India’s win against Afghanistan, Pakistan cricket legends Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis had rubbished the claims and asked the fans not to spread rumours. It is hence clear that the video in question does not show Virat Kohli suggesting the Afghanistan captain to field first. In the video, Nabi, who won the toss, is notifying Viral about his decision to field first, and this is a common practice in cricket. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim This video shows the Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli asking his Afghan counterpart Mohammad Nabi to choose bowling after the latter won the toss in the match held on November 3 between the two countries in the T20 World Cup 2021. This is evidence of match-fixing between India and Afghanistan. Conclusion In the video, after winning the toss, Nabi says, “We will bowl first”, not Kohli. According to the T20 World Cup playing conditions, the captain of the side winning the toss shall decide whether to bat or to field and notify the opposing captain and the umpires of his decision.

Citing the offences listed under Sections 427 and 2/3 of the Public Property Act 1985, it says that individuals can be imprisoned for three years. The offences include damaging mosque property, obstructing mosque functioning or operations, staff, or intimidating any member affiliated with the mosque. The offences are categorised as non-bailable. The image is widespread on Facebook and Twitter with the claim that the change has been brought about by the Rajasthan government.

This slideshow requires JavaScript. Fact-check Alt News will investigate the claims being made in the picture one by one. 1. Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act came into effect in 1984. However, the notice has erroneously written ‘1985’. The Act has provisions that cover punishment for causing damage to public property. According to the Act, public property is defined as any property which is owned by, or in the possession of, or under the control of the Central Government; any State government; any local authority; any corporation established by or under any Central, Provincial or State Act; any company or any institution. Damage to this property is punishable by imprisonment of at least one year or a fine. There is also a provision for bail in this legislation. The Act talks about punishing offenders for causing damage to any public property, not just mosques. 2. IPC Section 427 As per Section 427, individuals who commit mischief and thereby cause loss or damage to the amount of Rs 50 or more would be punished under this section with a jail term which may extend to two years and/or a fine. How are laws framed? The Legislative Assembly has the power to draft laws on 66 subjects in the State List. Apart from this, it can also introduce legislation on 47 subjects on the Concurrent List. However, these cannot be in contradiction with laws made by the Parliament. In such cases, only the law made by the Parliament would be in effect. Any bill passed by the State government is sent to the governor and passed after his approval. There have been no reports on such a bill being introduced or any such Act being passed in the Rajasthan Assembly. Neither is there any information to corroborate the claims in the viral image on the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly website. The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Act 2021 was recently introduced in the Assembly. Rajasthan government debunks viral notice Lokesh Sharma, OSD to Rajasthan’s Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, clarified that the image is fake. Rajasthan police also posted a tweet denying the claims in circulation. A fake image was, therefore, circulated on social media with the false claim that the Rajasthan government amended Sections 427 of the IPC and 2/3 of the Public Property Act 1985 in order to protect mosques/madrasas.

            "[Evidences]:U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., often stresses her Texas ties, peppering her public speeches, social media posts and debate remarks with references to her experience as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston, a law student at the University of Texas at Austin and later as a law professor back in Houston and Austin. One anecdote in particular has become a frequent refrain for the Democratic presidential candidate: When she attended the University of Houston, her tuition was $50 a semester.

And then, at 19, I fell in love, got married and dropped out — woo hoo. Now, a good life, a life I had chosen. But I thought that was it and I’d lost out on the chance to be a public school teacher. I thought I gave that up. \"We were living outside of Houston and that’s when I found it. A commuter college, 45 minutes away that cost $50 a semester. For a price I could pay with a part-time waitressing job, I finished my four-year diploma, I became a special education teacher. I lived my dream job.\" Warren did not explicitly reference the University of Houston, but she has named the school multiple times in other versions of the same statement. \"It's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston,\" she said in an October tweet. Today, tuition at the University of Houston costs about $4,000 per semester for an undergraduate student taking 12 hours. Is it true that Warren paid $50 when she attended the same school? University records show that tuition for Texas residents taking a full course load while Warren was enrolled was $50, but additional fees brought the total cost of attending the school up to about $100 a semester. Chris Hayden, spokesman for Warren’s campaign, said it was clear her claim was referencing tuition and not associated expenses. He highlighted multiple occasions when Warren specified that she was talking just about tuition. In Warren’s 2014 memoir titled \"A Fighting Chance,\" she discussed paying for her education. \"The University of Houston was about forty minutes away, and tuition was only $50 a semester,\" she wrote. The $50 amount also makes an appearance in a Medium post by Warren outlining her proposal for universal free public college, posted in April 2019. \"I thought my dream of teaching was over,\" she said in the post. \"But then a friend told me about the University of Houston, a public four-year college about 40 minutes away. We were a young couple, watching every nickel. I figured I couldn’t afford it. But it turned out that tuition was just $50 a semester.\" Warren graduated from the University of Houston in 1970, according to a copy of her curriculum vitae. At PolitiFact’s request, the University of Houston provided university bulletins detailing information such as tuition and fees for fouracademic years around the time of Warren’s graduation: 1966-67, 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71. Across the four academic years, the tuition varies based on a student’s residency (Texas residents pay less in tuition) and the number of hours a student registers for each semester. For Texas residents taking 12 or more hours, the maximum amount listed, tuition during all three academic years was $50 a semester. But there were other expenses students enrolled at the university during those years were required to pay each semester, including a Student Services fee, a University Center fee and an Academic Building Use fee. Warren describes the university as a commuter college, implying that she lived at home and traveled back and forth to campus to attend her classes, which would negate costs associated with room and board. During the 1966-67 academic year, when Warren likely started at the university, tuition was $50 a semester and the other fees were about $39, assuming Warren took a full course load and only during fall and spring semesters. That brings Warren’s grand total to $89 a semester, which doesn’t include the cost of books or other school supplies. During the 1968-69 academic year, tuition was $50 a semester and other fees totaled $41. That brings Warren’s grand total to $91 a semester, again excluding the cost of books or other school supplies. During the 1969-70 academic year, tuition was $50 a semester and other fees totaled $55. That brings Warren’s grand total to $105 a semester. Warren was not enrolled at the university during the 1970-71 school year, but tuition and fees per semester that year totaled $108 for Texas residents. Warren said that the University of Houston cost her $50 a semester while she was a student. It would have been more accurate for Warren to have said that tuition at the University of Houston was $50 a semester, a claim she has made multiple times in the past. When considering associated fees and expenses, the total cost per semester was closer to $100. Warren has repeated the accurate version of this statement multiple times since at least 2014. Overall, her claim is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. \n",

            "[Evidences]:The video was published on Twitter here on January 5, 2021. It has been viewed more than 17,000 times. Part of the post's caption, written in traditional Chinese, translates to English as: “The scale of the Washington DC Jan 6 epic rally will far exceed that of any previous ones in the United States. There will be 4-7 million people. The duration has been changed from one day to one and a half days. The video shows the US active servicemen on the street to enter Washington, saluting and welcoming Trump supporters to go to Washington.” The post was published shortly before a \"Save America\" rally in Washington DC on January 6, 2021. The event resulted in Trump's supporters storming a session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's election win, triggering unprecedented chaos and violence at the heart of American democracy and accusations the president was attempting a coup. Security forces fired tear gas to drive out the flag-waving crowds after they entered the US Capitol. Police said a woman, reportedly a Trump supporter from California, was shot by police and killed. Three other deaths were reported on the Capitol grounds but the circumstances remained unclear. Here is an AFP report on the events. The video was also shared here, here and here alongside a similar claim. The claim is false. A reverse image search on Google and Yandex based on keyframes from the footage, followed by a keyword search, found a longer version of the video here on YouTube on August 21, 2013. The title reads: \"SSGT Tim Chambers\". The video in the misleading post corresponds with the YouTube video from the one-minute four-second mark. Below are three screenshot comparisons between the misleading Twitter video (L) and the 2013 YouTube video (R): Another keyword search found Tim Chambers, a US marine veteran, posted a photo from the video on his Facebook page on August 2, 2016. The same image can be seen at the 33-second mark of the footage. Below is a comparison of the video in the misleading post at the 33-second mark (L) and the cover photo of Chambers’ Facebook page (R): Chambers earned the name \"The Saluting Marine\" for his appearances at the Memorial Day weekend parade in Washington DC by Rolling Thunder veterans. He became known for standing and holding a salute -- sometimes for hours -- as motorcycles passed by. Here is an interview with Chambers on the official YouTube channel for the US Marines in 2016.

This image is from a flare up in 2012 of tensions between China and Japan over islands in the East China sea. The picture shows a smaller boat from China being surrounded by the Japanese Coast Guard as it left one of a cluster of uninhabited islands, which are controlled by Japan under the name the Senkaku islands but claimed by China under the name the Diaoyu islands. Japan considers the waters around the islands their territory, and regularly dispels protesters or visitors to the deserted islands. However, while the description of the image is incorrect it is true that Australia turns back anyone undertaking an \"unauthorised boat voyage\". Under Operation Sovereign Borders , which was set up in 2013, boats are either sent back out of Australian waters, or passengers are brought ashore and sent back to their origin country via plane or other methods. Information on the number of these \"turnback\" operations, and how they are conducted, is limited and may be incomplete , and multiple sources have noted the lack of details from the Australian government around such \"on-water matters\".\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Donald Trump said refugees from dangerous locations have flooded the United States ever since a federal judge halted his executive order. \"72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA & YEMEN,\" Trump said on Twitter Feb. 12. 72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA & YEMEN Trump has a point that almost three-quarters of refugees entering the United States in that period are from countries targeted in his immigration ban. This might be explained by the turbulent situations that drive refugees from their homesand the on-again, off-again travel ban placed on refugees. It's also important to remember the pool of refugees we're talking about is about 1,400people. Trump’s data comes from information maintained by the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center. The center has an interactive tool that allows the data on admissions to be sifted by country and date. From Feb. 3 to Feb. 11, the percentage of refugees arriving from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was about 72 percent or 1,049 out of 1,462. (Judge James L. Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the order on Feb. 3, a decision upheld on appeal.) Here’s a breakdown of arrivals by country: The majority of refugee admissions were from Syria and Iraq, followed by Somalia and Iran and then 37 Sudanese refugees. No refugees were recorded from Libya and Yemen. The makeup of refugees entering the United States looked a little different after Trump’s first day as president Jan. 20. Basically, there were more refugees arriving from other countries. In the week before his Jan. 27 order, the United States processed 2,108 refugees. The percentage of refugees from the seven countries in the order was lower,but 44 percent (as opposed to 72 percent) were were from those seven countries. The number of refugees entering the United States from the seven countries targeted in the order has steadily increased since Feb. 3, while the refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order has fallen, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. On Feb. 11, Trump tweeted \"Our legal system is broken!\" and cited a report in the Washington Times showing that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since had been from the seven \"suspect countries.\" Our ruling Trump said that 72 percent of the refugees admitted into United States between Feb. 3 and Feb. 11 were from seven countries his executive order targets. According to the Refugee Processing Center, of the 1,462 refugees entering the United States between that time frame, roughly 72 percent were from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Sudan. No refugees were from Libya and Yemen. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/364b2394-dfb6-425b-ba8e-5811aa0694f0\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A recent study says coconut oil removes 93% of colon cancer cells in 2 days\n",
            "[Evidences]:A misleading article from 2018 with a headline saying consumption of coconut oil can eliminate “93%” of “colon bad cells” in two days has recently been resurrected and shared on social media. It also makes a number of inaccurate claims. On March 14, a story titled, “Coconut Oil Removes 93% of Colon Bad Cells in Only 2 Days” — published by website Health Miracle Pedia (healthmiraclepedia.com) on Dec. 4, 2018 — was reshared on social media by at least three Facebook pages: Ian Veneracion, Jodi Sta. Maria, and Kaibigan Lang Pala. The first two pages are posing as official accounts of Filipino celebrities. This came some weeks after the Philippine government announced that it is looking into the potential of virgin coconut oil as a treatment for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The report, citing a “University of Adelaide” study as its source, made a hodgepodge of claims on colon cancer, a research on lauric acid, and the health benefits of coconut oil. VERA Files looked into the article and found that, of the 10 claims made, only three are true. Four are misleading and three need further context. On coconut oil and lauric acid “removing” colon cancer cells This is unsupported and misleading. The academic study cited in Health Miracle Pedia’s story made no such conclusion. The University of Adelaide research, conducted in 2013, looked into the potential of lauric acid in inducing apoptosis or cell death of colon cancer cells. The study found that certain concentrations of lauric acid induced apoptosis in two kinds of cells used in the experiment: cultured cancer cells taken from the human colon (Caco-2), and small intestinal cell lines from rats (IEC-6). While coconut oil does contain 80 to 90 percent saturated fat — 47 percent of this being lauric acid — the study makes no mention of coconuts. The researchers said they purchased and used sodium lauric acid from chemical and biotechnology company Sigma-Aldrich for the study. It is wrong to claim that drinking coconut oil will have the same effect on colon cancer cells as the lauric acid used in the research, which was dispensed in calculated doses. Oncologist Necy Juat, a member of the Philippine Society of Medical Oncology, also said in an interview with VERA Files that the potential effect of lauric acid on colon cancer cells could have been “anecdotal” and should not be treated as an alternative to medical treatment. This is misleading. It was not a conclusion made by the researchers. The specific finding in the study closest to Health Miracle Pedia’s claim was the significant reduction in cell viability observed in Caco-2 cells 48 hours after being treated with a “cytotoxic dose” of lauric acid. Cell viability, in the context of the study, is the amount of cancer cells that are alive relative to the total amount of cancer cells used in the experiment. Reduction in cell viability means there are more dead cancer cells than living ones. In the study, the cell viability of human colon cancer cells decreased to 7.0 percent in 48 hours, suggesting that the remaining 93 percent of the Caco-2 cells were killed by the dose of lauric acid applied to them. However, Health Miracle Pedia failed to mention that the reduction in cell viability happened only after the cancer cells were treated with “cytotoxic doses.” Cytotoxic literally means “toxic to cells.” Cytotoxic agents are substances which “kill cells, including cancer cells.” It does not only affect cancer cells, but all cells in general. Several studies had warned of the importance of proper dosing of drugs in cytotoxic chemotherapy. Underdosing could lead to “reduced effectiveness” of the treatment, while overdosing could bring about “life‐threatening adverse effects.” Moreover, the research was performed in vitro. In vitro studies are conducted outside a living organism, usually done in a made-up and controlled environment like a test tube or a petri dish. It is misleading to assume that the results of an in vitro study would be reflected exactly in a similar, in vivo study — or that which is performed inside a living body. Juat warned of this danger: “If you have a study in the laboratory, hindi ‘yan pwede i-translate (you cannot translate it) to a human — unless you do a phase 1,2,3,4 clinical trial. ” Clinical trials, which usually come in four phases, are performed to evaluate the effect of new tests and treatments on humans. While the decrease in glutathione levels and the increase of oxidative stress were used in the study as two of the indicators of cancer cell death, the relation of the two with each other was not explicitly mentioned and established in the research. However, the study found that higher doses of lauric acid were able to induce apoptosis in the IEC-6 cells — or the small intestinal rat cells — even without significant reduction in glutathione level. This suggests that lauric acid could still possibly bring about apoptosis “independent” of glutathione availability in the cancer cells. It also found that lower doses of lauric acid on human colon cancer cells caused the decrease in glutathione levels “without inducing high levels of apoptosis.” This, on the other hand, suggests that the reduction of glutathione level in colon cancer cells brought about by certain lauric acid doses “may not be the only contributing factor in the induction of apoptosis,” the study stated. Lauric acid does not readily “poison” cancer cells in any condition. As shown in the University of Adelaide study, lauric acid needs to be applied in certain doses to be able to at least encourage cell death of — and not immediately and easily kill — colon cancer cells. Moreover, the study speaks only for effects of lauric acid when applied to cultured colon cancer cells that are already outside of a living body. According to a 2010 study on saturated fats in mammalian milks published in the journal Lipids, human milk does, indeed, contain lauric acid. However, the amount of lauric acid in breast milk varies per individual. A 1997 study conducted by the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, Oregon, published in the American Journal for Clinical Nutrition, hypothesized that there is a “rapid transfer” of fatty acids from a meal to a woman’s human milk. Fatty acids — lauric acid included — in women’s breast milk were found to increase following their consumption of formulas containing a variety of fatty acids. On the other hand, a more recent study published in journal Nutrients in 2017, showed that the percentage of lauric acids — among other acids — in human milk changes depending on the health of both the lactating mother and her infant. On coconut oil as a treatment to chemotherapy side effects The Health Miracle Pedia article did not specify which study it used as the basis for this claim. But a 2014 study conducted in Malaysia and published in the journal Lipids in Health and Disease, found that consuming virgin coconut oil — not just any coconut oil — while undergoing the six cycles of chemotherapy treatment “improve[d] the functional status and global quality of life of breast cancer patients.” The study further concluded that it “reduced the symptoms related to side effects of chemotherapy.” Virgin coconut oil uses fresh coconut meat, while regular coconut oil uses copra, or coconut meat that has already been dried. On characteristics of colon cancer According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer ranks second among the leading causes of death in the world in 2018, taking the lives of an estimated 9.6 million people that year. Colorectal cancer or cancer in either the colon or rectum is the third most common type of cancer globally, next to lung and breast cancer. However, in terms of cancer-related deaths lung cancer holds the highest record, with 1.76 million deaths in 2018. Colorectal cancer comes in second with 862,000 deaths recorded. Colon cancer was not among the top 10 global causes of death — which included several communicable and non-communicable diseases, and road injuries — in 2016, according to a 2018 WHO report. While it is true that risk factors of colorectal cancer include family history, one’s diet remains a possible but not a certain contributing element to a person’s development of colon cancer. Additionally, there is still “limited evidence” proving that the consumption of red meat is directly connected to one’s development of colorectal cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer of WHO has categorized red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans” only. While there is a “positive association” between red meat and colorectal cancer, “other explanations for the observation could not be ruled out,” WHO said. Other known risk factors of colorectal cancer are age, personal history, inherited risk, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, race, and obesity, according to the United States’ National Cancer Institute. This process is called metastasis, or when cancer cells from one organ or region of the body spread to other parts of the body by travelling through the blood or lymph system, forming a new tumor there. A cancer which has already reached distant parts of the body is called a metastatic cancer. This is true. Aside from those mentioned, other symptoms of colorectal cancer include stomach cramps, a change in bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, frequent gas pains, bloating, and vomiting.

The imported doses will cost Rs 995.40 per shot, said Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, the company’s partner in India. “I’m happy to say that we’re hopeful that it’ll be available in the market next week. We’re hopeful that the sale of the limited supply that has come from there (Russia), will begin next week,” said Niti Aayog’s VK Paul via Mint.

            "[Evidences]:Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “We have shut down nearly 90 percent of the online sex-trafficking business and ads.” — Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), in a video released by the House Judiciary Committee, July 20, 2018 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In April, President Trump signed into law a bill, often known under the inelegant name of FOSTA-SESTA, that purportedly aims to cut down on online sex trafficking. (There was a House bill known as FOSTA, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, and a Senate bill, SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. Rather than try to merge them, Congress simply added much of the SESTA language to FOSTA.) In a self-congratulatory video posted on July 20 by the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, Wagner, the key sponsor of FOSTA, made a claim that caught our attention: “We have shut down nearly 90 percent of the online sex trafficking business and ads.” Advertisement This seems a data point worth exploring, but it’s taken some time to come up with the numbers. Let’s explore. The Facts Regular readers of the Fact Checker may recall that in 2015 we debunked several faulty or misleading claims about sex trafficking made by members of Congress, including Wagner. Sex trafficking is a horrific crime, but real data is sparse and often exaggerated. Wagner, for instance, had claimed that the Justice Department estimated that 300,000 girls in the United States were at risk of being sex trafficked. But it turned out it was not a Justice Department figure but a number plucked out of a stale, decades-old study that had not been peer-reviewed and was largely discredited. We were pleased when many lawmakers stopped using such phony statistics — and anti-trafficking organizations scrubbed them from their websites. Advertisement A 2016 study funded by the Justice Department concluded that the total number of juveniles in the sex trade in the United States was about 9,000 to 10,000. The study also found that only about 15 percent of the children relied on pimps and that the average age of entry into the sex trade was 15.8 years. Nevertheless, FOSTA-SESTA swept through Congress with overwhelming support on the basis of concerns that the Internet allows the sex trade to flourish in secret, in contrast to street corners. The law gave federal and state prosecutors new tools to go after websites on which sex is sold and also made it easier for trafficking victims to file lawsuits. Moreover, the law targeted not just sex trafficking but all consensual sex work by adding an exception to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Before passage of FOSTA-SESTA, platforms and Internet service providers were not held responsible for user-generated content, but the law changed that so that they would be held responsible for ads for sex work. Advertisement Previously, sex-work websites such as Backpage would be able to cite Section 230 to get lawsuits dismissed. Most of the ads on Backpage were for consensual sex work, but a Senate investigation turned up evidence that Backpage knowingly facilitated the underage sex business by editing ads posted in its “adult services” section to eliminate terms such as “Lolita” and “Little girl.” Unrelated to the passage of FOSTA-SESTA, federal prosecutors on April 6 seized Backpage and shut it down, announcing that the chief executive had pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution. At least initially, sex workers such as escorts, sensual-massage therapists and dominatrixes said the closure of Backpage meant a significant loss of income and made the business less safe because it was harder for them to vet potential clients. Now let’s turn to Wagner’s quote: “We have shut down nearly 90 percent of the online sex-trafficking business and ads.\" Advertisement When asked for evidence, Wagner’s office sent a chart that tracked all sex-related advertising, saying that it showed weekly global ad volume dropped 87 percent from January to April. The chart was generated through a system called Memex, developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). DARPA Memex has since evolved into Tellfinder, managed by Uncharted Software. But there are some problems. The biggest drop in ads came after the shutdown of Backpage, which came even before Trump signed FOSTA-SESTA into law. Wagner’s staff noted that a drop also took place after the laws achieved final passage in Congress on March 21, prompting sex-oriented websites such as CityVibe and the Erotic Review to begin to shut down in the United States. “The DOJ’s shutdown of Backpage certainly contributed to these numbers,” a Wagner aide said. “FOSTA also serves as a deterrent to other websites that may consider entering this space.” Advertisement Okay, but what happened after April? Wagner’s staff refused to share the data, so we asked first DARPA and then Uncharted Software for the information. Under Tellfinder, all sex-trade ads globally are tracked, counting unique URLs observed by the search engine. Often at the beginning the month there are spikes that indicate when the search engines first observes an ad because many of the websites don’t publish the date when an ad is posted. Well, it turns out that after that initial drop, advertising for the sex trade appears to have rebounded, such as on new websites that mimic Backpage with names like “Bedpage.” Worldwide ads had a daily average of about 105,000 when FOSTA-SESTA passed on March 21 and had dropped 28 percent by the time Backpage was closed on April 5. It then plunged another 75 percent and reached a low of 19,456 on April 17, for a total decline of about 82 percent. Advertisement But on the day the Judiciary Committee posted the video, sex-trade ads were back at about 50 percent of the daily volume before the law had passed; as of Aug. 11, they were at almost 75 percent. (Watch the video above.) “The volume of ads dropped dramatically after the shutdown of Backpage but has been climbing since,” said Chris Dickson, director of research engineering at Uncharted. “There is now a volume approaching what we observed before.” However, he added, “it’s an open question as to whether the websites now have gotten much better at making it look like they have a lot of content or if the advertising really is back to where it was. It’s likely somewhere in between, but it’s too soon to definitively answer this.” There is little doubt that the law has had an impact in other ways. Sites such as Reddit, Craiglist and Skype began to change their terms of service and ban sex workers from their platforms. But other sites, such as Switter, have sprung up for U.S. sex workers, according to USA Today. Switter’s website operates from countries where sex work is legal, thus avoiding U.S. restrictions, and as of late June, Switter had more than 100,000 members on its site. Advertisement Wagner, in the Judiciary Committee video, celebrated a decline of “sex-trafficking business and ads” but as we noted, the metric she is using is advertising for all sex work. The actual impact on “sex trafficking” is unknown. In a House floor speech in July, Wagner made it clear she equates sex work with sex trafficking. “Signing FOSTA into law has decimated the online sex trade that fuels human trafficking in America,” she said. “Scores of major websites that promoted sex trafficking and prostitution have shut down.” The Pinocchio Test Wagner may be sincere in her belief that sex work in general fuels human trafficking but it’s a bit of stretch to say a 90 percent decline in sex-trade ads means there is a 90 percent decline in the sex-trafficking business. There’s really no way to be sure, and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise. Advertisement In any case, the 90 percent drop in sex-work ads was a one-time event, sparked mostly by the demise of Backpage, not the FOSTA-SESTA law. By the time the Judiciary Committee video was released, sex-work advertising had begun to rebound — and it keeps going up, despite the law. Wagner should not seize on a single, stale data point to tout the effectiveness of the law. She earns Three Pinocchios.

            "claim [Claim]: Says \"the one person (Donald Trump)has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton. She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Republican voters can’t count on Donald Trump to appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice, said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. With the unexpected passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative legend, Republicans are hoping to thwart President Barack Obama’s chance to nominate a liberal replacement in his final year. Their hope is that the next president will be a Republican who would pick a conservative appointee. Trump, however, \"does not care about conservative justices on the court,\" Cruz said of his opponent, in a Feb. 14 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. \"You know, the one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton,\" Cruz said. \"She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge. And he said she would make a terrific justice.\" We wondered, who is Trump’s sister, and has Trump said he only wants his sister on the court? Who is Trump’s sister? Trump’s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in New Jersey. Cruz is correct that President Bill Clinton appointed Barry to this post in 1999. Prior to this position, Barry was a federal judge for the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. President Ronald Reagan nominated her for that post in 1983. Is Barry a \"hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge,\" as Cruz said? Barry isn't one for trumpeting her political views, and she has avoided talking to reporters. The New York Times wrote a profile of her in August, for example, but she declined an interview. So we’re limited in what we know about her politics. Trump himself said in a Feb. 15 press conference, \"I don’t even know what her views are.\" We think Cruz is referring to the fact that Barry wrote the majority opinion in a2000 panel ruling that found a New Jersey law banning partial-birth abortions to be unconstitutional. \"It is clear that the Act is unconstitutional because it creates an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion,\" Barry wrote. An interesting tidbit: Current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, was also a Third Circuit judge at the time. He heard the partial-birth abortion case, too, and sided with Barry, arguing that the Supreme Court had ruled similar bans unconstitutional. So it seems a bit unfair to pin Barry as \"hardcore pro-abortion\" based on this case alone. We couldn’t find any other indications of Barry’s position on abortion. Trump addressed the issue in his book The America We Deserve, saying Barry declined to answer questions about her personal views on abortion at her 1999 Senate confirmation hearing. We were unable to locate a transcript of the hearing. Barry is a well-respected judge on the federal appeals court, which is where quite a few Supreme Court justices come from. But would Trump actually appoint her? He’s only kidding, he says. Trump did say his sister would make a \"phenomenal\" Supreme Court justice, but he was quick to say he wouldn’t appoint her. Back in August, Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin asked Trump if there was anyone he would consider for the court if the opportunity came up. Trump declined to name specific people. But then Halperin asked, \"How about your sister?\" \"I think she would be phenomenal,\" Trump said. \"I think she would be one of the best, but frankly I think she is — we'll have to rule that out now, at least temporarily.\" And in an October interview with Fox, Trump added that Barry would probably decline the offer, as she is \"very happy where she is.\" Minutes after Cruz’s This Week interview Feb. 14, Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he would nominate his sister. Trump said that he was just kidding back in his August Bloomberg interview. \"My sister, she also happens to have a little bit different views than me, but I said in that in a very joking manner,\" Trump said. \"But my sister obviously would not be the right person. It's a conflict of interest for me.\" Cruz also said Trump has only suggested his sister as a potential nominee. That may have been accurate for a while, but at a Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina — the day before Cruz made this claim — Trump named two potential nominees, neither of whom are members of the Trump family. Trump suggested Diane Sykes, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Bill Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit. Both are conservative George W. Bush appointees. Cruz was the only other candidate at the debate to float a name: Mike Luttig, a former federal judge for whom Cruz clerked in Virginia. A spokesman for Cruz's campaign emphasized that up until the debate, Trump hadn't named anyone but his sister as a potential Supreme Court pick Our ruling Cruz said of Trump, \"The one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton. She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge.\" Cruz’s claim is misleading. Yes, Trump said his sister would make a good Supreme Court justice. But he said he wouldn’t appoint her, and he has named two other potential nominees. And yes, Clinton elevated Trump’s sister to the appeals court. But Cruz leaves out that Reagan appointed her to the federal bench in the first place. Trump’s sister did join in ruling a New Jersey ban on partial-birth abortions unconstitutional. It’s worth noting that Justice Alito — hardly a \"hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge\" — joined in that opinion. Cruz twisted and left out facts to make a faulty claim about Trump’s views on the Supreme Court. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Democratic recall opponent Mahlon Mitchell sent a letter \"encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The memory might be dim now. But one of the flashpoints in the 2011 fight over public employee unions in Wisconsin was a boycott of businesses that supported Gov. Scott Walker.The effort was launched in the days before and after Walker signed a bill that sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.That was back in March 2011. But in a Milwaukee TV interview broadcast May 13, 2012, less than a month before Wisconsin’s historic recall elections, GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch reignited the boycott issue in the context of one of the recall’s top issues: jobs.Sitting alongside Mahlon Mitchell, her Democratic challenger, Kleefisch spoke on WISN (Channel 12) about the importance of creating jobs.Then she turned to Mitchell, who is president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, and this exchange ensued:Kleefisch: \"Sir, when you send out a letter encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies as the head of the firefighters union, I don't know how that helps job creation.\"Mitchell: \"That’s just not true, that’s just not true. I didn’t send out a letter to boycott a hundred companies. You show me that letter because that’s not true.\"Kleefisch: \"Sure.\"We’d like to see the letter, too, as we examine what role Mitchell, a political newcomer, played in the boycotts.Indeed, it was Mitchell’s role as a sharp Walker critic -- and the fact he opposed Walker’s collective bargaining changes even though his union was exempt from them -- that first gave him political prominence.To back Kleefisch’s statement, Kleefisch campaign manager Rachel Pecor provided a letter that was dated March 10, 2011 and signed by Mitchell and six other public employee union leaders.The letter was sent to Tom Ellis, president of what was then the Milwaukee-based M&I Bank. M&I has since been acquired by BMO Financial Group.The letter noted that Ellis was a campaign contributor to Walker. It demanded that M&I Bank publicly oppose Walker’s reform law, which limited most state and local government employees to collectively bargain over wages only.If M&I didn’t comply, the letter said, the letter signers would \"publicly and formally boycott the goods and services provided by your company.\"M&I clearly is a single business, although it had well over 100 branches in Wisconsin.Pecor also provided a March 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article reporting that Mitchell and the other signers of the M&I letter made the same demand a day later in a letter to the Kwik Trip convenience store chain.Kwik Trip is a family owned company with more than 100 stores in Wisconsin.So, it’s clear that Mitchell signed not one but two boycott letters. Kleefisch claimed they urged boycotts of more than 100 \"companies,\" which isn’t technically correct, although the two targeted companies each had more than 100 business locations.Pecor also provided a Journal Sentinel article from later in March 2011 indicating that, according to the state chamber of commerce, the boycott had targeted additional businesses; and another Journal Sentinel article reporting that a state employees union was circulating letters to businesses threatening a boycott.Pecor acknowledged there wasn’t proof that Mitchell had signed any other letters urging boycotts beyond M&I and Kwik Trip. But she argued that the larger boycotts were \"encouraged\" by the Mitchell letters. She also cited a list of more than 100 businesses that, according to the pro-recall Scott Walker Watch group, were targeted for boycotts.Mitchell campaign spokesman Kevin Benish said Mitchell signed only the two boycott letters because M&I and Kwik Trip had received government aid but mistreated employees. Benish tried to downplay the letters, saying they didn’t actually threaten boycotts, though they clearly did.Benish said Mitchell didn’t endorse and couldn’t control any boycotts efforts undertaken beyond M&I and Kwik Trip. Asked whether Mitchell opposed any of the other boycott efforts, Benish didn’t provide any evidence that Mitchell had.Our ratingKleefisch said Mitchell sent a letter \"encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies.\"Mitchell signed boycott letters to two businesses, each of which had more than 100 locations. Eventually, the boycotts targeted more than 100 individual businesses.That was the thrust of Kleefisch’s statement, although she overreached by saying Mitchell sent a letter specifically encouraging a boycott of more than 100 companies.In short, her statement is partially accurate but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:An image of a saint, known as Prahlad Jani is doing rounds on social media with a claim that he recently passed away. The post also mentioned that he was meditating for 80 years without food or water. A Facebook user shared the post with the text: “ये सन्त प्रहलाद बाबा जो 80 वर्षो से बिना अन्न ~ जल ग्रहण किये बिना ये तपस्या भगवान की भक्ति में लिन थे ये कल इनकी मृत्यु हो गई भगवान इनकी आत्मा को शांती दे शिव ~ शिव यह हमारे सनातन धर्म के सुपरस्टार हैं आज अगर कोई हीरो मर जाता पूरे फेसबुक पर छा जाता हमारे समस्त सत्य सनातन धर्म सबको पता लगे इसलिए सभी से अनुरोध करती हूं कि जिस तरह बॉलीवुड के हीरो मर जाते हैं उनके लिए चिल्ला चिल्ला कर फेसबुक पर तुम जो रोते हो कम से कम अपने सत्य सनातन धर्म को भी देख लिया करो” (English Translation: This Saint Prahlad Baba, who took this penance in devotion to God without food and water for 80 years. He died yesterday. May God give peace to his soul. Lord Shiva, he is the superstar of our Sanatan Dharma. Today if any hero dies, It would have all over Facebook. Let all from Satya Sanatan Dharma come to know. so I request everyone that the way Bollywood heroes die, the way you cry on Facebook by shouting for them, at least see your true Sanatan Dharma too. take it ) Here’s the link to the above post. FACT CHECK NewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be misleading. We a ran keyword search and found that as per Google, saint Prahlad Jani passed away on May 26, 2020. The search led us to multiple reports published in 2020 about his demise. A report by TOI dated May 26, 2020, stated that Prahlad Jani also known among devotees as Chunriwale Mataji passed away at the age of 91 due to illness. A report by Times Now mentioned that Jani, who claimed to have survived without food or water for more than 70 years, died in his native village Charada in Gujarat. According to a report by Jagran Josh, he was living in a cave in the rainforest near the Gujarat temple of Ambaji since 1970. The report also mentioned that two observational tests have been conducted on Prahlad Jani, one in 2003 and another in 2010. In 2003 at Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad, India, Dr Sudhir and some physicians observed Prahlad Jani for 10 days. He stayed in a sealed room. In 2010, Dr Sudhir Shah and a team of more than 30 researchers from the Indian Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), as well as other organisations studied his vitals via clinical examinations, blood tests and scans. The surveillance was reportedly followed using CCTV cameras and personal observations. A report by ABC News dated May 31, 2010, also mentioned that he was kept under observation for 15 days at Sterling Hospital in Ahmedabad. “We realized that, if this whole phenomenon really exists in a human being even for 15 days, it would have immense application in unravelling secrets of medical science and its application for human welfare,” a statement from a scientific group, that included the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, said. The above information proves that even though the claim about him surviving without food or water for more than 70 -80 years is unproven, he passed away back in 2020. Hence, the claim is misleading.

            "[Evidences]:There is no evidence of fraud. The data provided by the conspiracy theorist Shiva Ayyadurai is incorrect. An infographic on Facebook shows a breakdown of the election review in the state of Arizona, which took place over the weekend of September 24, 2021. The data in the image on the post shows that there were apparently 17,322 \"duplicate\" ballot papers in the Maricopa County State elections, implying that Biden's win was not legitimate. Maricopa County has confirmed that this data is incorrect and that there is no evidence of corruption during the 2020 Presidential election. The audit, which was carried out by a partisan, Republican group, came about after the Republican-backed state of Arizona demanded a recount of the 2020 Presidential election results, over allegations of fraud during the voting process. However, the review found that Biden in fact got a slightly higher share of the vote, with 99 additional votes for Biden and 261 fewer votes for Trump. In response, a number of Trump supporters have made baseless statements to cast doubt over the legitimacy of the recount. The graph doing the rounds on Facebook was created by \"Dr\" Shiva Ayyadurai, a known conspiracy theorist who once incorrectly claimed to have invented e-mail. According to Politico, Ayyaduri is not a medical doctor and has made numerous false assertions under this guise, including that U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is connected to the \"deep state\", and that vitamins can be used to cure COVID-19. A YouTube video shows Ayyadurai presenting his findings, where he claims that he found that thousands of voters cast their ballot twice. Maricopa County addressed the claims on its official Twitter account, clarifying that an expert review had found no evidence of forgeries. \"Every time a voter has a questioned signature or a blank envelope, we work with that voter to cure the signature. That's our staff doing their job to contact voters with questioned signatures or blank ballots. Only one ballot is counted,\" it tweeted. It added that the case of Ward vs Jackson had already found no evidence of duplication and that each of the ballots brought forward matched a phone number provided. Two independent reviews of Maricopa's software and equipment found no evidence of tampering, hacking, on vulnerabilities within its system. Eleven cases of alleged electoral fraud were brought to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, but all were dismissed. There is no evidence of fraud in the Arizona elections or the review, and Joe Biden remains the winner of the U.S. 2020 elections.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The video -- viewed more than 2,000 times -- shows a camp where people can be seen lying on bunk beds inside tents. A man off-camera can be heard criticising the government for housing Pakistani pilgrims in \"terrible\" conditions. \"The most expensive hajj in history, but they don't even have water for drinking and washing,\" reads an Urdu-language Facebook post that shared the video on July 2. \"Ultimately, who controls the Ministry of Religious Affairs?\" The post criticises Pakistan's \"imported government\" -- a reference to the administration that replaced ousted prime minister Imran Khan, who has accused the United States of conspiring to remove him from power. It also accuses Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government of committing \"injustice\" towards Pakistanis performing hajj. Pakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs is the agency responsible for pilgrims from Pakistan. It prepares hajj packages that provide food and board at subsidised rates to Pakistani pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims spend a portion of the hajj in Mina, a valley around seven kilometres (four miles) from Islam's holiest site Mecca. Mina is transformed into a tent city each year, according to media outlet The National. A shorter version of the video was viewed thousands of times alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here; and on Twitter here and here. Pakistani media outlet Daily Ausaf also used some of the footage in a report claiming it shows pilgrims complaining about the current premier Sharif. It has been viewed more than 300,000 times. The clips circulated online as Saudi Arabia welcomed hundreds of thousands of Muslims from overseas for the biggest hajj pilgrimage since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the video has been shared in a misleading context. A reverse image search on Google found footage from the video in this report by Pakistan's G News Network (GNN), which was published on August 10, 2019. \"Pakistani pilgrims complain against history's most expensive hajj and the lack of adequate facilities,\" the anchor says in Urdu-language. \"No water for washing, severe heat with no air conditioners and men and women were housed in the same tent.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the video from the misleading posts (left) and the GNN report (right): The full three-minute 35-second video was also shared in Facebook posts here and here on August 10 and August 11, 2019. Pakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs also dismissed the claim that the video was filmed recently in a tweet published here on June 30, 2022. \"Old video\", reads Urdu-language text superimposed over a short clip from the video. The tweet reads: \"False rumours of an accident in Saudi Arabia / videos of protests are circulating on social media. Today is the first of Dhul-Hijjah and the tents in Mina have not been put up yet. The people reject political propaganda during a sacred activity like the #hajj\". سعودی عرب میں حادثے کی جھوٹی افواہیں/ احتجاج کی ویڈیوز سوشل میڈیا پر زیر گردش ہیں۔ آج یکم ذی الحجہ ہے اور ابھی منی کی خیمہ بستی آباد ہی نہیں ہوئی۔ عوام #حج جیسی مقدس عبادت میں سیاسی پراپیگنڈا کو مسترد کرتی ہے۔@Pk_FactChecker@MuftishakoorJUIpic.twitter.com/RUkrDoHfu7\n",

            "claim [Claim]: An autumn 2018 outbreak of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce was caused by a decision by President Trump to reverse existing rules on agricultural water inspection.\n",
            "[Evidences]:U.S. government officials reported three major outbreaks of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in 2018. One was associated with ground beef, but two others associated with romaine lettuce garnered widespread news coverage throughout the year. The first outbreak, during the spring, affected 210 people in 36 states and led to 96 hospitalizations and five deaths, while the second outbreak began in October and was still ongoing as of 4 December. Up to that date, 43 people in 12 states had been infected, with 16 of those requiring a visit to the hospital. On 25 November 2018, a viral tweet placed the blame for the autumn E. coli outbreak at the doorstep of President Donald Trump himself, claiming that his alleged decision to overturn Obama-era regulations about farm water testing was the cause of the outbreak. Dr. Eugene Gu. a controversial surgeon with outspoken progressive views and a large following on Twitter, posted the following claim: We have an outbreak of E. Coli O157:H7 which makes you vomit blood, have bloody diarrhea, and even pee blood as you lose your kidneys. It’s all because Trump overturned Obama-era rules to test our farm water. Farmers save $12 million so that we pay $108 million in medical costs. We have an outbreak of E. Coli O157:H7 which makes you vomit blood, have bloody diarrhea, and even pee blood as you lose your kidneys. It’s all because Trump overturned Obama-era rules to test our farm water. Farmers save $12 million so that we pay $108 million in medical costs. — Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) November 25, 2018 Dr. Gu’s claim, that the November 2018 outbreak of E. coli was “all because of” a purported decision made by President Trump or his administration to overturn existing regulations, was off the mark in a few ways. Postponed, not “overturned” First, the Trump administration did not “overturn” the regulations in question. Rather, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed (rather than definitively ruled) that compliance dates for beginning agricultural water inspections should be pushed back by four years. Moreover, the decision to offer that proposal was taken by the FDA itself and was not the result of a directive from President Trump. In his tweet, Dr. Gu appeared to allude to a set of regulations introduced in January 2016 that tightened standards and procedures around testing agricultural water for contaminants, including the presence of E. coli bacteria. As is standard practice for many new or enhanced agricultural or environmental regulations, businesses and farms were given time to get up to speed with the demands of the new rules. This preparation time is known as a “compliance period.” However, in September 2017 the FDA proposed extending these compliance periods after consulting with stakeholders from the agriculture industry. The 2016 regulations imposed different requirements and compliance periods for (broadly speaking) two kinds of farms: those involving sprouts and those not involving sprouts. This bifurcation was due to the fact that sprouts are unusually vulnerable to contamination due to what the FDA described as the “warm, moist and nutrient-rich conditions needed to grow them.” For all other farms, here is a breakdown of the compliance dates for beginning water testing under the original 2016 rules and under the FDA’s proposal to extend the compliance periods: Although the FDA only proposed pushing back the compliance dates, the agency also made it clear that they would not be enforcing the original compliance dates, stating: “The FDA does not intend to enforce the agricultural water requirements for covered produce other than sprouts while the rulemaking to extend the compliance dates is underway.” This meant that, in effect, the first of the three compliance dates (26 January 2018) had been postponed. However, the original compliance dates for the other two of the three categories of farm had not passed by the time the October 2018 E. coli outbreak began. This is important to bear in mind when evaluating Dr. Gu’s claim that the outbreak was “all because” of the decision to push back compliance dates. If the outbreak began in a farm or farms with an annual product value of less than $500,000, then the FDA’s decision was likely unrelated to the October E. coli outbreak. That brings us to the second weakness in Dr. Gu’s claim. Causes unknown As of 4 December 2018, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had not identified the exact cause and source of the autumn 2018 E. coli outbreak, although the agency did advise consumers to avoid romaine lettuce harvested in the Central Coastal region of California, adding “If you do not know where the romaine is from, do not eat it.” On their website, the CDC outlined how “Shiga toxin-producing E. coli” (STEC), the specific type of E. coli found in the autumn 2018 outbreak, can spread: Infections start when you swallow STEC — in other words, when you get tiny (usually invisible) amounts of human or animal feces in your mouth. Unfortunately, this happens more often than we would like to think about. Exposures that result in illness include consumption of contaminated food, consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk, consumption of water that has not been disinfected, contact with cattle, or contact with the feces of infected people. Some foods are considered to carry such a high risk of infection with E. coli O157 or another germ that health officials recommend that people avoid them completely. These foods include unpasteurized (raw) milk, unpasteurized apple cider, and soft cheeses made from raw milk. Sometimes the contact is pretty obvious (working with cows at a dairy or changing diapers, for example), but sometimes it is not (like eating an undercooked hamburger or a contaminated piece of lettuce). People have gotten infected by swallowing lake water while swimming, touching the environment in petting zoos and other animal exhibits, and by eating food prepared by people who did not wash their hands well after using the toilet. Almost everyone has some risk of infection. So although the CDC identified romaine lettuce from a particular region of California as being related to that outbreak, it remains unclear how the infection spread and what role, if any, agricultural water may have played in carrying the bacteria. This lack of knowledge about the cause of the outbreak is an added reason to cast doubt on the notion expressed in Dr. Eugene Gu’s viral tweet that allegedly lax water inspection standards were to blame for the autumn 2018 E. coli outbreak.\n",

Numbers on inflation in the country and abroad were also fudged.But they exaggerated the growth of the Lagos economy under Tinubu’s governorship and misled about the influence he had on revenue.Both APC office-bearers sought to talk up the APC’s economic gains, particularly in Lagos state under former governor Bola Tinubu who is running for president in the February 2023 elections.Nigeria’s election campaign season only officially begins 28 September 2022, but political parties are already in top gear in the race to win over voters.President Muhammadu Buhari will step down after February 2023 elections, having first been elected on an All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket in 2015.The party has picked Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state and an influential APC member, as its new standard bearer.In two separate media appearances in August 2022, the APC made its case as to why it should be re-elected.First up was Kashim Shettima, who will be the vice president should the party win. Among the claims he made was that Tinubu improved the fortunes of Lagos so much that it was “now the third largest economy in Africa”.Tinubu was governor from 1999 to 2007 and has remained influential in state politics.A day later, APC campaign spokesperson Festus Keyamo was on TV where he also talked up the records of both the party and Tinubu.Keyamo, who is the junior minister for labour and employment, challenged his host to fact-check him.So we did, by taking a look at eight claims from both appearances.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Amidst unprecedented security measures , South Africa's President Jacob Zuma delivered his tenth State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2017. We fact-checked his speech . Energy Claim \"To date, nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have the electricity.\" Verdict correct South Africa's development indicators showed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further 233,455 were connected in 2014/15 and 231,012 were connected in 2015/16 . Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released. Zuma's claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016. As of 2016, 90,3% of South African households had access to electricity for lighting. - Kate Wilkinson Education Claim \"Among the participating countries [in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in mathematics and 90 points in science.\" Verdict correct The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science. Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested. The 2015 study found that South Africa's Grade 9 pupils recorded the \" biggest positive change \". There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics. The report goes on to note that \"South Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015\". While South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa's Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate Wilkinson READ: South African pupils not 'second worst in the world' in maths & science Claim \"Government also settled all debt owed by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students.\" Verdict misleading The media unit of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check to a lengthy statement issued by the scheme earlier this year . It stated that \"t he historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved\". However, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university. First, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students. South African students from the University of Cape Town listen to Western Cape premier Helen Zille during a meeting at the university in May 2011. Photo: AFP/GIANLUIGI GUERCIA\" /> \"Students who are still studying, dropped out or graduated within the stipulated academic years\" can have these loan payments effected, the NSFAS statement said. Second, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students' previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Third, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students' academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meet graduation requirements during their final year of study . Finally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or \"capital\" amount owed by the student to the university. Kagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students' historic debt. NSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand's NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that \"some outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS\". As such, the \"historical debt\" has not been \"settled\" but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading. - Vinayak Bhardwaj READ : FACTSHEET: Funding & the changing face of SA's public universities Claim \"A total of 173 inappropriate [schools] have been eradicated since 2011.\" Verdict correct The department of basic education replaces unsafe and \"inappropriate\" school structures under the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi) programme which started in 2011. As of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced, a department presentation to the select committee on basic education showed. At the time of Zuma's speech, the department's figures showed that 173 had been replaced . The latest figure displayed on the department's website puts the number of schools at 174. The programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially, 496 schools were identified as \"inappropriate structures\". Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14. - Kate Wilkinson Employment Claim \"In terms of the 2015 to 2016 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management levels amounted to 72%, while African representation was at 10%. The representation of coloureds stood at 4.5%, and Indians 8.7%.\" Verdict incorrect The commission for employment equity compiles an annual report on employment equity for the department of labour. The data in the report is submitted once a year by designated employers, which include employers who employ 50 or more employees, employers who employ fewer than 50 employees but have a certain annual turnover, as well as municipalities, all levels of government, state-owned companies and educational institutions. The 2015/16 annual report showed that 68.9% of top management workforce was white, 14.3% was black, 8.6% was Indian, 4.7% was coloured and 3.5% was foreign. The breakdown of management levels by population group: Top management Senior management Professionally qualified Skilled technical Black 14.3% 21.2% 41.2% 58.8% White 68.9% 58.1% 38.0% 22.0% Indian 8.6% 10.2% 8.5% 5.9% Coloured 4.7% 7.4% 9.4% 11.6% Foreign 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% 1.7% - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"The expanded public works program has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities towards the attainment of the target of 6 million work opportunities by the end of March 2019.\" Verdict correct Data from the expanded public works programme supports Zuma's claim. Nearly 2.5 million job opportunities were created between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. Total work opportunities 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 497,624 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 741,540 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 1,103,983 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 154,965 Total 2,498,112 Work opportunities are not permanent jobs, however, and in most cases only last a few months. The department of public works notes that \"the same individual can be employed on different projects and each period of employment will be counted as a work opportunity \". So while nearly 2.5 million work opportunities were created, this does not mean that the same number of people benefited from the programme. - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"Of the [more than 2 million] work opportunities created, more than 1 million have been taken up by the youth.\" Verdict correct This claim followed on from Zuma's previous statement, in which he said that \"the expanded public works programme has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities\". Africa Check was unable to find fourth quarter figures for 2013/14. However, even without them, the expanded public works programme reports show that 1,129,516 job opportunities were filled by young people. This was 45% of all work opportunities over the period. - Kate Wilkinson Total work opportunities for youth 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 222,587 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 340,663 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 566,265 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 - Total 1,129,516 Income inequality Claim \"White households earn at least 5 times more than black households, according to Statistics South Africa.\" Verdict mostly-correct Statistics South Africa's 2014/15 Living Conditions of Households Survey reported that black African households had an average income of R92,983 per year. In comparison, white households had an average income R444,446 per year. Based on these figures, white households' income is on average 4.8 times more than black households. - Kate Wilkinson Population Group Average annual household income Black R92,983 Coloured R172,765 Indian/Asian R271,621 White R444,446 National average R138,168 Economy Claim \"Only 10% of the top 100 companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are owned by black South Africans... according to the National Empowerment Fund.\" Verdict incorrect Zuma was wrong. In fact, his statement contained two errors. Top 17 financial services companies Africa Check asked the National Empowerment Fund (NEF), a government mandated fund tasked with facilitating economic equality and transformation in South Africa, for the research Zuma's claim was based on. They provided the organisation's 2017 submission to parliament's standing committee on finance. The research contained in the submission only looked at a \"sample analysis of the top 17 financial services companies by market capitalisation as listed on the JSE\" - not the top 100 companies, as Zuma held. The research refers to 31 December 2016 and was conducted by Intellidex , a South African capital markets and financial services research house. 10% = target The submission made no reference to black-ownership of the JSE equalling 10%. \"The study shows that the financial service sector companies have achieved an average of 6% against the direct equity target of 10%,\" the NEF told Africa Check. - Kate Wilkinson READ: Black ownership on SA's stock exchange - what we know Water Claim \"...about 10,000 unemployed youth are being trained as plumbers, artisans and water agents\" Verdict unproven In his 2015 State of the Nation Address, Zuma announced that 15,000 artisans, plumbers and water agents would be trained as part of the War on Leaks initiative. The department's 2015/2016 annual report noted that 3,000 artisans started training last year, while an additional 7,000 trainees were to join their ranks in August. The department's spokesman, Sputnik Ratau, was unable to confirm to Africa Check how many young people started training in August 2016. ( Note: We will update this report when Ratau supplies the figures for the second intake. ) However, he said the programme is still on-going and that a third intake of trainees would take place this year. - Gopolang Makou & Katleho Sekhotho READ: How many SA municipalities lose more than 37% of their water? We don't know Housing Claim \"Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than 4 million houses since 1994.\" Verdict incorrect Data from the department of human settlements shows that 2,835,275 houses were built by government between 1994/95 and 2013/14. A further 95,210 were built in 2014/15 and 100,339 were built in 2015/16 . This brings the total number of houses delivered to 3,030,824 - around a million less than Zuma claimed. It is possible that Zuma was referring to the delivery of both houses and serviced sites. This, however, is not a house. It is a piece of land, which should be supplied with water, electricity and sanitation, on which a recipient can build their own house. When serviced sites are included, the number of \"housing opportunities\" delivered rises to 4,060,795 as of 2015/16. However, concerns have been raised over the accuracy of the housing statistics. Experts caution that since the figures have not been independently verified they should be viewed as \" indicative rather than entirely conclusive \". - Kate Wilkinson FACTSHEET : The housing situation in South Africa Gender Claim \"At the level of gender, at senior management level males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4%.\" Verdict correct The commission for employment equity's 2015/16 annual report showed that 67.6% of employees at senior management were men and 32.4% of employees were women. - Kate Wilkinson Agriculture Claim \"There has also been a 19% decline in households involved in agriculture from 2.9 million in 2011 to 2.3 million households in 2016.\" Verdict correct The Agricultural Household section in Stats SA's 2016 Community Survey shows that households involved in agriculture decreased from 2.88 million in 2011 to 2.33 million in 2015. The statistical agency indicated that the drop can be attributed to the drought between 2014 and 2015. Using the unrounded figures, the drop is 17%, not 19%. - Gopolang Makou Tourism Claim \"O ur tourist arrival numbers for the period January to November 2016 increased to 9 million, an increase of just over 1 million arrivals from 2015. This represents a 13% growth in tourism arrivals.\" Verdict correct Statistics South Africa records the monthly tourist arrivals in South Africa. It downloads the data covering a specific calendar month from the department of home affairs. The total number of tourist arrivals between January and November 2016 adds up to 9 million, as Zuma stated.

The increase between 2015 and 2016 therefore is 13%. ( Note: Figures for December 2016 has since been released. With 965,107 tourist arrivals recorded, the total for 2016 is 10,044,163, compared to 8,903,773 in 2015 - also a 13% increase. ) However, arrivals in 2015 were much lower than the corresponding periods in 2014 and 2013, when more than 8.5 million tourists arrived between January and November in each year. - Vinayak Bhardwaj & Ziyanda Ngcobo Social grants Claim \"Social grants now reach close to 17 million people, mainly older persons and children\" Verdict downplayed Figures supplied to Africa Check by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), shows that the agency paid out more than 17 million grants at the end of January. Of those, 3,283,286 were recipients of the grant for older persons. By far the largest number of grants were for child support, with more than 12 million people receiving this type. - Julie Bourdin Grant type Number Old age grant 3,283,286 War veteran's grant 185 Disability grant 1,069,802 Grant in aid 159,515 Child support grant 12,039,444 Foster child grant 411,133 Care dependency grant 143,824 Total 17,094,331 Read: FACTSHEET: Social grants in South Africa – separating myth from reality Environment Claim \"We welcome the decline in rhino poaching incidents since October 2015 which is for the first time in a decade.\" Verdict unproven Consolidated figures for rhino poaching in 2016 have not yet been released. The latest figures were provided by the department of environmental affairs in a September 2016 media release . This was confirmed to Africa Check by departmental spokesman, Albi Modise. Between January and August 2016, 702 rhinos were poached countrywide, compared to 796 rhinos between January and July 2015 and a total of 1,175 rhino poaching incidents for the whole year, as recorded by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime . While this does indicate a decline in the incidents of poached rhino s (40 fewer incidents were recorded in 2015 than in 2014), this is a relatively small decline when compared to the steady increase in poaching incidents since 2008. Africa Check will only be able to verify this claim once the 2016 figures have been released. - Gopolang Makou Year Recorded incidents 2008 83 2009 122 2010 333 2011 448 2012 668 2013 1,004 2014 1,215 2015 1,175 Crime Claim \"Within the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit completed 389 forfeiture cases to the value of R349 million.\" Verdict correct Following a successful investigation or prosecution, the money that is recovered by the state from freezing orders is referred to as the value of \"completed forfeitures\". The National Prosecuting Authority's latest annual report shows that 389 forfeiture cases were completed by the Asset Forfeiture Unit during 2015/2016, like the president said. These completed cases were valued at R349.5 million, exceeding the R210 million that was projected to be recovered by R139.5 million. The annual report credits a focus on high-value cases, improved investigations and \"the increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture\" for the better-than-projected performance. The table below shows how the 2015/16 results compare to previous years: Financial year Value of completed forfeitures 2009/10 R185 million 2010/11 R212 million 2011/12 R164 million 2012/13 R119 million 2013/14 R296.4 million 2014/15 R1,939 million 2015/16 R349.5 million - Gopolang Makou Claim \"Last year, I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years.\" Verdict correct Zuma prefaced this claim by saying that collusion by cartels \"squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists\". It is likely that the president was referring to the proclamation signed in May last year which inserted section 73A into and amended section 74 of the existing Competition Act . The actual amendment act was passed by parliament in 2009, but various provisions of the amendment have been signed into effect periodically, director in the competition practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, Lara Granville , explained to Africa Check. This amendment act introduced provisions to deal with \"other practices that tend to prevent or distort competition in the market for any particular goods or services\", Granville said. Additionally, the act brings about provisions to hold personally accountable those individuals who \"cause firms to engage in cartel conduct\". The penalties for these offences are a fine \"not exceeding R500,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment\". However, the new penalties could deter people from coming forward with information about collusion, Granville said. \"While criminalisation may be an effective deterrent to cartel conduct, it may prevent people blowing the whistle about cartels to the competition tribunal due to fear of prosecution.\" - Vinayak Bhardwaj Claim \"Compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98%.\" Verdict correct Speaking about fighting crime, Zuma said one of government's strategies \"is to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again\". The department of correctional services' 2015/16 annual report shows that 51,307 of the 51,937 people (98.78%) released during that period complied with the conditions of their release. However, there are problems with this narrow reading of the figures, the director of the penal programme at the Lawyers for Human Rights , Clare Ballard, pointed out to Africa Check. \"The 'compliance' that the president refers to relates to policing aspects of parole,\" Ballard told Africa Check. That is, whether the parolee is at home when supposed to and whether the person is at home or work at a certain time, Ballard explained. The number doesn't capture opportunities to help parolees escape a life of crime, by receiving drug counselling or career advice. Furthermore, offenders serving life sentences experience significant delays in being granted parole, Ballard explained. South Africa introduced minimum mandatory sentences in 1997. In certain instances of rape and with certain types of murders the perpetrator must receive a sentence of life imprisonment, unless there are \"substantial and compelling circumstances\" that justify a lesser sentence. \"The department is clearly overwhelmed by the bottleneck that the minimum sentences have created,\" Ballard told Africa Check. Her calculations show that South Africa has more offenders serving life sentences than ever before. \"We represent hundreds of life offenders all over the country whose parole application processes have been delayed by years and years, simply because of systemic poor management of the process on the part of the parole boards, the national council of correctional services, and the minister, who has the final say on whether a life offender may be released,\" she added. - Vinayak Bhardwaj Health Claim \"The department of social development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities - in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, the Free State and Eastern Cape.\" Verdict correct The national drug master plan is South Africa's plan for reducing alcohol and substance abuse, spearheaded by the Central Drug Authority , the body responsible for its monitoring and implementation . According to the plan, the departments of social development and health will work together to provide inpatient treatment facilities at community and tertiary levels . In a 2016 parliamentary meeting , the deputy chairperson of the central drug authority, David Bayever, said that R150 million had been secured from treasury to build 4 public treatment centres in provinces that previously did not have these facilities: the Northern Cape, Free State, Limpopo (which, at the time, was completed but not functioning) and the Eastern Cape (which, at the time, was already functioning). National spokesman for the department of social development, Lumka Oliphant, told EWN and Africa Check that a treatment centre in the North West province has since been completed but that the centres in the Northern Cape, Free State as well as Limpopo (contradicting the parliamentary presentation) are still under construction. A year ago, the department said in a media statement that the Limpopo facility had already been completed. Africa Check called the Seshego Hospital near Polokwane, where the facility is situated and confirmed that the building has been erected but the centre is currently not operational. Africa Check also made calls to the centres in the North West (one located at the Taung Provincial Hospital and another located at the Witrand Psychiatric Hospital in Potchefstroom). From our calls, we gathered that the Witrand centre is currently open but the Taung facility is not yet operational. Further questions to Oliphant asking when these facilities were expected to be completed and operational were unanswered at the time of publication.

            "[Evidences]:A post is being widely shared on social media claiming that one can get blood in an emergency if he/she sends an SMS to the number 9600097000. Factly received a query on its WhatsApp tip-line number (+91 9247052470) to check the authenticity of the claim. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: To get blood during emergency, send an SMS to 9600097000. Fact: The SMS service of 9600097000 in relation to blood donation is no longer active. SMS to 9600097000 was a service started by Airtel and Jeevan Blood Bank in Chennai in 2008 to provide instant information about availability of blood. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. The SMS service of 9600097000 in relation to blood donation is no longer active. SMS to 9600097000 was a service started by Airtel and Jeevan Blood Bank in Chennai in 2008 to provide instant information about the availability of blood. According to the 2008 Press Release in Jeevan Blood Bank’s website, Airtel had started a project named “Airtel Cares for Everyone”. ‘This is a first of its kind initiative, wherein people can source information on blood within minutes and access the real-time stock of tested blood components from Jeevan Blood Bank 24 hours a day.’ SMS service through the number 9600097000 (which is now going viral but not in service with relation to blood donation presently) was given to provide information about the availability of blood. To sum it up, the SMS service of this purported number is no longer active in relation to blood donation.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says New Hampshire’s second congressional district includes two counties where \"almost 5 percent if not more\" of residents are enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program.\n",
            "[Evidences]:At a news conference last month, U.S. House candidate and state Rep. Jack Flanagan explained his vote to continue the state’s expanded Medicaid program. Flanagan, a Republican, supported the legislation because those in the second congressional district were relying on the expanded plan, he told reporters. \"When I looked at the actual layout -- Coos County, Sullivan County, there was a significant number of people -- I think it’s almost 5 percent if not more -- in those counties. So, looking ahead and knowing those people could use the support, that’s why I voted\" for the program, he said. Flanagan’s assertion caught our eye. While the overall number of those on the expanded program has been stated repeatedly – about 48,000 individuals – less has been said about who those people are and where they live.So we decided to check out Flanagan's statement. Let’s start with the district boundaries. New Hampshire’s second congressional district stretches from the very top of the state to the very bottom, and generally covers the western half. It’s currently represented by U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a Democrat. As Flanagan noted, the district encompasses all of Coos and Sullivan counties. It also includes all of Cheshire County. Much of Grafton, Merrimack and Hillsborough counties are in the district, too, along with a slice of Rockingham. That’s a lot of space, and as you might expect, use of the expanded Medicaid, which offers subsidized health care to people making less than $16,000 a year, isn’t uniform across the district. Towns and cities in sparse Coos and populated Merrimack counties face very different economic challenges, after all. The next piece of the puzzle is the actual usage of the program. The state’s Health and Human Services department has produced a number of maps through its division of Public Health Services that show, as of January, how many residents across the state use expanded Medicaid.According to this information, Coos County saw the greatest use of the expanded Medicaid program, with 5.38 percent participating. Sullivan County, the second one named by Flanagan, had 4.28 percent of its residents enrolled in the program. These figures include just the expanded program, not all Medicaid enrollees. As expected, numbers vary in the other counties included in the district. Only 3.77 percent of the population of Cheshire County is enrolled. Merrimack County has 3.75 percent of residents participating, while Hillsborough has 3.58 percent. Grafton County is broken up in an unusual way on the map -- Hanover and Lebanon are broken out. Between them, the communities have only 1.72 percent of their residents in the program. The rest of the county has a 4.19 percent enrollment. While the numbers can be sliced and diced further -- the state also issued a town-by-town breakdown of enrollments -- Flanagan was speaking about county numbers, so this rough breakdown should be sufficient. The two counties Flanagan specified, Coos and Sullivan, indeed have the highest participation rate in the expanded Medicaid program. Only the former is over 5 percent, though. Bolstering his argument, both have higher enrollments than the state as a whole, which stands at about 3.5 percent. When reached for comment, the representative pointed to the same set of data from the state. \"I was considering Coos when I made that statement, however Grafton and Sullivan counties are still high, percentage wise,\" Flanagan wrote in an email. Our ruling U.S. House candidate and State Rep. Jack Flanagan said that \"almost 5 percent if not more\" of the population of Coos and Sullivan counties were enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program. In the second congressional district, one county has more than 5 percent enrollment in the state’s expanded Medicaid program and another is pretty close. Coos county indeed breaks the 5 percent mark. Sullivan, at 4.28 percent, which have the first and second-highest participation rates in the state, respectively. We rate Flanagan’s statement True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Video shows US helicopter crashes on its side in South China Sea in April 2023\n",
            "[Evidences]:\"The US military intruded into our South China Sea, [where] a helicopter fell into the ocean after its left rear wheel got caught on the metal railing on the aircraft carrier,\" reads a post on Weibo published on April 22, 2023 written in simplified Chinese. The accompanying 29-second video was viewed more than 70,000 times. It shows a helicopter falling into the ocean after failing to land properly on the deck of a ship. The claim circulated as the United States and the Philippines held a two-week joint military exercise from April 11 to 26 in the South China Sea to counter Beijing's growing assertiveness in the region (archived link). China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea despite an international court ruling that the assertion has no legal basis. Led by the United States, Western militaries regularly conduct \"freedom of navigation operations\" with warships and aircraft to assert the international status of regional waterways, including in the South China Sea. The same video was shared alongside similar false claims on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin. While some users questioned the validity of the claim, others were misled. One wrote: \"Looks like they have a guilty conscience for intruding into our South China Sea, they don't even know how to fly the plane anymore!\" Another said: \"We must do something about the US military!\" But there have been no reports of a US military aircraft crashing in the South China Sea in April 2023. The video in fact shows a 1999 helicopter accident off the coast of San Diego in the US state of California. A reverse image search using keyframes of the video found the same footage was uploaded to YouTube on July 5, 2007 (archived link). The video shared in the misleading posts corresponds to the video's 16-second to 45-second mark. The video caption says the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter crashed while trying to land on the USNS Pecos off the coast of San Diego, California on December 9, 1999. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video shared in the misleading posts (left) and the video uploaded to YouTube (right): Further keyword searches found another similar video of the accident uploaded to YouTube in 2018, which also states in the caption that it shows the 1999 crash near San Diego (archived link). The Los Angeles Times reported on December 10, 1999 that seven marines were feared lost at sea after the Marine Corps helicopter crashed while ferrying troops between ships 14 miles off Point Loma, a neighbourhood in San Diego (archived link). The report said out of the 18 marines aboard the helicopter, \"11 were rescued from the water just minutes after the early afternoon crash, which occurred as the craft took off from the amphibious assault ship Bonhomme Richard on its way to the oiler Pecos\". The accident was also reported by the Washington Post (archived link). The Los Angeles Times later reported on June 16, 2000 that the accident was blamed on human error and deviations from safety rules (archived link). \"The investigation concluded that the helicopter came in too low and too fast in its attempt to hover over the rear deck of the oiler Pecos,\" the report read. It noted that the left rear landing gear snagged on a safety net on the rear of the ship and then spun out of control as it attempted to lift off.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says \"the mandate is 71 times that a child’s body will be injected with a disease\" for immunizations.\n",
            "[Evidences]:The Oregon Legislature just made it harder for parents to exempt children from vaccinations required for school. This does not sit well with people -- including some lawmakers -- who say parents know best when or if their children should receive shots to protect them from whooping cough and measles. Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend, voted no on Senate Bill 132. He spoke on the floor about the number of mandatory shots a child must receive in the course of his or her time in school: 71 times. \"So there’s 17 at preschool, child care or Head Start enrollment. There are 19 at K through 5 grade, there are 17 in 6th grade and there are 18 in high school, well, 7th grade through high school,\" he said. \"That’s not the number of immunizations, that’s the number of actual shots.\" He went on to say: \"Understand that the mandate is 71 times that a child’s body will be injected with a disease. It is not, clearly, something we should take lightly when balancing the parent’s opinion about what is good for the child and the fact that the mandate is for 71 injections into their child’s body.\" Yeah, we did a double take, too, when we heard that. Three score and 11 shots? We wanted to know if this was true. It turns out that in citing this fantastic number Conger relied on a fact sheet, detailing which immunizations are required for the 2013-14 school year, based on the student’s grade. Unfortunately for Conger, this is the same fact sheet relied on by a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, in showing why the representative’s statement is not accurate. The sheet lists the immunizations needed for a child 18 months or older entering preschool, child care or Head Start. The child would need four doses for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; three doses for polio; one for chickenpox; one for measles, mumps, rubella; three doses for Hepatitis B; two doses for Hepatitis A; and three or four doses against Hib disease. We count at most 18 shots. Now, when the student enters kindergarten, or any grades 1 through 5, the child needs another immunization shot against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; one more shot against polio; and one more shot against the measles. We count 21 shots total. Because, you see, the categories of immunization shots are cumulative. It’s not that the child has to receive three shots to ward off Hepatitis B in preschool, and then again in kindergarten. Let’s continue. There are no new shots needed for the vaccinated child who enters grade 6. A student entering grades 7 to 12 needs to get one booster shot against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. We count 22 vaccination shots, at most. These vaccinations apply to children in public school and private schools, Head Start, preschools and certified child care programs. Home-schooled students are subject to immunization requirements in certain situations. Separately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children receive two influenza shots in the first year and a shot once a year, thereafter, wrote Susan Wickstrom, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Health Authority. There are also vaccines for pneumococcal, meningococcal conjugate, and HPV. \"But even with annual flu shots, the total of immunization injections that a child receives before high school graduation would be less than 71,\" Wickstrom wrote to PolitiFact Oregon. She said it for us: Nowhere near 71 shots. The state requirements total, at most, 22 shots, including the Hib shots. We caught up with Conger and asked him to confirm our understanding. He did and immediately owned up to his mistake. He said he just counted up the number of shots before making his floor speech. \"I was wrong about that,\" Conger said. \"I certainly wasn’t trying to distort the truth. But I was wrong about that.\" Conger said his larger point remains: Government should be careful when curbing parental rights, he said. \"In my view, the debate around SB 132 was about the need for legislative restraint and deference to parents generally in decisions about the welfare of their children.\" We rate the statement False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A viral message listing false and unrelated statements about Coronavirus has falsely been attributed to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The UNICEF has not put out any such advisory. Moreover, most of the claims mentioned in the message are not backed by scientific evidence. Social media is abuzz with this message and it is being shared globally. The message has eight claims surrounding the prevention of COVID-19. It also states that adhering to these steps would be sufficient to protect oneself from the virus. The post is being circulated rampantly on WhatsApp in two formats: text as well as images. BOOM received the messages and the images multiple times on its WhatsApp helpline. The message is being shared as India confirms its 45th case of COVID-19. The three cases which were reported in February from Kerala have recovered. Globally, there have been over 110,000 of the COVID-19 spread across 109 countries. Fact Check The viral message has eight claims and is attributed to the UNICEF. BOOM found that none of UNICEF's social media channels nor its website mention any such advisories. Africa based Africa Fact Check stated that this message is viral even in the African continent and so they contacted a spokesperson who denied that UNICEF put out any such statement. \"The claims are not from Unicef\" a spokesperson, Geoffrey Nkoku, told Africa Check. On March 6, 2020 the UNICEF even issued a press release asking individuals to verify the information that they receive by cross checking it with the source it is attributed to and not believe in any falsehoods circulating on social media. However, these claims continue to circulate with or without attributing it to the UNICEF. These claims are not all scientifically backed and BOOM has debunked a few of these theories in the past. The claims and their facts are as follows: 1. The corona virus is large in size with a cell diameter of 400-500 micro, so any mask prevents its entry so there is no need to exploit pharmacists to trade with muzzles. Rating: Misleading Fact: The coronavirus is not a cell but an infectious agent that replicates in cells of living organisms. Research is still underway to ascertain the size of the virus. Furthermore, the World Health Organization recommends that masks should be worn by individuals who are feeling sick and not by healthy individuals. Face masks have not been proven to protect one from contracting the virus. It Instead helps decrease the risk of transmitting the virus from an affected individual to a non-affected individuals. Hoarding masks deeming them as fit to protect contracting COVID-19 is seen to have increased the demand of the masks along with inducing fear in people's mind about the same. 2. The virus does not settle in the air, but on the ground, so it is not transmitted by the air. Rating: Partly True/ Partly False Fact: The claim that the virus is not transmitted by the air is unproven as the WHO states that the virus spreads through droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. The droplets are present in the air and if a person is in close proximity of an infected person, there is a possibility that they may test positive for COVID-19. 3. The corona virus, when it falls on a metal surface, will live for 12 hours, so washing hands with soap and water well will do the trick. Rating: Partly True/ Partly False Fact: The WHO has addressed this claim in its Q&A on COVID-19. It states that it is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. Thus, the claim that the virus is active for 12 hours has not been proved scientifically but the WHO believes using a disinfectant on the surface and washing one's hands will keep the virus away. 4. Corona virus when it falls on fabrics stays for 9 hours so washing clothes or exposing them to the sun for two hours is enough for the purpose of killing him. Rating: Misleading Fact: There is no scientific evidence that states the virus can be killed once exposed to the sun. Reiterating what the WHO states for surfaces, research is still underway for the recent strain of the virus. Sharing claims that denote the virus is active for a certain time mislead and spread misinformation about the issue at large. 5. The virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes so putting the alcohol sanitizer in the pocket is enough for the purpose of prevention. Rating: Partly True/ Partly False Fact: The WHO does not specify an exact duration for which the virus is active but does recommend the use of alcohol sanitizers for preventing the virus. Alcohol based sanitizers also lead to one's hands drying up faster. Most scientists recommend washing hands with soap and water over frequently using sanitizers. 6. If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27°C, it will be killed, it does not live in hot areas. Also drinking hot water and exposure to the sun is good enough. Rating: Needs More Scientific Evidence Fact: The Coronavirus like all enveloped viruses, it is easily inactivated at high temperatures, but the exact temperature is not yet known.

            "[Evidences]:You can say what you like about spending and pork, but delivering for the district by bringing home the bacon is a badge of honor for many members of Congress. It's the reason why Rep. Tim Ryan's campaign boasts that the Niles Democrat \"has secured a grand total of $116,838,763 to date and has an additional $27,095,000 pending in Fiscal Year 2010 spending bills. \"That means more money to help promote economic growth, strengthen America’s infrastructure and improve the quality of life in the Mahoning Valley,\" the statement adds, with an exclamation point. More than $143 million is a lot of kapusta, or cabbage, as they might say in the valley. PolitiFact Ohio asked Ryan’s staff to back up the figures, and the congressman's communications director, Heather McMahon, said they were actually outdated and understated. She said that appropriations for the 17th District, \"as secured by Congressman Tim Ryan in his eight years in office,\" total $140,133,763 -- with an additional $40,200,000 pending in the Fiscal Year 2011 budget. And, she said, \"The figures do not include other grants and funds that Congressman Ryan has assisted in bringing to the 17th District\" -- notably a $20 million Department of Transportation grant signed last summer for the Kent Central Gateway project. Saying that Ryan has \"secured\" funding \"means that the congressman submitted each project to the appropriate subcommittee as a piece of congressionally directed spending that has been attached to his name,\" McMahon said. \"Projects that receive funding must be approved by subcommittee, the House appropriations committee, and also the full House.\" The directed appropriations she is describing are better known as earmarks. Ryan was well-positioned to secure them as a member since 2006 of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations and as a member of the defense appropriations subcommittee, another key panel. He topped the list of lawmakers who scored the highest dollar amounts in the House's defense bill for fiscal 2011, according to research by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense and the newspaper The Hill. Critics say earmarks contribute to runaway spending, and contend legislators can improperly use earmarks to enrich themselves. Ryan’s view is that earmarks are a way to direct federal dollars to worthwhile local projects and that they account for a tiny percentage of the federal budget. Ryan's office provided an overview of funding he secured in nine budget categories, with example projects. Defense topped the list, with a total of $61,154,000 passed and signed. The money included $17.5 million in earmarks for fiscal 2007, which Ryan inserted into a Defense Department spending bill, for Lockheed Martin's development in Akron of a high-altitude airship. Detailed breakdowns appear on Ryan's congressional website. The figures match those listed by critics of earmarks, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Center for Responsive Politics. We rate Ryan's statement as True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:After thousands of protesters had descended on Trenton in recent days, New Jersey Assembly members gathered on the evening of June 23 for what would be the final passage of the divisive pension and health benefits reform legislation.That night, Senate President Stephen Sweeney -- one of the principal architects behind the bill -- explained how the health benefit changes would impact the average worker during an \"Ask the Senate President\" interview on New Jersey 101.5 FM.\"Right now, everyone pays 1.5 percent for healthcare,\" Sweeney, a Democrat who represents the southwestern part of the state, told host Eric Scott. \"For the average worker, government worker, for the first two years, on that grid that we created, they're not even impacted. They won't even feel it until the third year where they'll see any kind of an increase.\"Two years without any increases in health care expenses?Based on the senator’s own numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey learned that Sweeney is right about the first year, but in the second year, the average worker’s costs would rise for every type of coverage -- including a nearly 80 percent jump for a family plan.First, let’s talk about the health benefits reform piece of the legislation.Signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie on June 28, the legislation requires all public employees to contribute toward their health care based on a percentage of one’s premium.The contributions, which vary according to salaries and levels of coverage, will be phased in over four years for existing employees. The new regulations apply to all employees whose contract has expired and take effect after existing contracts expire. They also apply immediately to employees not covered by a union contract.But contributions won’t go below 1.5 percent of one’s salary, the minimum amount currently paid by most public employees. Once the premium-sharing percentages exceed that minimum amount, employees would contribute according to the percentages.Now, let’s turn to that \"grid\" Sweeney referred to in the radio interview.The grid breaks down the premium percentages according to salaries. Because Sweeney referred to the \"average worker,\" we focused on someone earning $60,000, because federal data puts the average annual pay for a New Jersey state employee in that range.Based on the grid, that average worker would continue paying 1.5 percent of his salary in the first year, but starting in the second year, the percentage of premiums would increase his health care costs in each level of coverage.An average worker with family coverage would continue paying $900 in the first year, and then $1,615 in the second year, according to the senator’s grid.Sweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly, who said the senator was aware of our correspondence, acknowledged in an email that the average worker would be impacted in the second year.\"The Senate President's goal with these reforms was to create a phase in system that was as fair as possible to lower and middle income workers. He succeeded in doing that,\" Donnelly wrote in an email. \"While he firmly believes the cost of the new plans will lower premiums, if his comment that night mislead(s) anyone, he apologizes. It certainly was not done maliciously, so he hopes to avoid seeing his pants being on fire.\"But there’s one more problem with the senator’s calculation: we don’t know what the premiums will be yet.Sweeney used projected premiums in his grid, but the new legislation calls for two new committees to design new plans with an anticipated start date of Jan. 1, 2012. The senator argues the new plans could reduce premium costs.Alan Monheit, a professor of Health Economics at the Newark-based University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the average premium may be lower than it would have been under the old system, because the new cost-sharing could drive employees to opt for cheaper plans.Still, premiums depend on a group’s level of health care spending, and the recent reform is mainly focused on shifting costs, Monheit said.Let’s review:Sweeney said in a radio interview that the average worker won’t pay higher health care costs until the third year of the new health benefits reform. But the senator’s own figures prove him wrong, showing increases starting in the second year.Also, the premiums at the heart of this debate have yet to be determined by the new committees. Have no fear, senator, this statement isn’t getting a Pants on Fire. We rate the statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A video is being shared on social media claiming it as the live visuals of an Australian astronaut jumping from space. This post claims that he jumped from a height of about 40 lakh feet and reached the Earth in 4 minutes covering 1,236 kilometres distance. Let’s verify the claims made in the post. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Claim: Video of an Australian astronaut jumping onto earth from his spacecraft covering 1,236 km in 4 minutes from a height of about 40 lakh feet. Fact: The person jumping from space is an Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner, not an Australian astronaut. Felix Baumgartner made a record-breaking supersonic free fall from space on 14 October 2012, as part of the Red Bull Stratos mission. He Jumped from 1,28,097 feet or about 24 miles above the Earth and reached the Earth in less than 10 minutes. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE. On reverse image search of the screenshots shared in the video, we found similar visuals in a video published on the official YouTube channel of ‘Sky News’. ‘Sky News’ channel published this video on 15 October 2012 with the title “Felix Baumgartner skydives from the space”. In the description of the video, it is mentioned that the skydiver Felix Baumgartner made history by leaping from 1,28,097 feet above the Earth. It is mentioned that Felix Baumgartner after jumping out of a giant helium balloon, had a free-fall for four minutes and 19 seconds before opening his parachute. When we searched for more information using these keywords, we found the same video in an article published by the BBC News on 14 October 2012. In the article, it is mentioned that the Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner made a record-breaking leap on 14 October 2012 as part of the Red Bull Stratos Mission. It is reported that Baumgartner jumped from 1,28,097 feet (39,000 meters) or about 24 miles from the Earth by creating the new World’s highest skydive record. It is reported that Baumgartner has become the first skydiver to go faster than the speed of sound, reaching the maximum velocity of 833.9 mph or 1,342 kmph. Reporting the same, ‘Space.com’ website published an article on Felix Baumgartner’s record-breaking Supersonic jump. The same visuals found in the videos published on the Red Bull Stratos website. Red Bull Stratos is a high altitude skydiving project involving Austrian Skydiver Felix Baumgartner. Red Bull Stratos posted the same video on their official YouTube channel. Felix Baumgartner’s Supersonic jump was also mentioned on the ‘Guinness World Records’ website. From all these pieces of evidence, it is concluded that the person jumping from space is Austrian Skydiver Felix Baumgartner, not the astronaut from Australia. To sum it up, a Supersonic free fall video of Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner is shared as the visuals of Australian astronaut jumping from the space.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Listen 10 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “The fact is that I had zero emails that were classified.” — Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in a Twitter thread, Sept. 6 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Justice Department investigation of classified documents found at former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club has brought inevitable comparisons to the controversy over Hillary Clinton’s private email server that she used while secretary of state. The FBI investigation into her emails arguably tipped the close 2016 presidential election to Trump. During the contest between Trump and Clinton, we wrote 16 fact checks on the email issue, frequently awarding Pinocchios to Clinton for legalistic parsing. But in light of the Trump investigation, Clinton is trying to draw a distinction between Trump’s current travails and the probe that targeted her. It’s worth reviewing what we know now about the emails that Clinton received on her private server. After FBI Director James B. Comey in 2016 announced there would be no criminal charges brought against Clinton, congressional hearings and several more investigations that received little media attention revealed new details that, to some extent, mitigates what Comey said at the time. Advertisement As shown in an FBI photo of some of the documents seized from Trump, many have clear markings indicating they contained highly sensitive classified information. Clinton, in her tweet, suggests none of her emails were marked classified. That’s technically correct. Whether those emails contained classified information was a major focus of the investigation, but a review of the recent investigations, including new information obtained by the Fact Checker, shows Clinton has good reason for making a distinction with Trump. What Comey said At a July 5, 2016, news conference, Comey said: “From the group of 30,000 emails returned to the State Department, 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received.” He added that out of “thousands of emails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level.” Separately, he said 2,000 additional emails were “up-classified” so redactions could be made to make them suitable for public disclosure. During a news conference July 5, FBI Director James Comey outlined the complex investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of email while secretary of state. (Video: Reuters) This statement has generally been translated in news reports as the FBI determining that 113 emails contained classified information. Advertisement Referring to seven email chains that concerned issues classified at the “Top Secret/Special Access Program” level, Comey said: “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.” The classification dispute Note that Comey said this assessment was “determined by the owning agency.” That meant an intelligence agency, such as the CIA, had decided information in the email was classified, even if the email itself had not been marked classified. As the Fact Checker disclosed in 2016, intelligence officials believed there were serious shortcomings in how the State Department handled sensitive communications. Advertisement The State Department has both classified and unclassified systems — known informally as the “high side” and the “low side.” The classified system has tight controls, often housed in what is known as a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF); it is not possible to “cut and paste” from the classified system into the unclassified system. Clinton’s private email system was designed to deal with the unclassified communications, similar to the unclassified state.gov email account. But sometimes classified information seeped into email exchanges. In one instance, a State Department official forwarded a newspaper article; then in subsequent exchanges, aides revealed sensitive details of a secret program as they discussed the shortcomings of that public report. Ultimately, the email chain ended up in Clinton’s inbox. “The senders used unclassified emails because of ‘operational tempo,’ that is, the need to get information quickly to senior State Department officials at times when the recipients lacked access to classified systems,” said a nearly 600-page Justice Department inspector general report released in June 2018 that critically examined Comey’s decision to announce the results of the Clinton probe himself. “To accomplish this, senders often refrained from using specific classified facts or terms in emails and worded emails carefully in an attempt to avoid transmitting classified information.” Advertisement Many of the emails in question were sent late at night or on weekends, the report said. One prosecutor who worked on the case told the IG: “The problem was the State Department was so screwed up in the way they treated classified information that if you wanted to prosecute Hillary Clinton, you would have had to prosecute 150 State Department people.” “There was no evidence that the senders or former Secretary Clinton believed or were aware at the time that the emails contained classified information,” the Justice IG report said. “The emails in question were sent to other government officials in furtherance of the senders’ official duties. There was no evidence that the senders or former Secretary Clinton intended that classified information be sent to unauthorized recipients, or that they intentionally sought to store classified information on unauthorized systems.” David Kendall, an attorney for Clinton, told the Fact Checker: “The State Department personnel who originated the emails did not think their content merited classification, and not a single one of the over 33,000 emails bore classification markings.” The emails with classified markings In his news conference, Comey said “three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received.” At the time, he said one was marked “secret” and two “confidential,” but at a congressional hearing two days later, he said all were marked “confidential,” the lowest form of classification. Moreover, he acknowledged that markings — a (C) — were contained in the body of the text and, contrary to standard practice, there was no header at the top alerting someone that this was classified material. He told lawmakers that without a header, it was “a reasonable inference” that this material was not classified. Advertisement The emails concerned proposed talking points for Clinton when she called a foreign leader. The State Department later said the (C) markings should have been removed as a matter of course once Clinton decided to place the call but through “human error,” they had not been deleted. In her FBI interview, Clinton said she did not know what (C) meant and “speculated it was a reference to paragraphs ranked in alphabetical order.” The IG report said the FBI missed the (C) markings until late in the investigation. In her Twitter thread, Clinton said, “Comey admitted he was wrong after he claimed I had classified emails” — a reference to his remarks at the congressional hearing. “When he testified before the House Oversight Committee, he was forced to concede the markings he pointed to were ambiguous, did not comply with federal classification guidelines, and did not contain proper classification markings,” Kendall said. Advertisement Comey did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump State Department investigations During the Trump administration, two more investigations were conducted of the Clinton emails — first when Rex Tillerson was secretary of state and then again when Mike Pompeo was the chief diplomat. Kendall said that during the Tillerson investigation, he was told “that there was cause to believe she had been responsible for 41 mishandlings of classified information (both infractions and violations) — 40 related to particular emails and one related to the use of a private email server itself.” That’s lower than the 110 emails cited by Comey, but he said it’s possible each email chain might be considered a security infraction. Comey had referred to 52 email chains. “At the end of the process, on June 29, 2017, the Tillerson State Department agreed there was no classified material in the 40 emails cited, but found that her use of a personal email server itself was a security violation, without respect to any particular email,” Kendall said, providing a copy of the June 29, 2017, letter sent by State saying Clinton had “no individual culpability” for the email security violations. Advertisement “Though not publicized at the time, these findings were not surprising, since both the Secretary and her State Department colleagues based their emails on the work the Department was doing and did not believe any of the emails contained classified information,” Kendall said. “The Secretary and her colleagues knew how to use (and did) State’s high-side secure system for transmitting classified information and properly marked such communications when appropriate.” The second investigation started in 2019. Kendall said he was informed State “suspected” Clinton was responsible for “12 classified spillages” based on emails that had not been among the earlier incidents that were investigated. Perhaps it’s a coincidence, but the total number of security incidents investigated by State — 52 — matches the 52 email chains mentioned by Comey. The unclassified version of the Diplomatic Security investigation that was publicly released notes that “a typical security violation involves premarked classified information discovered contemporaneously with the incident. None of the emails at issue in this review were marked as classified.” Advertisement “Again, we presented evidence refuting each of these allegations,” Kendall said. “We were completely successful and were notified on Oct. 7, 2019, that the Department had found the Secretary did not ‘bear any individual culpability’ for these 12 alleged incidents, although again this result was not announced publicly.” He provided a copy of the State Department letter, dated Aug. 22, 2019. The unclassified version of the probe says it found “91 valid violations attributable to 38 individuals” but does not mention names. The report was critical of Clinton’s decision to have a private server — “it added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.” But the report concluded: “Instances of classified information being deliberately transmitted via unclassified email were the rare exception and resulted in adjudicated security violations. There was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.” In other words, both State Department probes under Trump knocked Clinton for maintaining a private server for State Department communications — but did not hold her responsible for mishandling classified information.

            "claim [Claim]: A recent spending bill had at least \"$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:It isn’t often that President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., use a similar talking point. But it happened recently with regard to funding for school safety — and neither Trump nor Pelosi was accurate. In remarks to the National Rifle Association on May 4, Trump said, \"I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security and mental health.\" Two weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence repeated that $2 billion figure in a speech in Indianapolis. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded these comments Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Pelosi, however, used much the same logic during a CNN town hall on May 23. She touted new funding for school security, using a somewhat smaller figure of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Here’s the exchange with host Chris Cuomo: Cuomo: \"The building we're in now, the building that you work in, the point of entry there is secure. You don't walk in with a trench coat with a shotgun underneath your jacket and get in. It doesn't happen. You know this. Why can't that be part of the equation? Talk about universal background checks, fine. Talk about mental health, how to identify them. The money for treatment. But why either/or? Why not make the schools safer? I know it's a state issue, but they're going to ask for money…\" Pelosi: \"It is a state issue.\" Cuomo: \"And that's where the federal government comes in. … You could offer them money to make schools so that when you go there as a guest, and you walk in, of course, they'll have multiple points of egress for emergencies. But you're going to be looked at when you go in that school and you're not going to walk in with a gun under your coat.\" Pelosi: \"In our omnibus bill that we passed just a few weeks ago, we had $1.8 billion — I think it was $1.8 billion, it could be $1.6 billion — in there for this purpose, for schools to make — to give them an opportunity to secure them. And those schools have to make those decisions.\" So, did a recent spending bill include at least $1.6 billion for school security or safety? No. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they said she was referring to the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program, known as SSAE for short. This program, run by the Education Department, has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion. However, both the dollar figure and the nature of the grants don’t hold up to scrutiny. First, while the program has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion, the most recent spending bill only provided a portion of that amount, $1.1 billion. Pelosi \"misspoke on the specific amount,\" said spokesman Drew Hammill. It’s important to remember that Cuomo’s question focused on what could be done to boost security against armed school attacks. The SSAE program, it turns out, isn’t geared exclusively toward school security. Rather, it’s focused broadly on providing \"all students with access to a well-rounded education,\" improving \"school conditions for student learning,\" and improving \"the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students.\" School violence is one of the specific areas cited in the law. The grants may also be used for improving school-based mental health services, which can ease the causes of some school-violence incidents. However, these are just two of the areas these grants can be used for. Some of the others are: • Technologies such as software, simulations, online databases, computer-based assessments, and educational access tools for rural areas. • The prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation referral, recovery support services, or education related to the illegal use of drugs. • Schools, or dedicated programs within schools, to engage students in \"rigorous, relevant, and integrated learning experiences focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including computer science.\" The explanation of the spending bill published in the Congressional Record on March 28 emphasized that SSAE grants \"can be utilized for a wide range of uses.\" While the uses mentioned in the explanation included \"school-based violence prevention strategies,\" the explanation emphasized that the bill \"encourages the department to especially support pre-kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line.\" And a House committee report describing the bill highlighted that \"programs designed to support non-cognitive factors such as critical thinking skills, social skills, work ethic, problem solving, and community responsibility are an eligible use of funds under SSAE grants supporting a well-rounded education.\" So the $1.1 billion in the spending bill won’t necessarily be spent on school security of the type Cuomo was asking about. Ultimately, \"school safety has to compete with STEM, foreign language learning, technology enhancements and numerous other educational priorities for those SSAE funds,\" said Bob Farrace, the director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. \"With that single funding pool, school leaders have to balance the need to safeguard the school with the need to make the school a place worth coming to.\" Pelosi’s spokesman, Hammill, emphasized that protecting students from attacks is about more than just hardening infrastructure. The grants, he said, promote \" ‘soft’ efforts to ensure schools can combat bullying, harassment, while offering school personnel training, mental health resources, comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services, drug and violence prevention, training on trauma-informed practices, and health and physical education.\" While those areas are covered as acceptable uses, the expressed desire by Congress is that these grants also foster such goals as boosting STEM education, digital learning and distance education — and that suggests that not all $1.1 billion will be used on efforts that address school violence, even indirectly. Responding to a question about preventing gun violence in schools, Pelosi said that a recent spending bill had at least \"$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them.\" Her office acknowledged to PolitiFact that she should have said $1.1 billion, the amount devoted to a federal grant program for schools that was funded in the bill. Still, even that figure is likely exaggerated. When the Education Department distributes $1.1 billion in grants under the program she was referencing, school security will have to fight for that money against such items as STEM education and digital education.

            "[Evidences]:John Rich, half the country music duo Big & Rich, gained huge social media attention by tying the arrest of a suspected quadruple-killer in Idaho to \"2,000 Mules,\" the widely debunked election denier film. \"They caught the Idaho killer using cellphone ping data, the exact same method used to track the #2000Mules,\" Rich told his 832,000 Twitter followers in a Jan. 5 post that quickly spread across Facebook. The tweet has received more than 100,000 engagements, including likes and retweets. \"One's praised as ‘brilliant detective work,’ the other has been vilified as ‘not credible,’\" he wrote. \"See how this works? We live in a mirrored fun house where every image is bent.\" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) This comparison falls flat: The methods to track down information using cellphone data were not exactly the same and the Idaho arrest didn’t give credibility to the movie. To find the suspected killer, law enforcement investigators used cellphone data specific to his phone and corroborated it with other evidence, including DNA. The \"2,000 Mules\" movie used aggregated and anonymized cell data to claim that people dumped 400,000 illegal ballots into drop boxes in the 2020 election. But the data showed only that people with cellphones were near the boxes, which could have been for any number of possible reasons. \"What ‘2,000 Mules’ tried to do was say that we know these people went to these ballot boxes, and you cannot definitively say that,\" said Aaron Striegel, a University of Notre Dame computer science and engineering professor. \"What you know is they might have been around them, within the city block.\" Rich and \"Big\" Kenny Alphin comprise Big & Rich, whose hit songs include \"Save A Horse (Ride A Cowboy).\" Rich is politically active. He wrote \"Raisin’ McCain,\" a song promoting the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain, a Republican Arizona senator who died a decade later. In 2017, the duo were the headline performers at a gala ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Rich previously has raised questions on Twitter about fraud and voting irregularities in the 2020 and 2022 elections. The tweet we’re fact-checking received praise from election denier Kari Lake, the Republican who lost in the November Arizona governor’s race. Bryan C. Kohlberger, 28, is charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students in a home near campus Nov. 13. Seniors Madison Mogen, 21, and Kaylee Goncalves, 21; junior Xana Kernodle, 20; and freshman Ethan Chapin, 20, were killed. Before his arrest Dec. 30 at his family’s Pennsylvania home, Kohlberger was a doctoral criminology student at Washington State University, which is several miles from the Idaho campus. To show probable cause that Kohlberger committed the killings, law enforcement investigators used cellphone tracking, video surveillance and DNA evidence on a knife sheath at the scene of the killings, a police affidavit filed in court said. That’s different from what \"2,000 Mules\" did. \"2,000 Mules,\" released in May, was produced by far-right commentator Dinesh D’Souza, who has a history of spreading falsehoods. The film alleged that \"mules\" — people it defined as collecting and returning completed mail ballots — submitted 400,000 illegal ballots in five swing states in the 2000 election. The claim was based on cellphone data conservative group True the Vote said it had purchased. The group said it bought $2 million worth of anonymized cellphone geolocation data — the \"pings\" that track a person’s location based on app activity. Experts told PolitiFact the movie’s evidence was inherently flawed. The film was also debunked by FactCheck.org, Reuters, The Associated Press and The Washington Post, which said it \"offers the least convincing election-fraud theory yet.\" Cellphone location data can determine only whether a person came near a ballot drop box, and accuracy depends on factors such as cell tower capability and topography, Striegel said. Using a comparison, he said the data can tell \"you went to a big-box store like Home Depot or Walmart, but it would be hard to say if you visited, say, a strip mall to say which store you actually went into.\" People could have passed near the drop boxes, which are typically in busy areas, for any number of reasons. \"That’s the problem with the ‘2,000 Mules,’ there just are a lot of other explanations that are viable\" for why people were near a ballot box, Striegel said, \"and that’s the primary evidence they provide.\" Cell tracking can place the location of a phone within 5 meters (16 feet) under ideal conditions, said Cooper Quintin, senior technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group. \"But you can’t show what (the people with the phones) were doing, whether they were putting ballots in or whether they were committing a murder. You have to have additional evidence for that,\" he said. We tried to reach Rich by emailing addresses on the band’s website and YouTube channel, and on Rich’s business website, but received no reply. Rich said cellphone data used to arrest a suspected Idaho quadruple-killer proves that criticism of the \"2000 Mules\" movie’s use of cell data is unfounded. Idaho police obtained data specifically for the suspect’s cellphone and used corroborating evidence, including DNA at the crime scene, to arrest him. \"2,000 Mules\" used purchased aggregated and anonymous cellphone location data, which signaled that people were near ballot drop boxes, but did not prove that the boxes were stuffed with illegal ballots. The data does not show what people were doing in those geographic areas. We rate the statement False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850,” yet experts are saying “the last one was due to climate change.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:A viral image circulating on social media ridicules the idea that climate change is to blame for a recent hurricane in Florida, noting the many hurricanes that have hit the Sunshine State over the better part of two centuries. \"Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change,\" claims the image, which includes a picture of a monkey. The image was shared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes what is the consensus view among hurricane researchers. Their message is not that climate change caused recent hurricanes, but that there is evidence that it might have made them more serious. The post also misstates the number of hurricanes. Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said there have been 140 hurricanes in Florida since 1850. The Sept. 8 post was shared by conservative commentator James T. Harris, who has more than 537,000 followers on Facebook. But neither his post nor the viral image cites a particular hurricane. The post came one day after President Joe Biden walked through a New York City neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, where he said, \"the evidence is clear. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives.\" But the text in the image has circulated since at least September 2017, when Hurricane Irma hit Florida, and some versions of the post insert the word \"manmade\" before \"climate change.\" Here’s what we found in a fact-check published Sept. 9, and one from October 2020: Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980 found that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled. The number of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. each year has not increased since a century ago, but researchers said it’s likely that global warming will cause future hurricanes to be more intense. We asked several hurricane researchers about the claim in the viral image; they agreed that climate change doesn’t cause hurricanes, but could make them more severe. \"The way we think about climate change impact on extremes, including hurricanes\" is that climate change from human activity \"can modify their characteristics,\" said Suzana Camargo, a research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. For example, the most intense hurricanes occur more often, or the precipitation associated with particular hurricanes increases, she said. As for climate change’s effect specifically on Florida hurricanes, \"it is hard to make the assessment on a specific region, as the sample size is small,\" she said. Climate change is not the cause of hurricanes, because hurricanes occur naturally, said Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center of Atmospheric Research. \"But climate change alters the ocean and atmosphere environment to make them more active. This can and is manifested in several ways: more intensity, bigger, longer lasting, and perhaps more hurricanes.\" Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said \"we don't expect to see more hurricanes in the future due to climate change — in fact we actually see fewer — but the warmer water temperatures may lead to stronger storms in the future.\" He added: \"These trends may be hard to detect for many years to come, especially for landfalling hurricanes.\" A viral image claimed: \"Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change.\" The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes their view. Experts do not blame climate change for causing hurricanes, though they say it’s a possible cause of making them more intense. The post also misstates the number of hurricanes in Florida since 1850. It has had 140. We rate the post False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Billionaire Donald Trump won an easy victory in Florida’s 2016 Republican presidential primary — so easy, he said, that he garnered an unparalleled amount of support in the process. \"Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before,\" Trump said March 21. It is true that he won 66 counties (Sen. Marco Rubio won his birthplace of Miami-Dade before dropping out of the race), but Trump’s nearly unanimous win is hardly unprecedented. We looked at county-by-county election results from the state’s Division of Elections website. Big wins aren’t altogether unusual in Florida, if you go back just a few years. Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state in the 2012 Republican primary, and both the GOP and Democrats split their primaries three ways in 2008. But in 2004, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats. That feat was repeated by both parties in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore won all 67 for the Democrats and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won all 67 for Republicans. In 1996, Bob Dole took 66 of 67 counties for the GOP primary — but really, the 67th was a tie at 190 votes each for Dole and Pat Buchanan in Washington County. Bill Clinton took 63 counties in 1992’s Democratic primary. Paul Tsongas won Alachua, Martin, Seminole and Palm Beach counties. Pat Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to incumbent president George H.W. Bush that year and won Hardee County. Bush nabbed the other 66. In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 64 counties, losing three to Pat Robertson in the GOP race. Counties were split over their Democratic candidate, but Michael Dukakis won the state. Walter Mondale and Gary Hart divided the state for Democrats in 1984, with Jesse Jackson winning one county and John Glenn two. The state’s online data only goes back to 1978, but there were enough examples to prove Trump wrong in this case. In 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100 percent of Florida counties for the Democrats. But Trump can lay claim to beating the primary record of Republican hero Ronald Reagan. The actor defeated his eventual vice presidential running mate George H.W. Bush by 64 counties to 3. In addition to Alachua County, Bush took Dixie and Union counties by a single vote. Our ruling Trump said, \"Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before.\" Trump won 66 counties, but it’s far from unprecedented for Florida primary winners to win by a huge margin. Going back even just a few decades, there are several instances of candidates winning all 67 counties. We rate Trump’s statement Pants On Fire!\n",

            "[Evidences]:Grainy video of Mitt Romney talking to big-dollar donors in Florida has the political world in a tizzy.Romney’s remarks in the secretly recorded video that 47 percent of Americans believe they are victims entitled to government help prompted a swift response from the Barack Obama campaign and a late-night explanation from Romney himself.We’ll be checking several claims from Romney’s remarks at the May 17, 2012, fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla. Here we’ll examine one we’ve heard before. It was tucked into Romney’s description of how he can win over voters who supported Obama four years ago but are disappointed now.\"Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase that he's ‘over his head.’ … The best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below 8 percent since,\" Romney said.Did Obama promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent? Not exactly. Projection or promise?The source for Romney’s statement -- and others like it -- is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called \"The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers. \"It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,\" the report states. \"There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\" There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart stating: \"Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.\"Of course, we now know the unemployment rate did exceed 8 percent. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and has decreased very slowly. In August 2012, it was 8.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Our rulingRomney told donors he could win over wavering voters by reminding them that Obama said \"he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent.\"Obama didn’t say that. Rather, his Council of Economic Advisers predicted that the stimulus would hold it to that level. Their report included heavy disclaimers that the projections had \"significant margins of error\" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is \"unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"The sub-8 percent prediction did not hold true, but it’s still incorrect to characterize it as a promise or guarantee.We rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:When PolitiFact Wisconsin Googled \"Tom Barrett\" the other day, top results included:A WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) story about Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s bid to take on Scott Walker in the 2012 recall race.A post on an education technology blog by a guy named Tom Barrett in Nottingham, England with 20,000 Twitter followers.Mayor Tom Barrett’s Wikipedia entry; his newly minted gubernatorial campaign website; and his official City Hall site (he was re-elected mayor on April 3, 2012).That’s in real life.In a campaign TV ad released March 29, 2012 by an arm of the Republican Governors Association, less neutral results appear as a woman searches on \"Tom Barrett.\"In the ad, the woman gets these search hints: \"Politician. Increase spending. High unemployment. Candidate for governor.\" As she \"finds\" some Barrett material online, she offers a running commentary.\"Tom Barrett increased spending in Milwaukee by $300 million? Huh. \"Raised taxes every year but one. Uh oh.\"\"And what did his taxes and spending do to the economy? Unemployment up 27 percent. Under Barrett, Milwaukee’s one of America’s 10 worst cities for unemployment.\"She concludes: \"Spending -- up. Taxes -- up. Unemployment -- up. Governor Tom Barrett? I don’t think so.\"The RGA ad claims on taxing and spending are not in dispute.But did unemployment jump 27 percent during Barrett’s first two terms, spanning 2004 to 2012? And was Milwaukee one of the toughest places in the United States for employment? We decided to investigate both -- and the ad’s claim Barrett’s policies were responsible.Unemployment rates are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and state agencies such as the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.We found a 26 percent increase in the number of unemployed from April 2004, when Barrett took office, to January 2012, according to the latest figures reported on the BLS site.The number is 27 percent if you do the math on the unemployment rates for those years (8.1 percent and 10.3 percent), though such comparisons are usually expressed as percentage point changes. In other words, you would typically say unemployment went up 2.2 percentage points under Barrett.But either way the RGA is pretty much on target on that piece.On the second part of the RGA claim, a top-10-worst ranking,the group’s spokesman pointed to 2005 -2007, when Milwaukee was sixth-highest for unemployment rate among large cities and to 2009, when the city was 10th.The RGA uses the nation’s 50 largest cities as a pool of comparison.If you expand to municipalities of any size, Milwaukee improves hundreds of places in the rankings. But it seems reasonable to compare Milwaukee, which is near the middle of the 50 largest cities, to its peer group.So it’s clear the city was in the top 10 for highest unemployment in four of Barrett’s first five full years in office.But what about 2008, and the most recent two years, 2010 and 2011?Milwaukee improved to 16th in 2008, and ranked 11th in 2010, when six California cities were among the worst. (The annual average for 2011 was not available as of early April 2012.)So the city’s ranking has edged out of the top 10 worst in three recent years under Barrett.One note: the TV ad subtly makes two different claims on the \"top 10\" ranking. The on-screen graphic says Milwaukee \"was\" one of the worst 10, while the narrator says that \"Milwaukee’s one of America’s worst\" -- a line that suggests the top-10 ranking is current.But either way the claim of a top-10 ranking is accurate or very close in five of the seven full years under Barrett.But the claim is about more than numbers. It places the blame squarely on Barrett and his policies (\"what did his taxes and spending do to the economy?\" asks the ad).Mayors clearly have a policy role on job creation, but state and national trends drive much of the employment picture at the local level.By the RGA’s logic, Scott Walker, as much as Barrett, could be accused of causing unemployment to soar when he was the elected executive of Milwaukee County, which includes the city of Milwaukee.Why? Because both Barrett’s and Walker’s eighth budgets included spending that was more than 30 percent higher than the budgets they inherited. (We used eight budgets for an apples-to-apples comparison; Barrett has submitted eight budgets; Walker did nine.)Separately, property taxes went up 20 percent over Walker’s first eight years, compared with 25 percent under Barrett. (Note: Walker never proposed a tax hike but used County Board levy increases as his base the following year).Our conclusionThe Republican Governors Association, which backs Scott Walker, was basically accurate on its claims, but overstates the influence of a mayor on taming unemployment.This comes in Half True.\n",

RELATED VIDEO: In May 2021, the U.S. imported more than 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. But the latest figures show a general trend downward and that by October 2021, the figure was 595,000. The Keystone XL pipeline would have been able to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day, the figure used in LaTurner’s ad. LaTurner’s office cited reports showing the two figures. But the pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day. The purpose of the pipeline was to transport oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. And, in any event, producers would be under no obligation to sell that oil to the U.S. Biden on Jan. 20, 2021, his first day in office, used the power of the executive branch to cancel the Keystone, which would have transported crude oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. From there, refined petroleum products could be sold either in the U.S. or to foreign buyers. LaTurner represents Kansas’ 2nd District, which covers the Topeka area and points south. The other major candidate for the seat is Democrat Patrick Schmidt, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer. Campaign watchers rate the race as solid or safe Republican. LaTurner said in an ad: The Keystone XL pipeline \"would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia. President Biden's energy agenda has strengthened Putin at the expense of hard-working Kansans.\" The transport capacity of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Biden canceled, would have been about 830,000 barrels per day — more than the amount of oil being imported to the United States from Russia. But it’s not as simple as substituting one source for the other. The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. Nor would producers be obligated to sell that entire amount to the U.S. We rate the statement Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: 53% of Americans made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story would have changed their vote in 2020.\n",
            "[Evidences]:At a recent House subcommittee meeting, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., tried to make the case that if stories about a laptop belonging to President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, were more widely publicized, more people would have changed their votes in the 2020 election. \"According to polling, of the people that were made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story, 53% would have changed their vote, including 61% of Democrats,\" Stefanik said. \"This is the definition of election meddling.\" Stefanik tweeted a video of her speaking at the meeting, and wrote: \"53% of Americans made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story would have changed their vote in 2020.\" Her claim was shared on Truth Social by former President Donald Trump. Biden won with 51% of the popular vote, so we were curious about a claim that 53% percent of informed voters would have switched their votes. Congressional Republicans want to heighten public awareness of the laptop’s contents, which include personal and professional materials belonging to Hunter Biden. The GOP is also investigating business dealings by Biden family members and social media companies’ policies, saying they suppress conservative viewpoints. Stefanik represents New York state’s North Country and is House Republican conference chairman, part of the House’s GOP leadership team. The laptop was left at a Delaware computer repair shop, and some of the laptop’s contents were reported by the New York Post in October 2020, weeks before the presidential election. The laptop story was suspected to be Russian-planted disinformation, but subsequent reporting shows that does not appear to be the case. Twitter blocked users from sharing the story. Executives at the tech giant now say that was done in error. Since the 2020 election, news organizations such as CBS News, The New York Times and The Washington Post have independently verified at least some of the laptop’s contents. This timeline of events has upset conservatives, who argue that the suppression cost Trump the election. TIPP Insights, which describes itself as a \"right-leaning polling outfit,\" conducted a poll Dec. 7 to Dec. 9, 2022, more than two years after the election, asking people about the laptop story. Stefanik’s claim comes from this poll, said her spokesperson, Palmer Brigham. TIPP Insights, which has been lauded for correctly predicting elections, started with a pool of 1,351 survey respondents and asked them whether they were following the laptop story. Respondents who said they were following the story — 37 percent, or 501 people — were then asked about the possibility that they would have voted differently in 2020 had they known the laptop was not disinformation. They were asked: \"How likely would knowing before the election that the laptop contents were real and not ‘disinformation’ have changed your voting decision?\" Stefanik’s claim — that 53% of people made aware of the laptop story would have changed their vote — adds together the 28% of respondents who said they were \"very likely\" to have changed their votes, and the 25% who said they were \"somewhat likely.\" Rounding out the pool were 17% who said they were \"not very likely,\" 25% who were \"not at all likely,\" and 6% who were \"unsure.\" But more Republicans had been following the story than Democrats. Among Republicans, 46% told pollsters they were following it closely or somewhat closely, 35% of Democrats said they were, and 34% of independents said they were. The smaller pool’s party affiliation was 37% Democratic, 36% Republican, and 26% independent. The latest Gallup survey on affiliation shows that nationally, 30% of people identify as Democrats, 27% identify as Republicans, and 40% call themselves independents. The original pool of respondents was 39% Democratic, 29% Republican, and 29% independent. Among the 137 people who said they were \"very likely\" to change their vote, 58 of them, or 42%, were Republicans. Were these people who voted for Biden in 2020? The poll doesn’t say, but it seems unlikely. Trump received support from 94% of Republicans who voted in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center. So, the result is illogical: If many members of this group were to change their vote because of the laptop story, they might well have changed their vote from Trump to Biden, which given the partisan nature of voting in 2020, wouldn’t make sense. We called the pollster, Raghavan Mayur, and asked, how could 53% of informed voters say they would switch their vote when Biden only won 51% of the popular vote? That could not be answered, because that would require further questions not included in the poll, Mayur told us. Were the voters who said they would switch their vote all Biden voters? Would they have switched to Trump? The poll can’t tell us. Mayur declined to comment on Stefanik’s claim. He noted the poll’s larger-than-usual margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points, because of its small sample size. (Margins of error get smaller as sample sizes get bigger.) We showed the poll to two polling experts. The questions leading up to the question about changing votes used right-leaning framing of the laptop issue, said G. Elliott Morris, author of the book \"Strength in Numbers: How Polls Work and Why We Need Them.\" He pointed to this question: \"If there was a concerted effort by the FBI, Intelligence Community, Democrat-controlled Congress, and Biden campaign, along with Big Tech, to frame the Biden laptop as ‘disinformation,’ do you agree or disagree the electorate did not have access to information that could have been critical to their decision at the polls?\" This framing primes respondents to answer subsequent questions in certain ways. It’s likely that when members of the already right-leaning group get the question about switching their votes, they’re thinking about how a prior question stated that President Biden and \"Big Tech\" hid information from them, priming them to say they are very or somewhat likely to switch their vote, Morris said. Using \"Democrat-controlled\" instead of \"Democratic\" is a longtime strategy by those on the right to downgrade their opponents. Joshua J. Dyck, a polling expert at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell read the poll, and said that at best, 19.6% of Americans said they would have changed their vote, based on the total sample size, the size of the subset of people who said they were following the story, and the 53% of that group who said they were very likely or somewhat likely to change their vote. \"Are these people saying they would change their vote to Biden?\" said Dyck, a professor and director of UMass Lowell’s Center for Public Opinion. \"Or are they engaging in expressive responding, by giving the answer which makes Biden look worse? It’s certainly the latter, but the poll is ill-equipped to tease out these discrepancies.\" Polls that ask people about what their behavior would have been two years before and that ask voters hypothetical questions do not produce useful information, Dyck added. \"Overall, I would conclude almost nothing about the effect of Biden’s laptop on the 2020 election from this poll other than that many Americans seem to be interested in this issue today, especially a large subset of informed Republicans,\" Dyck said. Stefanik claimed that \"53% of Americans made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story would have changed their vote in 2020.\" The poll found that of a group of people who had been following the story, 28% would have been \"very likely\" to change their vote had they known the laptop was not disinformation, and 25% were \"somewhat likely,\" a less-sure response than Stefanik’s claim implies. However, the pool of respondents who answered this question leans Republican more strongly than the general population, so most of these voters would not have been voting for Biden in the first place. This makes the polling result illogical: Understood literally, if many members of this group were to change their vote because of the laptop story, they might well have changed their vote from Trump to Biden. So her statement is not accurate. We rate this False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:In his response to the State of the Nation Address, Democratic Alliance parliamentary leader Mmusi Maimane made a number of claims about electricity, employment, land reform and crime. Here are the claims that readers asked us to investigate.ElectricityClaim “Our economy has lost R300-billion since 2008 because, without a stable electricity supply, manufacturers cannot produce, investors are driven away and jobs are lost.” Verdict mostly-correctEmploymentClaim “Despite all his past promises, what President Zuma failed to tell us last week was that, today, there are 1.6-million more South Africans without jobs than when he took office in 2009.” Verdict incorrect[Note: This section was corrected on 22 January 2016, but the verdict has stayed the same. An explanation of the correction is provided at the end of the report.]The figure of 1.6-million was calculated based on what they viewed as the broad unemployment rate, as released in Statistics South Africa’s Quarterly Labour Force Survey, Coetzee told Africa Check. This definition of employment includesboth unemployed people and discouraged job seekers.He provided a table showing the figures they had used from the survey, which compared data from April to June of 2009 (when Zuma took office) with October to December of 2014.This, Coetzee said, showed that the number of unemployed people increased by 1.67-million – from 5.64-million inthe second quarter of 2009to 7.31-million at theend of the 2014.However, while the DA used the right definition of broad unemployment (unemployed people plus discouraged job seekers) they used data from Stats SA’s calculation of people unemployed according to thenarrowdefinition.Instead they should have used Stats SA’s dataset on the number of people employed according to the broad unemployment definition. This shows that the number of unemployed people increased from6.68 million in April to June of 2009to8.1 million in October to December of 2014.Using the broad unemployment dataset, the number of unemployed people has therefore increased by by 1.42 million since Zuma took office, not 1.6-million as Maimane claimed.Land reformClaim “The 17.5 million hectares of fertile soil in communal land areas must be unlocked for reform purposes. State-owned land must be fully audited and used to fast-track redistribution to deserving beneficiaries.” Verdict incorrectCrimeClaim “But while our communities are being over-run by drug lords the President said nothing about crime! Where are the specialised anti-drug units? Drug crime has doubled since they were taken away.” Verdict incorrectThe Democratic Alliance obtained the R300-billion estimate from economist Dawie Roodt, chief economist at the Efficient Group , a JSE-listed financial services company.Maimane’s chief of staff, André Coetzee, told Africa Check: “We engaged with Roodt on the methodology underlying his assertions and were satisfied that they were sound. His office also provided the technical data on which the figures were calculated for our researchers to review.”Francois Stofberg, an economist at the Efficient Group, told Africa Check that they used different approaches in an attempt to “determine what the impact of a shortage of electricity supply is on the South African economy”. He explained that this included a “linear... forecast of economic growth before and after the electricity crisis”.“Using this method we found that the economy would have been 10% larger in 2013 [ when GDP stood at R3,400-billion ] without the black-outs that occurred during the latter parts of 2007. Note that this excludes the recent black-outs,” Stofberg said.He said that many other variables in the economy could have had a positive or negative effect on South Africa’s economic growth. These, he said, were difficult to quantify.“However, it is evident from our estimates that a shortage of electricity... had a significant impact on GDP. Our estimates were an attempt to quantify these impacts,” said Stofberg. He added that “[n]one of these approaches are without criticism”.The head of Wits University’s School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw, said that estimates like this would be influenced by the assumptions made by the economists.“Naturally other assumptions will give other results, but [the Efficient Group’s] assumptions are sound enough,” said Rossouw. Land reform numbers are tricky . Few accurate datasets exist and some of them are very outdated.Take the land utilisation data set that forms the basis of Maimane’s claim. Although still in use by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, it was compiled in 1991. (An updated version should be released towards the end of next year, said the department’s spokesman, Makenosi Maro.)The 1991 data showed that in the former apartheid-era homelands there were 2.5-million hectares of potentially arable land and 12-million ha of grazing land. Together with all other land uses – such as for nature conservation, forestry and towns – this amounted to 17.1-million hectares in total.To their credit, the DA admitted this large error. Coetzee said: “The reference to the full area as comprising fertile soil is erroneous in this context, however the need for tenure reform for the areas remaining under communal land tenure remains and would unlock massive agricultural potential for land reform beneficiaries.”But it is a fallacy to think there are millions of hectares of state land ready to be redistributed, said Alex Dubb, a researcher at the University of the Western Cape’s Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS). Dubb helped compile a factsheet on state land available for redistribution based on 2002 data and their calculations then showed that only 675,449 ha could possibly be redistributed.In the meantime a state land audit has been carried out and government is busy registering all its properties uncovered during the process with the Deeds Office. Once this has been carried out, we will have a much better picture of how much state land is available for redistribution and how much municipal land is available as commonage to poor households.IncorrectAndré Coetzee, Maimane’s chief of staff, told Africa Check that “anti-drug units were disbanded in 2004, and drug-related crime has more than doubled between 2004 and 2013”.He said this was based on the 2013 Crime Statistics released by the South African Police Service.According to the South African Police Service, reported drug-related crime has tripled since 2004. The latest crime statistics show that there were 84,001 cases in 2004/05 and 260,732 cases in 2013/14.The drug-related crime ratio increased 2.7 times over the same period from 180.3 cases per 100,000 people in 2004/05 to 492.1 cases per 100,000 people in 2013/14. Ratios allow for crime levels to be accurately compared between different years in which population sizes vary.But an increase in the reported number of drug-related crimes does not automatically mean that these crimes are on the rise. A factsheet prepared by the Institute for Security Studies for Africa Check noted that “[c]rimes such as the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, drug-related crime and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs are detected during police action such as roadblocks and search and seizure operations. This means that these crimes will increase if there is an increase in police activity.”Additional reporting by Anim van Wyk\n",

            "[Evidences]:Democrats are still celebrating over Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch from Republican to Democrat — and are mocking the Republicans about it. Their latest Web ad is a spoof of the television showSurvivor, showing a parade of Republican leaders and asking, \"Which one will win the battle for the heart and soul of the GOP?\" The ad was inspired by an op-ed that Republican moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine wrote for theNew York Times,lamenting what she sees as the Republican Party's hostile attitude to moderates. \"It is true that being a Republican moderate sometimes feels like being a cast member ofSurvivor— you are presented with multiple challenges, and you often get the distinct feeling that you’re no longer welcome in the tribe,\" Snowe wrote. \"But it is truly a dangerous signal that a Republican senator of nearly three decades no longer felt able to remain in the party.\" The DNC's ad starts with that quote, then shows a parade of Republican leaders identified by their first names. There's Mitt (Romney, former governor of Massachusetts); John B. (John Boehner, the House minority leader); Sarah (Palin, the governor of Alaska); Karl (Rove, political adviser to George W. Bush) and more. The ad concludes with Rush Limbaugh. The video is really just an effort to mock Republican leaders. But one checkable fact stood out to us: \"21 percent party ID and shrinking,\" meaning that the GOP now has only 21 percent of the electorate, and that figure is declining. To find out the facts, we have to turn to polls for how people cited their party because some states don't require voters to declare an affiliation. Two nonpartisan polling organizations, the Gallup Polls and Pew Research Center for People and the Press, released polling data on party identification close to the same time the DNC ad was released. Gallup found 28 percent identified as Republicans, while Pew counted it at 23 percent. To broaden the picture, we turned to the Web site Pollster.com The site creates data models that aggregate many polls, with an eye toward more accurate results. The site lists an NBC poll at 20 percent and one from the Associated Press at 18 percent, but most are above the 21 percent cited by the Democrats. Using the range numbers, Pollster.com calculated an overall estimate of 26.4 percent. So the Democrats are cherry-picking the low end. The next question is whether Republican registrations are declining. The ad doesn't give a time frame. Both the Gallup and Pew polls show declines since roughly 2005. Gallup has recorded a decline in Republican Party identification from about 35 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2009. Pew showed a decline from 30 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2009. During similar time frames, Democrats have seen small upticks or been flat. Pew showed independents increasing from 30 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2009. So the DNC is right that the number of voters identifying themselves as Republicans has been declining. But 21 percent is from the low end of accepted estimates. So we rate their statement Mostly True.\n",

Padilla has filed bills on divorce and same-sex unions but not any measure on polygamy for the general public. Sec. 3, Art. 27 of Presidential Decree No. 1983 of 1977, a code of Filipino Muslim laws, states that a Muslim man can have more than one wife but not more than four wives as long as he can provide equal companionship and just treatment to all. The fabricated graphic posted by FB page So kaylan moko e crucrush back (created on April 16) garnered over 16,166 interactions.

            "[Evidences]:The Covid-19 pandemic, along with disrupting normal life, has led to the postponement of several global sporting events, including the Olympics, scheduled to be held in Tokyo this year. In this context, a video showing colourful and beautifully synchronised firew orks lighting up the sky in wonderful patterns is being widely shared on social media. It is being said that these fireworks were initially supposed to be displayed during the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics 2020. But after it was postponed till next year, they were displayed under Mount Fuji in Japan as the fireworks could not be stored for a long time. The caption along with the video says, “Tokyo Olympic FIreworks. WOW! This is AWESOME! The fireworks were prepared in Tokyo for the opening ceremony of this year's Olympic Games, because COVID-19 could not open the Olympic Games, but the fireworks and firecrackers could not be stored until 2021, so the fireworks of the Olympic Games were displayed at this time. Please enjoy the Olympic fireworks set off under the beautiful Mount Fuji.” WATCH THE VIDEO HERE India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The video being shared is old and was created digitally. Some fireworks, however, were reported in parts of Japan to mark a year before the Olympics. The archived version of the post can be seen here. A number of users on Facebook have shared the same claim as can be seen here, here and here. The claim is viral on Twitter as well. Some such claims can be here (https://twitter.com/ lawrencebing/status/ 1294138463923535873) and here (https://twitter.com/ Welikumbura/status/ 1294292682206900225). “Gulf News” and “MSN” websites had published articles based on this claim. AFWA probe We noticed that in the comment section of one such post, some people raised questions about the authenticity of this video. When we reverse-searched the keyframes of the viral video using the InVID tool, we found that it was shared in 2015 on a YouTube channel. It was shared with the caption, “FWsim Mount Fuji Synchronized Fireworks Show2”. We found that Fwsim is a website where anybody can create fireworks display videos of their choice. On YouTube, there are a lot of videos created with this method. However, we also found an article by “The Japan Times” which states that on July 24, fireworks were set off at different places in the country to mark a year before the Olympics. “Boomlive” had also debunked this claim earlier. Thus, it can be concluded that though fireworks were set off in Japan in July, the viral video being shared in this context is neither recent nor does it show actual fireworks. It was created using a simulation website. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Fireworks meant to be displayed at the opening ceremony of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were set off recently under Mount Fuji in Japan as they could not be stored till next year. Conclusion This video is at least five years old. The fireworks seen here are not real ones but were created digitally. However, some fireworks were reported from different places in Japan to mark a year before the Olympics.

            "[Evidences]:In defending President Obama's plan to reduce tax deductions for high earners, the White House has said the tax code is tilted toward rich guys. They've understated the case considerably. We'll explain how in a bit. First, some background: The issue arose when Obama proposed reducing the percentage of charitable contributions that taxpayers who earn more than $250,000 can take as a tax deduction, from 35 to 28 percent. That would raise about $318 billion toward Obama's proposed $634 billion \"reserve fund\" to be used to reform health care, according to Obama's budget proposal. Critics, including some Republicans and nonprofit executives, don't like the idea. At a White House news briefing, Jake Tapper of ABC News said the proposal was controversial and asked White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, \"Are you willing to consider a different revenue stream than that tax increase to fund health care?\" \"Well, I do think all issues are on the table,\" Gibbs replied. \"Let's, though, just discuss the — I assume you're talking about the charitable contribution — I mean, a middle-class family donates a dollar to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax. The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration.\" Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument inthis blog post. Let's walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes. If you donate $1 to charity, you can list that as a deduction, meaning you can subtract $1 from your income before calculating your taxes. High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about $350,000. So if they subtract $1 from their taxable income, their tax burden drops by 35 percent of $1, which is 35 cents. By contrast, couples with taxable income between $16,700 and $67,900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent. If they make that same $1 contribution, and subtract the $1 from their income, their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of $1, or 15 cents. Gibbs' point rests on the contention that couples making between $16,700 and $67,900 are middle class, which we believe is fair — the median household income in the U.S. is$50,233. So Gibbs was right, except that he understated the case. Here's how: First, you can't take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes. Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so, while rich folks are very likely to. Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004, but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers, according to theUrban Institute. We're not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case, because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize, and he confined his comment to the income tax. It's worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes — a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent, and an estate tax on top of that. But it's also true that a charitable contribution of, say, $1,000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle-class person's income than a high earner's. That's all academic though. The bottom line is that Gibbs' number are accurate. We find this claim to be True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share “This is striking: 50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K — & now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away.” — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in a tweet, Oct. 12, 2017 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight With House passage of a budget blueprint on Oct. 26 that could open the door to $1.5 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts over 10 years, congressional Republicans presumably will soon unveil details of how they plan to reshape the tax code. One item high on the list: repealing the deduction for state and local taxes, known in the tax trade as the SALT deduction. We’ve written a primer on this deduction, exploring the dubious claim about whether red low-tax states are subsidizing blue high-tax states. This tweet by Pelosi has been sitting in our inbox for a while, after a reader expressed concern about it. Advertisement Pelosi, at a news conference before the House vote, asserted the pending tax bill was “an assault on the middle class, an assault on state and local tax deductions. And I bring this up because it affects everyone.” She ticked off the average deduction for some individual states, such as: “If you live in Virginia, same thing, a million and a half people are affected. … If you live in Virginia, the average deduction is over $11,000.” Let’s explore Pelosi’s spin. The Facts Every taxpayer has a choice of taking either a standard deduction or to itemize deductions, which in addition to state and local (and property) taxes can include mortgage interest payments, charitable contributions and medical expenses above a certain threshold. For most people, especially those who do not own their homes, the standard deduction is larger than itemized deductions — and the Trump administration proposes to boost the standard deduction (but eliminate personal and dependent exemptions). Advertisement Currently, about 30 percent of tax filers opt for the itemized deduction — and virtually all of them take the SALT deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. Pelosi frames the SALT deduction as a middle-class tax break. But it’s really wealthier Americans who benefit. With itemized deductions, the value of the deduction increases as you move into a higher tax bracket. So $1,000 in deductions would be worth almost $400 to someone in the highest tax bracket but only $250 for a taxpayer in the 25 percent tax bracket. In justifying her figure that 50 percent of American who claimed the SALT deduction make less than $100,000, her staff pointed to a table in a report produced by the Government Finance Officers Association arguing for keeping the deduction intact. The table, which is based on 2015 Statistics of Income (SOI) data from the IRS, is reproduced below. You can see that 53 percent of the people claiming the deduction make less than $100,000. [Mea culpa, we misread read the chart. The correct figure is 54 percent.] But that’s not the whole story. Look at the last column, which shows the percentage of the deduction received by various income levels. Taxpayers making less than $100,000 may comprise 53 percent of the tax filers, but they get less than 25 percent of the deductions. Tax filers making more than $100,000 get more than 75 percent. Advertisement As we have explained before (see the video above), most taxes are paid by the wealthiest Americans, so it follows that most of the benefits of tax deductions would also flow to wealthy Americans. There is another table in the report that demonstrates this. This shows how huge the average SALT deduction is for people making more than $500,000 — and how much their taxes would increase if the deduction were repealed. (As we have noted before, the alternative minimum tax takes away the SALT deduction from many wealthy taxpayers but most taxpayers who are hit with the AMT still benefit from the deduction. Republicans have also proposed to eliminate the AMT.) This brings us to Pelosi’s statement about the average deduction in various states. We highlighted her comment about Virginia — an average of above $11,000. The problem with an average is that it gets inflated by the big numbers for a few people. We’d rather use a median, though it’s difficult to calculate precisely and we could not find an expert who had done so. However, the Tax Policy Center does produce a state-by-state breakdown of income ranges. Advertisement When you calculate the average deduction for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) below $100,000 — who were highlighted in Pelosi’s tweet — that’s an average tax deduction of about $5,000. That’s much less than the average she touted at her news conference. Indeed, the administration argues that many people in the lower tax brackets will abandon itemizing tax deductions because the increased standard deduction will make up for it. Meanwhile, the average tax deduction for Virginians with an AGI above $100,000 is nearly $18,000. This chart by the Committee for a Responsible Budget, drawn from 2013 Congressional Budget Office data, demonstrates how the benefits of the SALT deduction are tilted toward the wealthy. The top 20 percent is roughly tax filers making above $100,000, though it varies according to household size. “There are millions and millions of hard-working households across America that are at risk of losing a deduction that is a really big deal in terms of their family budget,” said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman. “Eliminating the state and local tax deduction has very serious consequences that create very serious pain in the lives of millions of American families. Dismissing the consequences that will be felt by the majority of families who have come to rely on this tax deduction does a disservice to the debate.” The Pinocchio Test This is a good example of how tax data can be manipulated. Pelosi is usually eager to point out that wealthy Americans will mostly benefit from broad-based tax cuts. In this case, wealthier Americans would mainly feel the effects of a broad-based elimination of a tax break. Advertisement But in this case, Pelosi chooses to ignore the distributional tables and instead focus on the absolute number of people affected, even if the impact is mostly felt by the rich.

            "[Evidences]:The United States must have a prepared military, but it’s not unpatriotic to say the country is spending too much money on its defense, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker.How much money? It’s more than the military spending of up to the next 12 countries combined, the Democratic mayor said.Booker made that point on the Feb. 1 episode of HBO’s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" during a panel discussion about the recent Senate hearing on Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be U.S. Defense Secretary.\"The reality is we have to make sure that we have a military that’s prepared, but right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined, and we’ve got to start realizing that we can secure and protect ourselves, but also be responsible in the way that we do that,\" Booker said.\"And it’s not unpatriotic to say that we’re spending too much money,\" the mayor added. \"In fact, to me, that’s the patriotic thing to say.\"Booker’s claim is on target: The United States spent more on defense in 2011 than the combined total of other high-spending nations, according to data from two organizations considered to be leading authorities on worldwide military spending.The first set of figures comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for 172 countries.In 2011 -- the most recent year available -- the United States led the world in military spending at $711 billion, marking 41 percent of the world total, according to the institute. The next top 12 spending nations accounted for a combined total of $670.9 billion, according to the institute.U.S. expenditures were nearly five times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $143 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place with estimated spending of $71.9 billion.We found similar results when we reviewed the data released by The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank which tracks military spending in 170 countries for its annual \"Military Balance\" report.According to IISS figures released last year, the United States’ defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, making it the largest in the world. The combined total of the next top 9 nations was $486.7 billion, according to IISS figures.Referring to U.S. military spending, Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, explained in an e-mail: \"It is large because we have overseas interests all over the world, and we put a high premium on responsiveness and qualitative superiority.\"But the United States is poised to restrain its defense expenditures in the coming years.In addition to reduced costs from winding down the war in Afghanistan, the Budget Control Act of 2011 contains provisions that limit spending increases in defense and other areas over the next decade.It’s worth noting that calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no single definition of what constitutes military spending.As the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute points out on its website, \"the lack of sufficiently detailed data makes it difficult to apply a common definition of military expenditure on a worldwide basis.\"Our rulingIn a panel discussion on HBO’s \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Booker claimed that \"right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined.\"The mayor’s statement is accurate, according to data from two leading authorities on worldwide military spending. One set of figures shows that, in 2011, military spending by the United States exceeded the combined total of the next 12 highest nations by roughly $40 billion.We rate the statement True.

            "claim [Claim]: The Buffett Rule \"will bring in less than $5 billion per year. ... Enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The U.S. Senate voted on the eve of Tax Day to reject the so-called \"Buffett Rule\" ensuring a minimum tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, but that didn't put the matter to rest. Democrats, who pushed the legislation, and Republicans, who blocked it, both believe that continued debate about taxes works to their advantage.That debate includes the Paying a Fair Share Act, which was named the Buffett Rule for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. The bill would impose a 30 percent minimum tax on those whose individual adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million a year.Democrats say the legislation is about fairness and shared sacrifice to reduce the budget deficit.Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, a director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, highlighted Republican criticism in a commentary for Politico on the day of the Senate vote.He called the Buffett Rule a political gimmick and a distraction from real tax reform with little impact of consequence.\"For all the political chest-thumping surrounding this proposal,\" he said of the the Buffett Rule, \"the new tax will bring in less than $5 billion per year. That represents 0.4 percent of annual individual income taxes paid — or enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt.\"PolitiFact Ohio had seen similar dismissals of the proposal, including the claim that it \"raises virtually no money,\" but Portman's statement was weightier and more detailed. We asked his office how he backed it up. Press secretary Christine Mangi ran through the proof:On March 20, 2012, Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan body that estimates tax changes for lawmakers -- released a score of the Buffett Rule projecting $46.7 billion in additional revenue over 10 years, or $4.7 billion per year on average.Individual income tax receipts in 2011 totaled $1.09 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and $4.7 billion is 0.4 percent of that.The March 2012 CBO baseline of net interest spending in fiscal 2012 is $224 billion, which comes to $4.3 billion per week.The annual revenue of the Buffett Rule -- $4.7 billion -- would pay that one week’s interest.We followed the steps, checked the sources and confirmed the accuracy of Portman's figures.We also found that there is more worth knowing.In projecting future revenue from the Buffett Rule, the Joint Committee on Taxation followed its standard practice of using a \"current law\" estimate, which assumes that temporary tax cuts or increases take effect as planned under current law.Under the current law baseline, the so-called Bush tax cuts, which were extended in 2010, would expire at the end of this year. That scenario that would result in hundreds of billions in additional revenue from taxpayers, and the $47 billion would be on top of that.A \"current policy\" estimate, on the other hand, refers to what the revenue numbers would look like if the current rules continued -- if Congress again extends the Bush tax cuts, as it is generally expected to do.The current policy estimate says that if the Bush tax cuts are extended, then the Buffet rule would raise $160 billion over 10 years, or $16 billion a year. That's more than three times as much revenue as the current law estimate.In relative terms, it is still a small fraction of the amount needed to achieve deficit reduction.\"On the other hand,\" Washington Post policy columnist Ezra Klein observed, \"any deficit-reduction package is made up of lots and lots of smaller policies that contribute to the bottom-line figure\" -- noting that a proposal last year to defund public broadcasting for budget reasons \"packed about one one-hundredth the deficit reduction of the Buffett Rule.\"Finally, in framing the value of the Buffett Rule, we note that there is a difference between deficit and debt. The deficit is the amount by which the government's spending exceeds its revenues in a year. The budget deficit for fiscal 2012 is more than $1.3 trillion.The debt -- the figure used by Portman -- sets a much higher bar. It is the sum of yearly deficits and is the total amount that the U.S. government owes. The current total debt figure is $15.6 trillion.Portman’s statement on the amount the Buffett Rule would raise and how that compares to interest on the national debt is accurate.On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome, also known as SADS, has been studied for years. The syndrome is caused by an undetected genetic heart condition and often occurs in young adulthood. But ever since COVID-19 vaccines were released in late 2020, people have continually suggested that the shots are making SADS more common. Articles and social media posts have highlighted instances of young athletes collapsing during games, with claims that the rate of these occurrences are way up since the vaccines came to market. Take this Instagram post: \"SADS — according to International Olympic Committee data, an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffer sudden death per year from 1966-2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are a number of issues here. First: the data itself. While the study that the post described as \"International Olympic Committee data\" only reflects sudden deaths, the 769 figure it is being compared with incorporates deaths and cardiac arrest episodes that did not result in death. PolitiFact’s review of some of the reports that were counted in that figure also found the number included reports of cases that didn’t involve any emergency medical episodes at all. Second, the study that the Instagram post said looked at sudden cardiac deaths in athletes from 1966 to 2004 wasn’t, as it suggested, conducted by the International Olympic Committee. Rather, the findings were presented at a Dec. 7, 2004, committee meeting by researchers affiliated with the University Hospital Center in Lausanne, Switzerland. We were unable to get in touch with researchers involved in that study for more details or updated figures, and the International Olympic Committee told us that it doesn’t track this kind of data. The 769 figure, meanwhile, comes from an April 2022 segment on One America News Network, a conservative cable news service that in the past has shared problematic claims related to COVID-19. In the clip, reporter Pearson Sharp talked about how tennis players Jannik Sinner and Paula Badosa had to drop out of the Miami Open in 2021. Sharp then said the women were just two of \"more than 769 athletes who have collapsed during a game on the field over the last year from March of 2021 to March of this year.\" However, Sinner and Badosa did not collapse during any match. Tennis officials confirmed that Sinner was suffering from foot blisters and Badosa had a viral illness at the time. We reached out to Sharp about the data he used to get the figure. He told us the deaths and injuries were taken directly from headlines collected over the past year from around the world and sent several examples. But PolitiFact — and others — have repeatedly investigated the incidents cited in these claims. The details of these episodes show that vaccines are neither causing athletes to collapse, nor are they connected to other sudden death episodes. A review of the articles Sharp sent over also showed that the reports aren’t consistent. Some cite medical professionals who ruled out vaccination as a cause. Others don’t include any information on the athlete’s vaccination status. And some were about athletes that neither collapsed nor experienced a cardiac event. One of the examples is Gilbert Kwemoi, a Gold medalist middle-distance runner from Kenya who collapsed in his home and died in August 2021. None of the reports about his death that we reviewed indicate whether he was vaccinated against COVID-19 or if it was a cardiac event that caused his death. His brother told news outlets that Kwemoi had developed an \"illness\" at a training camp. Another is French soccer player Franck Berrier, who died of a heart attack in August 2021 while playing tennis. But Berrier, before the vaccines were on the market, had acknowledged that he had a heart condition. Berrier was quoted in 2019 to have said that his heart was only working \"at 70%\" \"There is no danger in day-to-day life,\" Berrier said, \"but if I put too much strain on it there's the risk that blood won't be pumped in fast enough and I'll have a heart attack.\" Sharp cited stories about the deaths of Ahmed Amin, an Egyptian soccer player, and Avi Barot, an Indian cricketer. But they make no mention of whether the men received a vaccine, or what their causes of death were. Sharp also pointed to the case of Kjeld Nuis, a Dutch speed skater. Nuis briefly developed pericarditis after receiving Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine but he didn’t collapse during any sporting event and he didn’t say whether his vaccination contributed to his heart problem or whether it was linked to his athletic activity. After experiencing some flu-like symptoms and chest pressure, Nuis said he was examined by his sports doctor and cardiologist. \"Was immediately able to go the next day and after a heart film, ultrasound and an MRI. Everything seems to be fine! Now at training camp,\" the skater said on his Instagram page. Another popular example in claims like the one on Instagram is the collapse of Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen. But Eriksen, according to his team director, wasn’t vaccinated for COVID-19 when he suffered cardiac arrest during a match in June 2021. \"To date, I am not aware of a single COVID vaccine-related cardiac complication in professional sports,\" Matthew Martinez, a sports cardiologist who works with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Soccer and who is the director of sports cardiology at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey told us in December. Martinez reaffirmed that observation when we reached out to him again in June. The same goes for Jonathan Kim, an associate professor of medicine and chief of sports cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta. \"I am not aware of any reports that vaccines in athletes are causing cardiac issues,\" he said. Studies and scientific reviews found no association between vaccination and deaths in anyone — adults or children — except in rare cases, according to a 2015 study. More recently, following the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, a 2021 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found no increased risk for death among those vaccinated for COVID-19. According to the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes Foundation, SADS conditions are genetic heart problems that can cause sudden death in young, apparently healthy, people. Warning signs of SADS conditions include family history of sudden, unexplained death under age 40, fainting or seizure during exercise, excitement or startle, and consistent or unusual chest pain and/or shortness of breath during exercise, the SADS foundation said. These conditions have been studied for decades, and the foundation told PolitiFact that there is \"no evidence\" suggesting that any of the COVID-19 vaccines cause people to develop SADS conditions, or make people’s conditions more severe. Dr. Michael J. Ackerman, director of the Long QT Syndrome Clinic and professor of medicine, pediatrics and molecular pharmacology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine said there is not a \"single signal\" of increased SADS events among diagnosed and treated patients who’ve been vaccinated. \"Over two years into the pandemic, there’s been no indication in the largest programs in the world of an increase in death from these conditions,\" Ackerman said. An Instagram post claims that an average of 29 young athletes suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004, while 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest from March 2021 to March 2022, suggesting the COVID-19 vaccines have caused a spike in sudden deaths. A study published in 2006 found that an average of 29 young athletes experienced sudden deaths over a nearly 40-year span, but there is no comparable study to weigh it against. The 769 figure is based on a collection of articles that incorporate reports of athlete deaths, cardiac arrest incidents and various incomplete anecdotes that didn’t involve any emergency medical episodes or have any confirmed connection to the vaccines. Studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and sudden deaths, and officials with the SADS foundation, as well as sports cardiologists, say there is no evidence that suggests any of the COVID-19 vaccines cause people to experience sudden death.

            "[Evidences]:When president Uhuru Kenyatta delivered his state of the nation address on 30 November 2021, he didn't correct some inaccuracies Africa Check identified in his Mashujaa Day speech a month before. Any Kenyan president is required to give a proper assessment of the state of the country each year. In this extensive report, we examine 15 claims in the address. We have again asked the president's office for the source of the data. On 30 November Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta addressed a joint sitting of parliament on the state of the nation, as required by law . In his speech Kenyatta focused on the post-pandemic economy. He also claimed achievements in building roads, schools, electrification, healthcare and more. Did he get all his facts right? We took a closer look at 15 key claims he made, some recycled from his Mashujaa – Heroes' – Day speech on 20 October, despite Africa Check having found them to be incorrect or misleading . We have asked the president's office for the sources of the data used in the speech and will update this report when we hear back. \"While most economies in the world shrank, Kenya's economy grew at 0.3%,\" Kenyatta said . He called this \"positive\" – if \"minimal\" – growth. It's a claim he also made on Mashujaa Day. Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics d irected us to the most recent economic survey for reliable data on growth. It was published in September 2021. The survey says Kenya's economy shrank by 0.3% in 2020 . World Bank data shows the same 0.3% contraction . And in a speech launching the survey, Kenyatta's finance minister Ukur Yatani also said the economy was \"estimated to have contracted by 0.3% in 2020\". Yatani attributed this to lockdown-related restrictions and a reduced demand for goods and services. – Makinia Juma The national statistics office has the data to check this claim, John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership thinktank told Africa Check. The data agency publishes quarterly gross domestic product reports, most recently in October 2021. This shows that Kenya's GDP at market prices grew by 10.1% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2020. Uhuru Kenyatta delivers 2021 state of the nation address. CITIZEN TV SCREENGRAB The 10.1% is not \" real GDP \", as the president claimed. It's nominal GDP at market prices, unadjusted for inflation. Not taking inflation into account tends to distort the value of an economy. \"The problem with the president's statement is that we are missing the context,\" Kinuthia said. \"The 'phenomenal growth' was because we are comparing it to a period when the economy was locked down.\" In the second quarter of 2020, Kenya's economy shrank by -5.7%. This was mainly due to restrictive measures aimed at countering Covid-19. Because of their unprecedented nature, a sharp recovery would be expected when these measures were eased, as noted by the statistics office. Prof Charles Wheelan is a senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the US and author of Naked Statistics , among other works. \"This is not a sign of robust new economic growth. It is a sign of recovery,\" he told Africa Check. \"It's not like getting a big raise at work. It's more like being unemployed for a spell and then getting your old job back. It's good – clearly better than the alternative – but not a huge sign of progress.\" The president was right that the economy grew by a higher than normal pace of 10.1% in the second quarter, but he left out important context. We therefore rate his claim as misleading. (Find out more about how we rate claims .) – Alphonce Shiundu Data from the statistics bureau shows that the 10.1% growth in the second quarter of 2020 was the highest of any quarter in two decades – since 2000. We asked the bureau's director-general Macdonald Obudho if there was earlier data. He said there wasn't. \"We do not have any data before that time. We were not generating quarterly GDP data before,\" Obudho said. Kenya gained independence in 1963 , almost six decades ago. But the available quarterly GDP data only goes back to 2000. We can therefore only rate the claim as unproven. – Alphonce Shiundu For historical data, the International Budget Partnership 's Kinuthia directed us to the world development indicators , a World Bank database covering 217 economies – 189 member countries and 28 \"other\" economies. The data shows that Kenya's economy grew by 22% in 1971 and 17% in 1972. The 10.1% rise in the second quarter of 2020 is therefore not \"the first time\" the country has had double-digit economic growth. And Dartmouth College's Wheelan explained that \"double digit growth\" usually means \"GDP growth (stripped of inflation) of 10% a year\". He added: \"The government can credibly say that the economy appears to be undergoing a robust recovery. It's a stretch for them to say they are delivering double-digit rates of growth as that phrase typically is used in a context that suggests policies or developments that are permanently raising the productive capacity of a country, not merely bouncing back after a shock.\" We rate the claim as incorrect. – Alphonce Shiundu In his delivered speech , Kenyatta said the rise was from 180 to 651 beds. But the text version gives it as from 108 beds. Before the pandemic, he said , there was only an average of two ICU beds in each of Kenya's 47 counties. We checked this exact claim in the president's Mashujaa Day speech and found it to be unproven. Read our detailed findings as to why his numbers still do not add up. – Makinia Juma Kenya's statistics bureau gives figures on the country's power situation in its yearly economic surveys. The figures come from the electricity utility Kenya Power and the power-generating company KenGen . The 2014 economic survey says the country had 1,717.8 megawatts of total installed capacity in 2013, not 1,300 MW. Similarly, Kenya Power data shows that on 30 June 2013, two months after Kenyatta was sworn in, installed capacity was at 1,765 MW . The president understated the electricity available in 2013 by more than 400 MW. The grid capacity was closest to the president's claim in 2009, when it was at 1,311 MW . This was four years before he took office. – Alphonce Shiundu In 2020, the country's installed capacity was 2,836.7 MW, according to the statistics bureau's most recent economic survey , released in September 2021. Available electricity has increased by 1,118.9 MW since 2013. This is a 65% rise, close to two thirds. Capacity has not doubled. We also checked Kenya Power's most recent report . This showed that on 30 June 2021, Kenya had 2,984 MW in its grid. The increase from June 2013 to June 2021 is 1,219 MW or 69%. There's no evidence that installed capacity has doubled since 2013. – Alphonce Shiundu The increase from 2013 to 2021, according to Kenya Power's most recent data is 1266.2 MW, an average increase of 158.3 MW a year. For Kenyatta's administration to have installed 325 MW every year for eight years, the total increase would have had to be 2,600 MW. We rate the claim as incorrect. – Alphonce Shiundu Kenya Power says it supplies electricity to \"individual households, private industries, companies and government institutions\". Its 2013 report shows there were a total of 2,330,962 customers connected to electricity. But only 2.1 million were domestic customers, or households. That means about 200,000 were other customers. Kenyatta equates the total customer base to household connections. This gives a misleading picture of households' access to electricity in 2013. – Makinia Juma Has the Kenyatta administration tripled the number of households connected to electricity? We sifted through Kenya Power's annual reports, and found the numbers in the table below. Kenya Power customers 2013-2021 Year Total customers Domestic customers Increase in domestic customers 2012/13 2,330,962 2,059,340 2013/14 2,767,983 2,481,856 422,516 2014/15 3,611,904 3,305,934 824,078 2015/16 4,890,373 4,565,907 1,259,973 2016/17 6,182,282 5,839,865 1,273,958 2017/18 6,761,090 6,404,632 564,767 2018/19 7,067,861 6,682,137 277,505 2019/20 7,576,145 7,156,429 474,292 2020/21 8,278,203 7,852,051 695,622 5,792,711 Source: Kenya Powe r The increase in domestic customers from 2012/13 to 2020/21 adds up to 5.79 million – not 6.3 million. The number of households connected to Kenya Power's grid did almost triple under Kenyatta's administration. But the president overstates the increase by about 500,000. His claim is exaggerated. – Makinia Juma The increase from 2013 to 2021 , according to the most recent data, is 5.79 million – an average of 726,589 a year. This works out to 1,990 connections a day since 2013, when Kenyatta's administration came to power. The claim is mostly correct. – Makinia Juma Kenya's constitution provides for the equitable sharing of money between the national government and the 47 counties. The counties became operational after elections in March 2013. These units of government should receive \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. \"The 15% is the minimum that has to be sent to the counties but, the principle is, the allocations to counties should cover the devolved functions,\" the International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia told us. The Commission on Revenue Allocation assesses the cost of county functions and recommends how funds are shared between national and county government. The recommendations are either adopted or changed by the Division of Revenue Act , if approved by Kenya's parliament . The allocations from 2013 to 2021 are in the table below. ALLOCATIONS TO KENYA COUNTIES 2013-2021 Year Equitable share (KSh billion) (%) of most recent revenues audited and approved by parliament Year of most recent audited revenues 2013/14 190 27.9% 2011/12 2014/15 226.7 43% 2009/10 2015/16 259.8 33% 2012/13 2016/17 280.3 30% 2013/14 2017 / 18 302 32% 2013/14 2018/19 314 33.6% 2013/14 2019/20 316.5 30.5% 2014/15 2020/21 316.5 23.3% 2016/17 Source: Division of Revenue Acts from the National Council for Legal Reporting Going by the equitable shares, the average county allocation over the eight financial years for which allocations have been made works out to 31.6% of the most recent audited revenues. But the \"most recent audited and approved revenues\" are at least three financial years behind, giving a misleading picture – the percentage allocation looks rosy, but the actual amount is low, Kinuthia said. Ideally, the revenues from the previous financial year should be audited and approved by the national assembly in time for the next budget, but this has not happened. The president's numbers may appear correct, but they only give a partial picture. He omits the context of the 15% as a minimum, the role of the CRA in costing the functions before the sharing is done, and the fact that there's at least a three-year lag between the allocations and the most-recent audited and approved revenues. In the end, it paints a misleading picture. – Alphonce Shiundu Kenyatta said the country's taxman – the Kenya Revenue Authority – had collected KSh10.8 trillion since 2013. He added that the amount was \"equivalent to Kenya's GDP\". We checked the authority's data for total revenue collected since 2013. Financial year Revenue collected (trillion Kenyan shillings) 2013/14 0.96 2014/15 1.1 2015/16 1.21 2016/17 1.37 2017/18 1.44 2018/19 1.58 2019/20 1.61 2020/21 1.67 Total tax revenue 2013/14 to 2020/21 10.83 Source: Kenya Revenue Authority . Numbers rounded off. Kenya's GDP was KSh10.8 trillion in 2020/21, according to the statistics bureau. The World Bank's figure is KSh10.5 trillion for 2020. Available data indicates that the Kenya Revenue Authority did collect KSh10.8 trillion in the eight financial years from 2013/14 to 2020/21. The amount is equivalent to the country's GDP in 2020. We rate the claim as correct. – Makinia Juma The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. Kenyatta made the same claim on Mashujaa Day. But when we fact-checked it, we found it to be incorrect. Our report explains why. What data there is shows that while the ratio has improved over the eight years of the president's term, it was at its highest in 2018. There's also no \"prescribed\" United Nations \"standard\" for a policing ratio. Experts have previously told Africa Check that such a recommendation would have little meaning, given countries' significant differences in police functions and capabilities, and the security challenges they face. Instead, the quality of policing is a better indicator. – Makinia Juma Kenyatta said the Kenya Meat Commission , the state-owned meat processor, has an outlet that \"collects KSh1 million\" every day after the military controversially took over its management. The military had turned it around, he said. The KSh1 million a day translated to an average of KSh30 million a month, he said . But is it KSh3.6 billion a year? Here's the maths. Multiplying KSh30 million (one month average) by 12 (months in a year) comes to KSh360 million, not KSh3.6 billion. The president's figure is 10 times off the mark. – Alphonce Shiundu\n",

            "[Evidences]:Flu season isn’t quite here yet, but myths about the vaccine are already starting to spread on social media like a, well, virus. A Facebook post, shared on Oct. 12, claims that for the two weeks after you receive a flu shot you’re an \"active, live walking virus:\" \"Folks who get flu shots please have some respect and courtesy and stay home for minimal [sic] of 2 weeks while you are an active live walking virus. Also don’t hug others and give kisses and please immediately tell others you were vaccinated so they don’t come close to you.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is a common myth. So common, in fact, that a 2015 study published in Vaccine found that 43% of the public believed that getting the flu vaccine can give you the flu. But the shot does not contain an active virus and an inactivated virus cannot transmit infection. The myth is at the top of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s \"Misconceptions about Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines\" list. The organization says: \"No, flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu viruses that have been ‘inactivated’ (killed) and that therefore are not infectious, or b) using only a single gene from a flu virus (as opposed to the full virus) in order to produce an immune response without causing infection. This is the case for recombinant influenza vaccines.\" Another CDC flu fact sheet also notes that while the nasal spray flu vaccine does contain a live virus, \"the viruses are changed so that they cannot give you the flu.\" (More about this \"change\" below.) Harvard Medical School tackled the superstition in a breakdown of flu myths and says that since it takes around two weeks to get protection from the vaccine, people who get sick before then wrongly assume the shot gave them the flu. \"The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus that can't transmit infection. So people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the flu shot caused their illness.\" William Schaffner, a professor and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, also confirmed to PolitiFact that the claim is a myth. \"The injectable flu vaccine is composed of selected parts of the influenza virus and cannot re-assemble itself into the complete virus in the human body. Thus, it is impossible for the flu vaccine to cause influenza,\" Schaffner wrote in an email. \"The nasal spray influenza vaccine is a ‘tamed’ flu virus. It can multiply in the nose where it stimulates the body to provide protection, but it is biologically incapable of multiplying down in the lungs or anywhere else in the body. It also cannot cause the person who has received the vaccine to experience influenza.\" Besides contracting the flu within the window before the vaccine takes effect, people may also experience other side effects such as pain, redness or swelling near the injection site; headache, fever, nausea and sore muscles. \"After receiving the injectable vaccine everyone experiences a sore arm for a few hours. In very few persons this can last a day. Some also have a bit of swelling or redness at the injection site,\" Schaffner wrote. \"Only 1% - 2% of persons experience a slight fever that can last a day or so. The nasal spray vaccine can be associated with a runny nose or a scratchy throat for a day or two. These brief symptoms are just minor reactions to the vaccine.\" The only viral thing about this claim is the claim itself. We rate it Pants on Fire!\n",

            "[Evidences]:In an Aug. 11, 2016 tweet that was augmented with a bit of animation (a counter with rolling numbers), House Speaker Paul Ryan declared: \"President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon.\" That’s a flat declaration of a specific figure. Let’s see if it’s on the money. Ryan’s evidence To back Ryan’s statement, his office cited a February 2016 article from MarketWatch.com, which reported on Obama’s proposal for a $10 tax on each barrel of oil to pay for \"clean\" transportation projects such as expanding mass transit. The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years. To be clear, the article said the proposal \"isn’t expected to go far.\" And in a news release Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is \"dead on arrival in Congress.\" The MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: \"This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it’s clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb.\" So, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst’s estimate. But it’s only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax. What the oil companies would do isn’t quite as certain as what Ryan claimed. A trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, warned the tax would \"harm consumers.\" But it hedged a bit in saying the tax \"could\" raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. Economist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at 22 cents, the Huffington Post said 22 to 24 cents, and the Washington Post said 24 cents. Politico and Forbes said about 25 cents. One note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. But that’s a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies. Our rating Ryan said: \"President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon.\" Estimates are in the 24 cents range for the $10-per-barrel tax that Obama proposed on oil companies. But it’s not a sure thing, if the tax became law, that all of the tax would be passed onto consumers. We rate the statement Mostly True.\n",

This nine-year-old account has posted over 20,000 tweets till now. Therefore, it can be concluded that reports of France rejecting visas and deporting Pakistanis following Imran Khan's comments on Macron is misleading. However, a European Member of Parliament from France recently called Pakistan \"the leaders of fake passports and fake documents\". INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Tourist visas of 183 Pak citizens were rejected by France after Imran Khan criticised Macron's comments on Islam. Some 118 Pak citizens with proper papers, including a former ISI chief's sister, were deported forcefully. Conclusion The tweet posted by \"@PakConsulateFr\" is an imposter account of the Pakistani embassy in France. The original Twitter handle is \"@PakinFrance\".

            "[Evidences]:A Facebook (FB) Reel currently circulating among thousands of netizens falsely implies that Metro Manila has been placed under a heightened alert level to combat COVID-19 transmission. The misleading Reel used an old news report.On May 2, an FB user reposted a short video originally published by TikTok user @niwrenewstv. It was captioned \"#alertlevel3\" and carried a 24-second clip featuring a 24 Oras news report where broadcast journalist Vicky Morales said the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) had placed Metro Manila under Alert Level 3 on Monday.The report was aired not recently but on Dec. 31, 2021.The excerpt in the circulating Reel even showed a news ticker stating that the new alert level status would cover Metro Manila from Jan. 3 to 15, 2022. The area was placed under Alert Level 3 at the time due to local transmission of the then-emerging Omicron variant of the virus.As of May 11, Metro Manila remains under Alert Level 1.Some criticized the publisher of the misleading Reel for spreading disinformation while others fell for it and in anger, accused the government of \"taking advantage\" of the people.This erroneous video emerged a week after the Department of Health reported the first case of infection with the Arcturus variant, detected in Western Visayas. The patient was asymptomatic and has already recovered, according to news reports.The FB netizen's video has garnered over 5,300 reactions, 300 comments, 1,200 shares and 684,000 views.

            "[Evidences]:A wide range of reputable sources over the years have shared a photograph of two women purportedly receiving a golf lesson from a robot trainer. The BBC,for instance, shared the image in a 2015 article about artificial intelligence: MashableandCNNalso used this image to illustrate articles about the history (and future) of robotics. Although this image has been featured by a number of credible sources, only a few scant sentences accompanied it in each instance: CNN: An early prototype robot was used to assist two women golfers with their swings in this 1925 picture. Mashable: A robotic trainer coaches golfers on their swings. BBC: Two golfers use a golf robot trainer to help with their golf swing in 1932. Outside of these single-sentence descriptions, we couldn’t find any information about a robot golf instructor from the 1930s. Rather, it appears that this image was taken on the set of the 1930 filmLove in the Rough. The confusion likely stemmed from a miscaptioned Getty Images photograph that was included in the gallery “In focus: Looking for the perfect golf swing?” That iteration was captioned: “Two golfers use a golf robot trainer to help with their golf swing.” However, Getty Images also included this photograph in the gallery “Classic Entertainment: Bestsellers From Moviepix 1930s” with a caption identifying one of the women in the photograph as actress Penny Singleton: American actressPenny Singleton(1908 – 2003) (known as Dorothy McNulty in the early part of her career) (right) and another actress take lessons on their golf swings from a mechanical instructor in a scene from the musical comedy ‘Love in the Rough,’ directed by Charles Reisner, 1930. The photograph does appear to show actress Penny Singleton and her co-star Dorothy Jordan,on the set ofLove In The Rough: Other apparent stills from the movie show Singleton in the same outfit. We also found two other photographs(one of which was again miscaptioned by Getty as “young couple plays golf”) of this “robot golf instructor” featuring the film’s male star Robert Montgomery: We only found one image of this robot golf instructor from a different location. Again, however, this image appears to show Love in the RoughactressPenny Singleton: Footage of the mechanical golfing robot in action was included in a video titled “Vintage Wack Inventions” that was posted to YouTube byFilmArchivesNYCin February 2012. Again, however, it appears that this robot golfer was erroneously included in a montage of real-world (not cinematic) inventions. The clip can be seen at the 6:20 mark of the following video: We reached out to F.I.L.M. Archive for more information about this footage and the United States Golf Association for any details concerning robot golf instructors from the 1930s but have yet to hear back from either organization. The viral image was likely taken on the set of the 1930 movie Love in the Rough. Whether or not this robot actually provided golf lessons, however, has yet to be determined.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Social media posts claim to show a public health poster from the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic that echoes COVID-19 safety guidelines -- wear a mask, wash hands, keep a \"safe distance\" from others. But the image text has been altered; the original version was used in a 1919 Red Cross Christmas campaign to fight tuberculosis, and it did not contain such instructions. The image on the poster shows three people, one a child, huddled together beneath a Christmas wreath as a man strains against a door to keep out a ghoulish white spirit. The words \"the next to go\" appear in red at the top. Also Read: No, Nuremberg Code Does Not Put Mandating Masks As A 'War Crime' \"Wear a mask and wash your hands! Avoid touching your face. Maintain a safe distance from others,\" says the bottom of the poster, which appeared on Facebook on December 22, 2021. Screenshot of a Facebook post, taken on January 4, 2022 \"1918 SPANISH FLU PANDEMIC POSTER 102 YEARS AGO. STILL RELEVANT TODAY!\" said another Facebook post with the image. The posts come as the United States is experiencing \"almost a vertical increase\" in COVID-19 cases as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps the country following the holiday season. Wearing a face mask, social distancing, and frequent hand washing are all measures recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop the spread of coronavirus. A Google reverse image search yielded the same illustration as the social media posts, but with a different message. Also Read: 'Flurona' Is A Case Of Simultaneous Infections, Not A Coronavirus Variant The US National Library of Medicine website includes an archive of a poster with the same picture, titled: \"The Next to Go: Fight Tuberculosis.\" Rather than a call for masks and social distancing, the text below the illustration reads: \"Fight Tuberculosis, Red Cross Christmas Seal Campaign.\" Screenshot of an image on the US National Library of Medicine website, taken on January 3, 2022 The description for the print says: \"This 1919 poster from the Red Cross promised that tuberculosis would be 'The Next to Go.' The illustration shows the protector of the family pushing the dreaded visitor out the door. \" The reverse image search also led to a result on the Philadelphia Museum of Art website. The print matches the one on the National Library of Medicine site. In January 2021, AFP consulted with Margaret Huang, an archivist with the Philadelphia Museum of Art, to confirm the true poster message. \"Since it seems this was a mass-produced poster, there is not an original per se,\" she said, but the Philadelphia Museum has a copy, as do the Library of Congress, McKee Library, and the National Library of Medicine. \"All of them have the text that ours does,\" she said. Also Read: Outdated Report Shared To Claim COVID-19 Booster Jabs Are Dangerous Indeed, the Red Cross website says the organization participated for 12 years in a Christmas program to fight the disease in the early 20th century, \"raising more than $15 million to combat tuberculosis, one of the world's deadliest killers at the time.\" AFP Fact Check has debunked more inaccurate claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic here.

            "[Evidences]:National conservative talkers hailed Gov. Scott Walker as a \"rock star\" and a \"genuine hero\" after the Republican won his third statewide election in a row -- the latest coming two years after Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin handily. On Nov. 7, 2014, Walker told one of those fans, syndicated TV and radio host Sean Hannity, that he did it despite Obama’s pre-election visit to Milwaukee’s central city. \"The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there,\" Walker said of Democrats. Before the details of Walker’s win begins to fade away, let’s check his claim that Obama couldn’t boost the Democratic turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 election, in which Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke. On Oct. 28, 2014, Obama joined Burke, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee at North Division High School in the heart of the city’s predominantly African-American north side. The rally for Burke drew an overflow crowd estimated at 3,500, and Obama lightheartedly pleaded with attendees to back Burke. \"Grab your friends, and grab your coworkers, and grab the lazy cousin who’s sitting at home, never votes during the midterm elections,\" the president said. \"He’s watching reruns of old Packer games. Just grab him up. Take all of them to cast their ballot, and cast their ballot for Mary Burke.\" The high school is a voting site (Ward 143) on Election Day, and Walker was right that in the 2012 presidential race Obama won 99 percent in that ward amid turnout that -- following historical patterns -- was larger than in non-presidential years. The crowd at North Division was the biggest of the campaign season for either side and appeared to energize Democrats, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. But on Election Day, did Obama’s urging work? Digging into the claim Walker didn’t specify what election he was comparing to the turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 contest. It could have been the 2012 presidential race. Turnout then was much higher compared to the 2014 governor’s race. But the most logical starting point is the most recent governor’s race. That would be the June 2012 special election, prompted by the recall drive that followed Walker’s surprise move to sharply curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. Walker seemed to be focused specifically on that one ward. And, indeed, turnout in Ward 143 was down 9 percent from June 2012. If you look at city turnout overall, it’s the same story. In June 2012, turnout topped 73% of pre-registered Milwaukee voters, reflecting the intensity of a race that riveted the state for months. More than 223,000 Milwaukeeans voted in that race, with three-fourths backing Barrett. The tally of those in Milwaukee who voted Democratic in the recall race was 171,150. In the 2014 Walker-Burke race, that number fell to 156,167. What if you go back to the 2010 governor’s race, which also pitted Barrett and Walker? That was the last regularly scheduled governor’s race, so the dynamics are more comparable. The results are mixed. Ward 143 (then known as Ward 109, before maps were redrawn after 2010) produced a higher Democratic vote for governor in 2010 than in 2014. So, by that measure Walker is on the money. But the citywide Democratic turnout in 2014 the turnout was higher than that in 2010. Burke drew 13 percent more Milwaukee votes in 2014 than Barrett did in 2010. Our rating Walker said: \"The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there.\" The numbers back him up: turnout in that ward -- and citywide was down, and so were the votes for Democrats in 2014 when compared to the most recent governor’s race, the 2012 recall. Turnout also was down in that ward compared to the 2010 turnout in Walker’s first race, though citywide it was higher in 2014 than four years earlier. We rate his claim True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A video has been doing rounds on social media the last few years showing a phone exploding after receiving a call from a the number ‘777888999’. The video also consists of what seems like footage from a hospital, where a boy with a bloody jaw is lying on a stretcher, and a clipped version of ABP Live video. The video ends with a man saying that he received a call from 777888999 but he did not respond as he knew what could happen. The claim being shared with it says that the number has virus in it and causes phones to blast when the call is received. A user uploaded this video on the Alt News app to check the veracity of the claim. Fact-check The video is a part of a hoax that has travelled through time only to become more elaborate with the crux of the message remaining unchanged. However, careful analysis of the claims raised via the clip is enough to debunk the false rumour. 1. The number ‘777888999’ is a 9-digit number. Mobile phone numbers in India consist of 10 digits. The call also couldn’t have been from an international number because it does not have a country code. 2. If one performs a keyword search of the video on YouTube, one finds that it has been circulated using varied claims like the man’s mouth exploded due to an e-cigarette. 3. Alt News broke down the video into multiple frames using InVID and reverse-searched an image of the clip showing a man with a bloody jaw. The clip was debunked by Brazilian fact-checking website E-Farsas in 2016. E-Farsas claimed that the man was actually trying to commit suicide by placing an explosive in his mouth. The website claimed that the incident took place in 2014. Alt News could not independently confirm the same as the sources used by E-Farsas are no longer accessible. 4. We found that the ABP Live clip used in the video was part of a December 2016 Viral Sach broadcast where the news channel was not reporting on the “virus” but debunking the hoax. The length of the complete broadcast is 5 minutes and ABP Live starts the fact-check after 2:40 minutes into the program. This part has been clipped out and only the portion where ABP Live talks about the message warning people to not receive calls from ‘777888999’ has been included in the video. This was an attempt to mislead social media users into believing that the “death number” is real since it has been reported in the media. A clip from the video is juxtaposed with the original ABP Live video below to show the similarities. Thus, an over 4-minute video was manufactured by morphing bits and pieces from different videos to make a false claim that cell phones were exploding upon receiving a call from the number ‘777888999’ Donate to Alt News!

So you can kill thousands of people and go to jail for 30 days. They catch a drug dealer, they don’t even put him in jail. … Think of it: You kill 5,000 people with drugs, because you’re smuggling them in and you’re making a lot of money and people are dying, and they don’t even put you in jail, they don’t do anything. But you might get 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.” — Trump, remarks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, March 10 What is the president talking about? Advertisement Are there drug dealers who kill “2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people” and get off with just 30 days in jail? The math seems a little fantastical, so we decided to check it out. The Facts We consulted a number of experts on the illegal drug market, and the president’s comments left them scratching their heads. No state, not even California or Ohio, has more than 5,000 overdose deaths in a single year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mark A.R. Kleiman of New York University offered some very rough numbers. “Cannabis aside, the total drug markets in the U.S. at retail probably generate $50 billion a year in illicit revenue,” he said. If the average dealer earned $50,000 a year (which is way high, since most dealers are small-scale retailers, many of them supporting their own habits), that would suggest something like 1 million full-time equivalent dealers. There are less than 100,000 total drug overdose deaths, which would be less than one-tenth of a death per dealer per year on average.” Advertisement When we dug into specific drugs — such as heroin — Trump’s claim still did not add up. There are 1 million heroin users in the United States, and about 2,000 dealers are arrested each year. The number of heroin deaths is about 12,000 a year. Even if one assumes there were twice as many dealers as those arrested — a very low-ball assumption — that would only be three people per dealer a year. Killing your clients is probably not a good long-term business proposition, but there has been an uptick in deaths related to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, that has been mixed in with heroin to give it a stronger kick. White House officials suggested we were looking at this too closely at the ground level. Instead, when Trump refers to “dealers,” he’s apparently talking about the people at the top of the pyramid. Advertisement As an example, we were directed to a case in Knoxville, Tenn., where a grand jury in January accused seven people, including two who fled to Italy, of running a drug trafficking conspiracy to distribute oxycodone, oxymorphone and morphine through pain management clinics between 2009 and 2015. The indictment says about 700 patients “are now dead and a significant percentage of those deaths, directly or indirectly, were the result of overdosing on narcotics prescribed” by Urgent Care & Surgery Center Enterprise, the defendants’ company. The death toll attributed to the enterprise is said to still be climbing. Still, even a “significant percentage” of 700, or twice that, is not going to get you to 2,000 or above. The indictment also said that investigators had charged an additional 30 narcotics traffickers and 80 to 90 small narcotic distributors. It’s hard to parse out exactly how many deaths each person would be responsible for, unless you pin all of the deaths on the top of the pyramid. Advertisement Moreover, the illicit drug markets are so fluid — and dealers so replaceable — that whoever is taken off the streets by law enforcement is quickly replaced. Even more problematic is Trump’s claim that someone who has killed “thousands” would end up in jail for just 30 or so days. He appears to be mixing up small-time dealers with kingpins. “A retail cocaine dealer who gets arrested with a small amount and pleads to a possession charge might well get a few months in jail,” Kleiman said. “Since those people are utterly replaceable, it’s really not worth locking them up, except for the minority who commit violent acts in connection with their dealing.” The big dealers usually face harsh prison terms. For instance, on March 21, two days after one of the president’s statements, the two leaders of a New Mexico drug trafficking organization were sentenced to 10-year prison terms for methamphetamine trafficking, heroin trafficking and money laundering offenses. Advertisement According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in 2017 the average sentence for drug trafficking was 66 months — and about 96 percent of drug-trafficking offenders were sentenced to prison. The Pinocchio Test The president asserted: “You can kill thousands of people and go to jail for 30 days.” Once again, the president ends up in Four-Pinocchio territory because of the way he frames his rhetoric. He may have a point that “kingpin” drug dealers are responsible for at least hundreds of deaths. But then he cannot turn around and say they only end up with 30 or so days in prison if they are caught. A handful of drug dealers might get by with a little prison time, but those are the small fry, not the people responsible for many deaths.

            "[Evidences]:On 6 October 2018, a Twitter user with the handle “@lookitsSammm” posted the following message to her 297 followers: The tweet was posted the same day Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Kavanaugh’s contentious nomination was thrown into partisan chaos when three women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct during his high school and college years. Kavanaugh denied all allegations in Senate Judiciary Committee hearings that were punctuated by protests and sharply-divided public opinion. Although the tweet and the account to which it was posted have both been deleted, cached versions were still viewable as of 9 October 2018, as were numerous angry responses in what became an Internet firestorm. Social media users posted screen captures of the message and also an image of a woman and name they claimed to be the one responsible for authoring the tweet: No arrests have been made and no person has been officially identified by authorities in connection with the tweet, but the person who posted it was employed by Intermediate School District 917 in Rosemount, Minnesota, as a paraprofessional. That person voluntarily resigned after being placed on administrative leave as a result of the post, according to Superintendent Mark Zuzek: On Sunday, October 7, 2018, the district began receiving complaints regarding an employee. The actions of the employee did not occur at school, and there were no school devices, equipment, or other school staff involved in the actions. At no time were students or staff in danger. The employee was placed on paid administrative leave and an investigation conducted. The Dakota County Sheriff’s Office posted a statement declaring that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was aware of the post and would follow up as necessary, while local television station WCCO reported the FBI was investigating the matter: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is also aware of the incident and will follow up as appropriate. Please contact District Superintendent Mark Zuzek at 651-423-8229 for further questions relating to the school district’s involvement in the matter.

            "claim [Claim]: \"When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:If he wins the presidency, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker says he will fight to deliver tougher gun control laws. In an interview on ABC This Week, the senator from New Jersey pointed to what he said was the success of a gun licensing law in Connecticut. \"When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%,\" he said. \"These are things that have been tried and done and that work.\" We found that he correctly cited two studies, but experts said more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions. Booker was referring to two different studies about the effects of a 1995 Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license. The law was passed after a series of gang shootings in 1993 and 1994 claimed dozens of lives. One study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2015 examined the impact of the Connecticut law on subsequent homicides. (Researchers were from Johns Hopkins as well as University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco.) Under the law, a prospective handgun buyer had to clear an application process that included a background check to obtain a license. The buyer also had to apply for a permit with local police. The law also raised the legal age to buy a handgun from age 18 to 21, and it required applicants to undergo at least eight hours of gun safety training. Researchers found the \"permit to purchase\" law was associated with a 40%reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. The reduction amounted to 296 lives. They determined this by comparing Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law went into effect to rates that would have been expected if the law had never passed. Researchers used comparison data from other 39 states that did not have a similar law. Researchers also discovered the large drop in homicides was found only in gun-related killings, not homicides caused by other means, which suggests the law was the driving force behind the reduction. The other paper, which appeared in Preventative Medicine, examined the effects of two opposing state measures on suicide rates. In addition to the Connecticut law, Johns Hopkins researchers looked at a 2007 repeal of a 1921 Missouri law that had required anyone who wanted to buy a handgun to obtain a permit from the sheriff’s office. Using similar methods as the homicide study, the researchers calculated the cumulative percent change in firearm suicides during the post-law change periods for Connecticut (1996–2005) and Missouri (2008–2012). They found a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's law. Missouri's repeal of its law was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Daniel Webster, an author of both studies and gun researcher at Johns Hopkins, said it is impossible to determine with certainty causal connections of the effects of the law. However, researchers used the best available data and forecasted what would have happened to Connecticut’s homicide and suicide rates had the state never implemented such a law, he said. Webster said there is debate among researchers whether one should forecast counterfactuals— what would have happened without the law, in this case — for a longer period than 10 years. While generally more data are better in research studies, too many years of data can make it harder to determine the impact of a law in some cases. However, Webster said that he has extended his research to look at the impact of Connecticut’s gun law through 2017 and found that the trend of the impact of the law continued. Researchers plan to submit their findings to a journal. While other experts have cited the Johns Hopkins studies, the RAND Corporation in a 2018 review of studies found the effects of licensing and permitting on homicides and suicides inconclusive. (RAND examined thousands of studies about the effects of various types of firearm laws in various places.) RAND doesn’t consider studies about a single state to show a causal effect that can be generalized to the United States population. \"These particular studies are well-conducted and useful, but are not scientifically definitive,\" Terry Schell, senior behavioral scientist at RAND, told PolitiFact. However, RAND’s \"inconclusive\" finding should not be treated as evidence that there is no true effect of the Connecticut policy or that Johns Hopkins findings were wrong, Schell said. RAND’s finding only concludes that more research — for example, in different states or using different methods — is needed. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, explained it to us this way: the Johns Hopkins studies are strong but they are not definitive proof of the impact of these laws. \"There is a strong belief that licensing is one of those crucial things if you want to get a handle on trying to reduce gun violence,\" he said. That’s different from other types of research that have been replicated multiple times, such as showing that seat belts help keep passengers safe. Booker said, \"When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%.\" Booker is correctly citing research by Johns Hopkins University. Researchers found that Connecticut’s 1995 law was associated with a 40% reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. In a separate paper, researchers found a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with the law. However, more research is needed on the topic to draw further conclusions.

            "claim [Claim]: “Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day.”\n",
            "[Evidences]:It took all day and then some for Milwaukee election officials to count their mountain of absentee ballots in the 2020 presidential election And those 170,000 votes proved decisive. When the ballots were added to the state total about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, Wisconsin swung from a lead for President Donald Trump to a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden. A later canvass and recount confirmed Biden won the state by about 21,000 votes. But the swing and timing sparked an avalanche of misinformation, with Trump and an array of other Republicans claiming there was something nefarious about the late arrival of Milwaukee’s votes. Of course that’s ridiculous: We’ve noted in multiple False and Pants on Fire ratings that the absentee votes from Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold, were long expected to heavily favor Biden and to come in late. The controversy stems from limitations in state law on when election workers can process absentee votes — limitations that were unchanged despite the massive increase in this kind of voting amid the pandemic. State Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, raised this point in a letter to the state’s Republican legislative leaders, seeking a bipartisan task force to improve Wisconsin’s voting system. \"Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day,\" Carpenter said in the Dec. 11, 2020, news release. \"Allowing this simple change would stop the false accusation that tens of thousands of ballots are secretly being dumped after midnight changing the outcome of the election. We all know our current process and know that is not true. It is just a matter our laws requiring workers to wait until 7:00 AM on Election Day to begin tabulating.\" Is Carpenter right that Wisconsin law handcuffs election officials in a way most states don’t? The short answer is yes. The longer answer depends a bit on how you define processing. The National Conference of State Legislatures compiled details on how each state handled absentee ballots for the 2020 election. Their research showed many states limit counting of absentee votes to Election Day — about 30 in all. But few go as far as Wisconsin in not allowing any ballot processing until that day. Only Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming require that ballots not be processed until Election Day. (Michigan requires smaller cities to wait until Election Day, while those with 25,000 or more people can start a day early.) The timelines vary among the other states, with some allowing ballots to be processed as soon as they are received, while others begin the process a set amount of time before Election Day. A New York Times breakdown of when states are allowed to begin \"pre-processing\" ballots — defined as verifying signatures, opening envelopes and flattening ballots to get them ready for tabulation — shortened that list further, showing only Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin limiting this to Election Day. We saw dramatically different vote reporting dynamics in states that allow this earlier ballot processing. In North Carolina, for example, where absentee votes can be processed five weeks before the election and counted two weeks before, an early lead for Biden turned into a Trump win as in-person votes were added to the tallies later in the day. Carpenter said Wisconsin is one of the few states that don’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day. However we define that processing, it’s clear Wisconsin in the extreme minority. Just a handful of states ban election workers from beginning work on absentee ballots before Election Day. We rate this claim True.\n",

Fact-check A lot of social media users claimed that the viral image is not recent but was instead taken in 2017 in Ranchi. Upon further research, Alt News found that the image was taken during the Garib Kalyan Mela which was held on September 16, 2017 in Ranchi. Amit Shah and Pooja Singhal were both present at the event and they were pictured wearing identical attires as is seen in the viral image. (Amit Shah and Pooja Singhal can also be seen together from 29:34 in the video below.) There are several images from the Garib Kalyan Mela 2017 on Getty Images. Alt News compared stills from the event and the viral image. This slideshow requires JavaScript. It can be observed that both the individuals are wearing identical attires as seen in the viral image. Hence it is evident that an old picture of Amit Shah and IAS officer Pooja Singhal from the Garib Kalyan Mela 2017 was circulated with the false claim that it was taken recently, days before several locations linked to IAS officer Singhal were raised by the ED in a money laundering case, and cash worth Rs 19.31 crores was recovered.

            "[Evidences]:Monday night 11/14/2011 at Lambeau Field This is what ESPN failed to show you Monday night, 11/14/2011. Apparently, they thought their commercials were more important than showing this scene for about 5 seconds. On the evening of 14 November 2011, the NFL’s Green Bay Packers hosted the Minnesota Vikings in a football match-up held at Lambeau Field in Green Bay which was televised by ESPN as part of that network’s Monday Night Football schedule. As the previous Friday (11 November) had been Veterans Day, the Packers announced they would be staging a number of Veterans Day-themed events before the game and during halftime: The Green Bay Packers’ Monday night game against the Minnesota Vikings is dedicated to showing appreciation to the U.S. Military through a variety of activities in recognition of Veteran’s Day. Upon entering Lambeau Field fans will receive an American flag, compliments of the Wisconsin Army National Guard and Oshkosh Defense. Attendees will also take part in an in-stadium USAA card stunt to thank veterans and current military for their service. The USO of Wisconsin will be standing by with Oshkosh Defense in the parking lot to accept phone cards for the military. People can drop off phone calling cards to the USO reps at the Oshkosh Defense M-ATV, or can donate cash to be used to purchase cards for their “Operation Phone Home” efforts. If bringing cards, people are encouraged to get international cards, which provide the most reliable service for the military members. Other military-themed activities scheduled include a large on-field flag with stars representing all military branches during the national anthem, military shout-outs on TundraVision, and a halftime show featuring the Wisconsin National Guard 132nd Army Band and fireworks display. The Packers and WPS will also be recognizing and welcoming home 1st Lieutenant Infantry Officer Kent Gavin through Operation Fan Mail on-field prior to the national anthem. Gavin will be accompanied by his fiancée and her parents. The national anthem will be performed by Steel Magnolia’s Meghan Linsey and Joshua Scott Jones. Some of those activities, such as the pre-game card stunts in which the stadium crowd spelled out messages including “Thank You Veterans” and “Thank You Military” and the unfurling of a large flag on the field during the playing of the national anthem, were captured in the photographs displayed above and audience videos such as the following: Within days of the game, reports (such as the following account from Milwaukee television station WTMJ) began to trickle out expressing disappointment that only spectators present at the game had been able to view the pre-game Veterans Day tribute activities at Lambeau Field, as ESPN did not include them in their telecast: Packers fans inside Lambeau Field had a chance to take part in a special moment to honor America’s veterans before the Packers-Vikings game Monday night. Most of them raised a card to help form a pattern that said “Thank You Veterans” and American flags. However, most of the nation did not see the tribute, as ESPN-TV was taking a commercial break during the national anthem. We contacted ESPN to invite them to explain the circumstances behind why the tribute had not been aired, and they sent us the following response: We appreciate and applaud these entertainers for their hard work and talent, but exposure of them before games and at halftime can’t be guaranteed. Our pre-game and halftime features have proven to be very popular with our fans and they’ve come to depend on tuning into ESPN, The World’s Biggest Sports Fan, to catch up-to-date scores and sports news. This theme was played upon in a satirical 31 January 2012 Daily Spoof article which posited that the performance of the U.S. national anthem before the upcoming Super Bowl XLVI game would be pre-empted on television by a commercial for Dodge trucks: Football fans watching Super Bowl XLVI can remain seated during the pregame ceremonies this year, because the singing of The Star-Spangled Banner will be preempted by a television commercial for Dodge trucks. “At $7 million a minute, we can’t spare the time it takes for the National Anthem to be performed,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell explained. “And don’t try to accuse us of being unpatriotic here. No one’s a bigger fan of Belichick and Brady than I am. It’s just that the advertiser made us an offer we can’t refuse.” The sponsor of the ad, the Chrysler Corporation, is now owned by the Italian automaker Fiat. Some readers who encountered this article out of its original context took it seriously, but as noted in the article’s disclaimer, “The story above is a satire or parody. It is entirely fictitious.” One photograph typically included with this item was not taken on the date of the Veteran’s Day-themed events at Lambeau Field, but rather during the season-opening game two months earlier: \n",

            "[Evidences]:Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is pushing a proposal to cap the sizes of large banks. He appeared on ABC News' This Week with Jake Tapper to talk about that, as well as Democratic efforts to pass financial reform.\"Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake,\" Brown said. \"Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP. ... We've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.\"Some very smart people disagree on Brown's point that big banks resist regulation by reason of their sheer mass. People like Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, urge measures that would limit the size of the biggest banks. Meanwhile, people like Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning New York Times columnist, say that breaking up the banks isn't necessary to avert the next meltdown if the proper regulations are put in place. We were interested in Brown's statistic though: That 15 years ago the top six banks' assets totaled 17 percent of GDP, while today that's 63 percent.Brown's staff said he got the numbers from 13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown, a book by Johnson and James Kwak, that describes the financial crisis and advocates steps for reform, including limits on the size of banks. Johnson also cited the number in an article in the New Republic, co-written with Peter Boone, that criticized President Barack Obama for not pushing rules that are tougher on big banks.The numbers are a fairly straightforward calculation. You take the bank's total assets, such as loans, cash and securities. (Remember that to banks, a loan is an asset, since they make money off loans.) Then you divide by GDP, which is gross domestic product, and is the total economic output for a country during a given year. Last year, the U.S. gross domestic product was $14.3 trillion.Johnson's book lists the six biggest banks of 2009 as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.The numbers in the book looked right to us, but we wanted to find an outside expert to confirm it. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia agreed to run the numbers to see if they got the same thing.Sure enough, they found the same thing. The figures were off by afew percentage points because the researchers were able to use numbers from the fourth quarter of 2009 and compared them with the same quarter in 1994. Johnson's book cites numbers from the third quarter.Here's the information the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia sent us: Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 2009Bank of America Corp. - 2,224.5 JP Morgan Chase - 2,032.0 Citigroup - 1,856.6 Wells Fargo - 1,243.6 Goldman Sachs - 849.3 Morgan Stanley - 771.5 Total 8,977.5 Nominal GDP 14.453.8 Percentage 62.1% Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 1994Citicorp - 250.5 BankAmerica Corp. - 215.5 Chemical Banking Corp. - 171.4 Nationsbank Corp. - 169.6 JP Morgan - 154.9 Chase Manhattan - 114.0 Total 1,075.9 Nominal GDP 7,248.2 Percentage 14.8% A couple of experts we asked about these numbers noted that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were for years categorized as investment banks, and would not have been counted in the 1994 numbers. That changed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, when the two firms became bank holding companies so they could borrow from the Federal Reserve. The underlying point, though -- that there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry -- remains true, they said.Brown said, \"Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP.\" Independent sources and experts confirm that, so we rate his statement True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:\"In 2010, when the Conservatives took over, national debt was £0.95trillion. So they promised to reduce it and said we can trust them with the economy. But now it's £2.0trillion.\" Facebook post, 30 March 2019 These figures are not accurate, but they are in the right ballpark. In its first budget in June 2010, the Coalition government, led by the Conservatives, set a target for debt to be falling as a percentage of the size of the economy (GDP) by 2015/16. That target was missed, and debt on this measure has only started to fall in the last year. In May 2010, when the Coalition began, the national debt (excluding debt held by public sector banks) was £1.03 trillion. As of March 2019 it had risen to £1.80 trillion. You can also measure debt to include the debt held by public sector banks (those banks that were partially or wholly nationalised during the financial crisis). This measure isn't as commonly used, however, as it can distort the underlying figures . On this measure , debt has fallen from £2.3 trillion in May 2010 to £2.1 trillion in March 2019, because the debt attributable to those banks declined sharply as many of the government's holdings in them were sold back onto the open market . So the claim has close to the correct figure for May 2010 using debt excluding public sector banks, and close to the correct figure for the present day using debt including public sector banks. But they're obviously not comparable. Regardless, debt as a percentage of GDP is a better measure for making comparisons over time. Looked at this way, debt (excluding public sector banks) rose from 65% of GDP in May 2010 to a peak of 86% in September 2017, before falling back to 83% as of March 2019.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"In 1999 Lagos was generating N700 million in internally generated revenue per month.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Both APC office-bearers sought to talk up the APC's economic gains, particularly in Lagos state under former governor Bola Tinubu who is running for president in the February 2023 elections. But they exaggerated the growth of the Lagos economy under Tinubu's governorship and misled about the influence he had on revenue. Lagos state is not the third-largest economy in Africa. Numbers on inflation in the country and abroad were also fudged. Nigeria's election campaign season only officially begins 28 September 2022 , but political parties are already in top gear in the race to win over voters. President Muhammadu Buhari will step down after February 2023 elections, having first been elected on an All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket in 2015. The party has picked Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state and an influential APC member, as its new standard bearer. In two separate media appearances in August 2022, the APC made its case as to why it should be re-elected. First up was Kashim Shettima, who will be the vice president should the party win. Among the claims he made was that Tinubu improved the fortunes of Lagos so much that it was \"now the third largest economy in Africa\". Tinubu was governor from 1999 to 2007 and has remained influential in state politics. A day later, APC campaign spokesperson Festus Keyamo was on TV where he also talked up the records of both the party and Tinubu. Keyamo, who is the junior minister for labour and employment, challenged his host to fact-check him. So we did, by taking a look at eight claims from both appearances. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a commonly used measure of the size of an economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. Economists have told Africa Check that it is acceptable to compare the GDP of different geographical regions. The most recent data from the World Bank shows Nigeria's GDP was US$440.8 billion in 2021. This is the largest in Africa, a position Nigeria has held since 2013 when it \"rebased\" its GDP to more accurately capture economic activities. Lagos, with an estimated population of more than 15 million, is Nigeria's financial hub . But how big is its economy? The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) publishes quarterly GDP numbers. But they do not include figures for subnational regions like states. For this data, Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at NBS, referred us to the Lagos Bureau of Statistics . In a report on its website, the Lagos bureau gave the state's GDP as N26.6 trillion in 2021, having increased from N23.9 trillion in 2020. Nigeria's official exchange rate often varies . In 2021 it was between N379 and N413.9 to the US dollar. This works out to a GDP of between $64.2 billion and $70.2 billion. At least eight African countries recorded a GDP higher than this in 2021 . We therefore rate this claim as incorrect.  Shettima claimed that in 1999, when Tinubu took office, Lagos earned N700 million monthly as its own revenue, but this had now reached N50 billion. Internally generated revenue is defined as what states earn, independent of the funds they receive from Nigeria's federal government. NBS data on this indicator goes back to 2010, when Lagos generated N185.9 billion, or an average of N15.5 billion monthly. Using referencing clues from a 2014 journal paper that analysed internally generated revenue, we looked up statistical bulletin data from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Links for the 1999 and 2000 bulletins were broken. In 2001 Lagos earned N12.5 billion . This was the same figure as in a journal paper authored by two researchers working with the national assembly's research arm at the time. Their paper also gave internal revenue for Lagos as N11.6 billion in 2000 and N14.6 billion (or an average of N1.2 billion monthly) in 1999. This is at least N460 million a month more than claimed. By starting from a lower base, APC exaggerated the growth in internal revenue. The most recent data on the internal revenue of states published by the statistics bureau covered the first half of 2021. It showed Lagos generated the highest amount, N267.2 billion, or an average of N44.54 billion monthly. In December 2021, Lagos governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu , was quoted by the media saying the state has \"grown its internally generated revenue from N600 million monthly in 1999 to over N45 billion monthly as of today, an astounding increase of 7,400%.\" There is no evidence the state now generates an average revenue of N50 billion monthly. In his interview, Keyamo referred to Tinubu as \"a wealth creator\". Lagos governor Sanwo-Olu has credited Tinubu for starting revenue reforms in the state. But the size of the revenue and the increase in funds is not due to any single administration, Sheriffdeen Tella, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"Lagos has had good administrators as governors over the years but the increase in the state's revenue cannot solely be the result of the effort of any government or administration,\" he said. Tella said the natural location of Lagos near the sea and increased commerce due to the large population were some factors responsible for the increase in revenue. Successive governors had used the increased funds to expand the city, he added. We rate the claim misleading because it creates the impression the state's revenue increased only due to a single person's efforts. To support his point that Buhari's administration had run the economy well, Keyamo said Nigeria's economic woes should be viewed within the global context. He then claimed that the country's inflation rate had increased by only 5% between 2020 and 2022. But he seems to have mixed up a percentage point increase with a percentage increase . Keyamo said inflation moved from about 13% in 2020 to about 18% in 2022. The difference between these is five percentage points, not 5%. ( For more on this, read our guide to avoiding common statistical errors. ) Further, the data shows he compared two different indices. In 2020, the monthly year-on-year inflation rate varied from 12.13% in January to 12.56% in June and 15.75% in December. However, the 12-month average change in December 2020 was 13.25%, which he apparently referred to. For 2022, he referred to an 18.65% year-on-year change in June, while the 12-month average change for that same month was 16.54%. Minister Keyamo said Nigeria fared better than countries like the US, Canada and Spain when it came to managing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. \"Those countries are doing a seven to 10% increase in inflationary rate,\" he said . In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated 2020 annual inflation at 1.2% . In June 2022 it was at 9.1% , a sharp increase that has been widely reported on . The difference between 9.1% and 1.2% is 7.9 percentage points, and not 7.9%. That's not the only problem with this comparison. Tella, the economics professor, said some factors causing inflation were local and others global. \"It is not correct to compare inflation in Nigeria with that of the US and Canada,\" he told Africa Check. This was because those countries had not had the same level of currency devaluation as Nigeria. They also had the capacity to produce more of what they needed. \"But in Nigeria, we are mainly importing. We also import inflation .\" Tella also cited factors such as increasing interest rates and insecurity as local factors causing inflation. Flawed comparison Felix Onah is a professor of economics at Godfrey Okoye University in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria. He told Africa Check it was flawed to compare the average annual inflation rate to the monthly year-on-year inflation rate as they are computed using different methods. \"The basis for comparison is not there. The composition of the items that are taken into account in finding the level of inflation may not exactly be the same in Nigeria and the US for example,\" Onah said in response to our questions. \"The minister is part of the government. He is defending his constituency because no government will want to appear bad.\" A debt crisis is when a country cannot repay its debt. It occurs when revenue earned by the country is lower than its expenditure for a prolonged period. Thirty-nine African countries were included on a World Bank list of countries that were at risk or already in debt distress as of March 2022. 13 countries were classified as being at moderate risk of debt distress 18 were high risk Seven were already in distress Therefore, 25 African countries were at high risk or were already in debt distress. Nigeria was not on the list as Keyamo claimed – but this was only because the bank considered low-income countries. Nigeria is on the next rung, classified as a lower-middle-income country based on its gross national income (GNI) per capita . These countries have a GNI per capita of between $1,086 and $4,255 . 'GDP does not pay debts' Akpan Ekpo is a macroeconomics professor and a former director of the West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management . He warned that Nigeria's rising debt levels could be harmful. \"To assure Nigerians, the government says the debt to GDP ratio is within sustainable limits but GDP is just about the value of goods and services produced. GDP does not pay debts,\" Ekpo told Africa Check. \"What pays debt is revenue. Take a look at Nigeria's debt to revenue ratio and you will see that it is not sustainable. \"It is not bad to take loans. However, loans must be taken to fund projects that can ultimately repay the loans. Nigeria should not be taking loans to fund recurrent expenditure like salary and pension payments.\" In May, the World Bank approved a $150 million loan to the Lebanese government to import wheat and keep bread prices stable. While Nigeria has not borrowed to fund food imports like Lebanon, the government has received loans and grants to fund agricultural activities and enhance food security. An example is $500 million in World Bank funding to improve livestock production. In July 2022, the African Development Bank approved a $134 million loan for the Nigerian government to boost food production. In August, Nigeria's agriculture minister Mohammed Abubakar listed six projects funded by international organisations to improve agriculture. 'Nigeria cannot be said to have achieved food security' \"The definition of food security implies that a country has sufficient food supply for its citizens and the food must be generally agreed to be quality,\" Jonathan Alimba, a professor of agricultural economics at the Ebonyi State University in Abakaliki, southeastern Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"The food must also be affordable. So food security is hinged on three things: quality, availability and affordability.\" \"Nigeria cannot be said to have achieved food security. There are some instances where some food items are available in the market but citizens cannot afford them.\" There were also Nigerians who could afford food but not of the right quality based on the internationally recognised nutritional requirements for a child or an adult, Alimba said. Insecurity was also partly to blame. \"Farmers in some rural areas do not feel safe enough to go to the farms. If it isn't attacks by bandits and insurgents, it is by herdsmen. The failure to secure lives and property has affected the country's food production. \"To transport food produced from the north to the south is a problem. Food may be available in the north but it is a challenge to bring it down south where it is needed.\"\n",

            "[Evidences]:Netizens have revived a false Facebook (FB) post showing a “day-to-day” progression of symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the first nine days of infection, attributing the information to Singapore’s Ministry of Health. It also gave a list of food and health practices it said can fight the disease. This is misleading. The four-month-old FB status is wrong. COVID-19 symptoms are not the same for everyone. A look at the Singaporean Health ministry’s website, its most recent health advisory to the public, and its dedicated COVID-19 Symptom Checker site does not show any such list. Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 vary during the onset of the illness, said the United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They can also appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the March 17 post’s claims that a person will develop fever on the fourth day of infection and chest pressure on the eighth day, both the U.S. CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) say patients may experience a range of symptoms, the most common of which are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. “Less common” symptoms are “aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, and loss of taste or smell,” among others, while only about one in five COVID-19 patients develop more severe symptoms such as difficulty in breathing. Additionally, some COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or do not develop symptoms at all, while some are presymptomatic, or can be contagious even though their symptoms show up at a later stage after infection. Most of the items listed in the latter part of the FB post as measures to fight COVID-19 have also been fact-checked in the past few months. Of the eight items, handwashing is the only precautionary measure recommended by WHO. Consumption of bananas, alcoholic drinks, and ginger tea, as well as drinking warm water and inhalation of water steam (suob/tuob) to fight the disease, were all previously debunked by VERA Files Fact Check. On the other hand, eating or adding hot pepper to meals in order to cure or prevent COVID-19 was already disproved by the WHO in its Mythbusters webpage. The recommendation to use sulfur soap is unsupported. It is plain soap, not even antibacterial soap, that is encouraged by several institutions, including the U.S. CDC, in handwashing. Singapore’s Ministry of Health, in a fact check article by the Agence France Presse (AFP), has also denied issuing the information being spread by the FB post, which apparently also made rounds in Thailand and has versions written in the Thai language. The untrue, viral FB post has already gotten over 1,200 reactions, 900 comments and more than 10,000 shares since it was published. The four-month-old post continues to be shared among Filipino netizens this July as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to rise. As of July 15, the Philippines has the second highest number of COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, with over 57,000 infections. The earliest retrievable version of the fallacious post was published by a netizen on March 15. Other reposts on FB carrying the same claims were published on March 18 by pages Nanay’s Secret Files, OFW sa buong mundo, and Buhay Nanay, collectively accumulating over 5,300 reactions and 12,500 shares since posting.

Facebook user 'Creepy Facts' has recently posted a picture of the girl and a lion, claiming that the lions stayed with her till the help arrived. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be an old incident which was covered by many mainstream international media. Earlier, lion experts had even expressed doubts about the credibility of the story. The message with the Facebook post reads, An Ethiopian girl was being brutally beaten by 7 men when a pride of lions chased them away. They even stayed with her until help arrived. Nearly 200 people shared this post at the time of writing this story, with some doubting the authenticity of the story. Many Facebook users have posted this same story, calling it \"a miracle of God\". During our search, we found that this story was covered by international media such as BBC News and NBC News in 2005. According to BBC News, the 12-year-old girl was abducted by four men on her way home from school in June 2005. A week later, when police tracked the men as they were trying to escape with the girl, the abductors encountered three African lions who chased them off. The lions stayed with the girl without harming her, according to the report. The story had spread like wildfire after BBC quoted a local policeman, sergeant Wondmu Wedaj, who said, They stood guard until we found her and then they just left her like a gift and went back into the forest.\" However, lion experts doubted the credibility of the story. BBC News quoted a few wildlife experts on the same report. They said the lions were probably preparing to eat the girl but were intercepted by the police and others. Another expert said the lions might have spared the girl because her crying may have sounded similar to the mewing of lion cubs. International fact checker Truth or Fiction called the story disputed. There could be different interpretations for the lions’ behavior, but in Africa, the incident was widely reported as a miracle.

            "[Evidences]:It was a beautiful love story. A woodworker named Terry gave his girlfriend, Ana, a special necklace that he crafted himself. More than a year after Ana started wearing the necklace, the pair visited Smoo Cave in the Scottish Highlands, and it was at this moment in November 2016 that Terry revealed to Ana an engagement ring was hidden in a compartment in the necklace. As Terry proposed to her, Ana knew he had been planning to go down on one knee all along. She said “yes.” This was a true story that involved real people named Terry and Ana: an engagement ring really was hidden inside a necklace that Ana wore for more than a year. (The pair’s last names did not appear in news stories after they requested them to be omitted “because of media attention.”) Unfortunately, in late 2020 the tale was seized upon by viral content websites such as FactAhead.com. The website’s creators published a 43-page slideshow which forced readers to click “next page” more than 42 times to read the whole story. The site not only twisted the truth behind the couple’s tale but also spent money to advertise the misleading article online in late 2020 and early 2021. The ads were hosted by the Taboola advertising platform, which we observed appearing on numerous websites: The strategy behind making a single story take 43 pages to read through is known as advertising “arbitrage.” The idea is to bring in more money through ads displayed on each of the 43 pages than it cost to run the initial advertisement that lured readers to the article in the first place. The misleading version of the story claimed that Ana wore the necklace for two years before Terry showed her what was inside of it, but Ana only wore the necklace for a bit more than a year before the big reveal. Viral-content websites also made baseless claims about the couple’s finances, as well as about Ana’s purportedly having a fear of flying. One page of the slideshow story identified a photograph as showing one of Ana’s friends (“Below a photo of Ana’s friend Sofia”), but the picture was merely a stock photograph. The truthful story about Terry and Ana was covered by credible news organizations in 2017. The BBC, for example, reported the following about the materials Terry used to create the necklace: Terry made the necklace from Tasmanian Huon pine and the inside of a seashell. It was hollow inside and this was where the ring was hidden. He gave the necklace to Anna [sic] as a gift to mark the first anniversary of their relationship. Terry said: “She wore it every day and everywhere we went, and pretty much never took it off.” ABC News also reported that Ana wore the necklace for “more than a year”: Still, she had no idea what was really inside until more than a year later. The travel-loving couple decided to trek to Smoo Cave, located in Durness, Scotland, in April. That’s when Terry finally decided to tell Anna [sic] what had been hidden in her beloved necklace. “Before we actually went down to the cave, I asked if I could have the necklace to take some photos of it among the rocks, which gave me a quick chance to break the seal with a knife,” he detailed. And when Terry went to return the necklace to Anna [sic], he opened it to reveal the engagement ring inside. His now-fiancée replied, “Wait … it’s been in there the entire time?” And of course, later she said yes to Terry’s marriage proposal. The “Hidden inside the Necklace” YouTube video created by Terry and Ana has been viewed more than 5 million times: In December 2020, Terry himself addressed the misleading version promoted by viral content websites: Hello all. If you are finding this video now (Nov/Dec 2020) because you got click-baited into reading a long article that was poorly written and full of ads – Sorry. That article has been published without contacting us, and is full of outright lies and extreme uses of “artistic license.” There are heaps of other SHORT articles that are actually legit from 2017/2018. Anyway, sorry, I hope you didn’t waste any ‘important’ time reading it. The couple also said that the websites “really really stretched the truth, and flat out made up some stuff.” Despite BBC, ABC News, and other news organizations’ publishing the woman’s name as “Anna,” we confirmed it was spelled Ana, not Anna. Also, BBC reported that the proposal took place in November 2016, while ABC News published that it occurred in April 2017. In fact, the video about the event was uploaded to YouTube in April 2017, but the proposal had happened months earlier, in November 2016. This dating was confirmed by People.com, who assigned a reporter to speak with the couple. Additional tidbits about the story could be found in the comments for the YouTube video. For example, Terry said he made Ana another necklace since he wasn’t able to properly put the original one back together. He also noted that the new one was empty. Terry observed that he was “paranoid” about Ana’s learning of the hidden engagement ring compartment in the original necklace. He was so afraid she’d find out about his plan that he didn’t take a picture of that part of the process while he was creating the necklace: I was so paranoid about Ana finding photos of the ring being hidden in there on my computer/phone/Google Photos, etc, etc, that I didn’t take a photo of that particular step. If you look at 0:04, you see a thin white line. I carved the spot for the ring and then glue the 2 pieces of wood together with a thin sheet of paper in between. The glue held it together and the paper acted as a weak point to split it apart later. I split it open once to test it, then I sealed the ring in there and finished it up. One YouTuber commented that “That necklace is really ugly tho,” to which Ana replied, “Perhaps not everyone’s taste, but he made it especially for me and I absolutely loved it :).” Editor’s Note: If Terry and Ana would like to correct any part of this story or to add anything, please contact us.

            "[Evidences]:In January 2021 Baringo county governor Stanley Kiptis argued against striking health workers' pay demands. He made three claims. His claim that the county puts 51% of its resources into healthcare is incorrect – it hasn't been more than 37% in three years. The claim that Baringo's healthcare allocation is the highest in Kenya is also incorrect. But it's mostly true that Baringo has exceeded the legislated 35% budget cap on staff costs, \"at 55.7%\". The county spends 54.7% of its budget on employees. In December 2020 healthcare workers in Kenya went on strike over issues such as pay and lack of personal protective equipment. The impasse between the workers and their county governor employers continues, crippling the country's public health sector. Doctors returned to work in late December, but by early February clinical officers and nurses were still on strike. The strikes \"affect how we work\", Dr Chibanzi Mwachonda, secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union , told Africa Check. Governors insist they don't have enough money to meet the workers' pay demands. As the stand-off raged in January, Baringo County governor Stanley Kiptis claimed that more than half of the county's budget went to health, the highest allocation in the country. He also claimed the county had exceeded constitutional salary limits. \"In Baringo, we put 51% of our resources into healthcare,\" he said. \"It's the highest. Baringo and some other counties have gone beyond the 35% ceiling as set in the constitution. We are at 55.7%, so we cannot be in a position of, really, meeting those demands.\" But do the governor's numbers add up? We looked. The governor's spokesperson told Africa Check he would confirm the source of this figure. We will update this report with the county's response. John Kinuthia from the public finance and budgeting think tank International Budget Partnership-Kenya recommended that we examine allocations to county health departments to check health spending. All county budgets are submitted to the office of the controller of budget , a state agency that monitors how they are used. Its most recent report , for the 2020/21 financial year, shows that Baringo allocated KSh2.35 billion of a total KSh6.3 billion budget to its health services department. This works out to 37%. Baringo has not allocated more than this to health in the last three years. We rate the governor's claim as incorrect. Kenya has 47 counties. Kinuthia told us there wasn't any \"guidance concerning what constitutes a health ministry or department in a county\". For example, a \"department of health and sanitation\" could later change to a \"department of health\" and a separate \"department of sanitation and water\". In November 2020, when the agency filed its most recent report, 40 counties had allocated their health budgets to a single department, and four had allocated funding to more than one. Three were yet to submit their budgets to the controller. We compiled the data into a table and calculated the share spent on health ministries. At least three counties allocated more to health than Baringo: Muranga, Nyeri and Embu. Baringo's 37.2% health allocation is among the highest in Kenya, but it is not the highest. We rate the governor's claim as incorrect. Kenya's public finance regulations require counties to cap spending on their employees' wages and benefits at 35% of total revenue. The controller of budget reports that in 2020 Baringo County allocated KSh3.45 billion for \"compensation to employees\". The county's total expected revenue to finance its budget is KSh6.3 billion. \"Personnel emoluments\" – the cost of employee salaries and other benefits – take up 54.7% of the budget. We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct. Most health spending goes to pay For a better understanding of healthcare spending trends in Kenya's 47 counties, Dr Rahab Mbau, a health economist at the Kenya Medical Research Institute , referred Africa Check to a national health ministry analysis . This covers spending in the three financial years to 2018/19 and shows that all counties allocated 79% to 82% to recurrent expenditure. Most of these funds were spent on staff costs such as salaries, wages and allowances. This skew towards staff costs \"doesn't make sense\", Dr Chris Masila, founder of Nairobi-based health consultancy Practhealth , told Africa Check. How much a county spends on health depends on total revenue – and the governor's vision, Masila said. One year's figures may not be enough to fully understand health spending, he said, as some objectives take longer. John Kinuthia from the public finance and budgeting think tank International Budget Partnership-Kenya agreed. \"Priorities always go up and down. Just because a county is spending 20% on health does not make it bad. It might be that they have done a lot of health over the last couple of years.\" Photo: Patrick Meinhardt / AFP\n",

            "[Evidences]:In February 2014, Africa Check published a column which questioned the sourcing of various pre-election claims being made on Twitter by South Africa’s opposition Democratic Alliance (DA).The DA’s then social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the party strives to ensure that any claims its makes are accurate and added that if Africa Check “finds that any of these statistics are inaccurate, we will gladly rectify them.”Many of the DA’s claims relate to its performance in the Western Cape, the only province in the country that is not held by the governing African National Congress. This report - the first of two on the DA - evaluates a number of key claims made by the party on Twitter using the hashtag #DADelivers.It forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on May 7 2014.Claim “In the 2nd half of 2012/13, the WC Provincial Govt. created 60,000 work opportunities via the Expanded Public Works Projects. #DAdelivers” Verdict incorrectClaim “@DA_News municipalities have created 31,000 job opportunities in the past year. #DAdelivers” Verdict unprovenClaim “W Cape has best delivery record in SA: 99.1% of households access piped water, 93.4% electricity & 96.9% have toilet facilities. #DAdelivers” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “The City of Cape Town delivers more to poor residents than any other city in the country. #DAdelivers” Verdict unprovenClaim “The [South African] gap between the 'haves' & the 'havenots' is smallest in City of Cape Town. It has the highest level of equality in SA. #DAdelivers” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “Of the R18 billion spent on service delivery in the City of Cape Town, R11billion is spent on the poor communities. #DAdelivers” Verdict unprovenClaim “80% of the R2 billion spent by the Western Cape Government on tenders during 2012/2013 was paid to #BEEbusinesses. #DAdelivers” Verdict correctClaim “65% of the Western Cape Govt's senior management are previously disadvantaged South Africans. #DAdelivers” Verdict unprovenClaim “76% of the Western Cape Government's budget is redistributed to poor communities. #DAdelivers” Verdict unprovenClaim “8 of the top 10 South African municipalities in the Municipal IQ’s Productivity Index are governed by @DA_News. #DAdelivers” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “In its first four years in government, the DA-governed City of Cape Town tripled the number of houses delivered per year. #DAdelivers” Verdict mostly-correctClaim “The W Cape Govt spends R33.6mil on its Premier’s Advancement of Youth Project & its youth wage subsidy programme every year. #DADelivers” Verdict mostly-correctThe DA’s former social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the claim was based on theExpanded Public Works Programme’s second quarterly report for 2012/13 . But according to that report, 68,044 work opportunities were created in the Western Cape in theof 2012/13, not the second half as stated in the DA’s tweet.If the claim was based on the first half of the year, then it understated performance.The third and fourth quarterly reports - which cover the second half of the year - have yet to be released and it is unclear how many work opportunities were created then. This claim appears to have first been tweeted by Gavin Davis, the DA’s communications director, on 1 March 2013 . It was then recycled by the DA which tweeted it on several different dates including 18 September 18 November and 30 December 2013. The claim was also included in the party’s 2014 election manifesto , which was launched in February 2014.It is therefore unclear whether the claim refers to a calendar year, a financial year or a specific 12 month period. If it was the latter, then - given the fact that the tweet was used on several different dates - which 12 month period did it refer to?According to the DA, the claim is supported by the Expanded Public Works Programme’s second quarterly report for 2012/13 . But that report states that 18,104 work opportunities were created in Western Cape district and metropolitan municipalities between 1 April 2012 and 30 September 2013. A further 7,491 work opportunities were created during the same period in Western Cape local municipalities. Add them together and you get a total of 25, 595.According to the DA, the claim is supported by data collected during South Africa’s 2011 national census The census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water.According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng.However, when it came to accessing toilets, the Western Cape slipped from first place. According to the census, 98.9% of Gauteng households had access to a toilet. In the Western Cape 96.9% of households had access to toilets.(An earlier Africa Check report evaluated similar claims about water access made by the national government.)The DA says the claim is supported by a 2011 report on household access to basic services which was compiled by the national government’s Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs.The report, which in fact used data from 2009, ranked the City of Cape Town first in the country for providing services to households. It stated that 90% of households there had achieved basic service levels and 88% had achieved higher service levels.It’s important to note that the report referred to “the levels of household access to basic service” throughout the city and did not refer specifically to poor residents.Andre Bothma, the DA’s marketing director, told Africa Check that the claim was also supported by the City of Cape Town’s Mid-Year Review (2011-2013) which stated that “[t]he City of Cape Town has the best record of any metro in the country for providing basic services, and providing financial relief to the poor”.However, the review provided no evidence or data to support the claim and it is unclear how it arrived at its conclusion that the city had the “best record of any metro in the country”.The 2012 non-financial census of municipalities revealed that the Western Cape has the highest percentage of households in the country receiving free basic water, electricity and sewerage and sanitation. The DA based the claim on the 2010/2011 State of the World's Cities report produced by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme.The report, which used the Gini coefficient to compare inequality between cities, suggested that East London and Johannesburg were some of the most unequal cities in the world. While Cape Town was found to have high levels of inequality by world standards, it was found to be the least unequal of the South African cities examined for the report. Of the South African cities analysed, Cape Town had the lowest Gini coefficient at 0.67 while East London and Johannesburg had the highest Gini coefficients at 0.75.The 2012/2013 State of the World’s Cities report found that Cape Town was a more broadly prosperous city than Johannesburg, the only other South African city examined.Andre Bothma, the DA’s marketing director, said the claim was based on a 2012 City of Cape Town expenditure analysis. He told Africa Check the document is not publicly available. (This contradicts a statement by Molteno, the DA’s former social media manager, who told us that the DA keeps a database of “DA delivery facts, each accompanied by a reference to a source for it”.)Bothma also referred us to a September 2012 speech by Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille in which the claim was made. But De Lille made no reference to the source of the claim.Her spokesman, Solly Malatsi, said the claim was taken from the City of Cape Town’s 2012/13 budget using “data analytics models”.“Using the basis of service delivery departments as the quantum of focus, we then tabulate expenditure patterns using a ward analysis of geographical income distributions in the City matched against a formula of total spending amounts to arrive at the percentage-based figure,” he explained.Africa Check has been unable to independently verify the accuracy of claim.The DA says the claim is based on a Western Cape government analysis of expenditure .The analysis states that ‘[i]n the 2012/13 financial year, the majority of tenders over R100 000 were awarded to BEE firms. In total, bids worth R1.6 billion went to BEE firms”. This amounts to 80% of the total. The DA claims that the tweet was sourced from the 2013 “Western Cape Human Resource Database”. Bothma told Africa Check that the database was not publicly accessible.When asked if there were other documents that supported the claim, Bothma directed us to a Times LIVE article and a City Press article in which the Western Cape premier and DA leader, Helen Zille, claimed that “77 percent of our 50,521 senior employees fell within the designated 'black group’”. No source for that claim was provided.We have been unable to independently verify the accuracy of the claim.Bothma referred Africa Check to a presentation compiled by Western Cape Premier Helen Zille’s office on provincial ‘ expenditure on the poor ’.However, the source provided does not support the claim.The presentation, delivered by Helen Zille in August 2012, claims that an analysis of a representative sample of departments revealed that 76% of their budgets were redistributed to poor communities. Only the departments of health, education, human settlements, social development and cultural affairs and sport were considered in the analysis. Expenditure in eight other provincial departments was not analysed.This claim has been tweeted a number of times since November 2013 and is said to have been taken from Municipal IQ’s 2013 Productivity Index. Municipal IQ is an independent data service that monitors and assesses South Africa municipalities.The claim is not strictly correct (though it is close) as the index shows that six of the ten top-performing local municipalities are run by the DA and one is run by a DA-Cope coalition.The DA said that the claim was sourced from the Cape Town Story , a booklet published by the DA in March 2011. It claimed that “the post-2006 City government has built three times the number of houses its predecessor managed”.Frouwien Bosman, a DA policy researcher, told Africa Check that the claim was based on comparing the average number of houses delivered under the ANC to the number delivered under the DA in 2008/09 and 2009/10.In 2003/04 2004/05 and 2005/06 , the last three years the ANC ran the City of Cape Town, an average of 3,287 housing opportunities were provided, according to the city's annual reports. Under the DA , 9,576 housing opportunities were delivered in the city in 2008/09 and 8,950 housing opportunities were delivered in 2009/10.In 2010/11 and 2011/12 , the number of housing opportunities delivered dropped to 7,472 and 7,141 respectively. Bothma told Africa Check that the “youth wage subsidy programme” that the tweet refers to is the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism’s “Work and Skills Programme”. Bronwynne Jooste, a spokesperson for the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, told Africa Check that R10-million was spent each year on the programme in 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. Expenditure decreased to R8.9-million in 2012/13 and R13.4-million was spent on the programme in 2013/14.Jooste couldn’t provide a document or an audit to support the figures. She said that the Work and Skills Programme’s expenditure was not accounted for separately in the department’s financial statements and was included under the broader category of “workforce development”.The Premier’s Advancement of Youth Project started in 2012/13. Zak Mbhele, Zille’s spokesman in her capacity as Premier, told Africa Check that R23,1-million is spent every year on the Premier’s Advancement of Youth Project. This, he said, was based on paying 750 interns R2,400 per month for 12 months. An annual amount of R1,5-million is also allocated for administrative costs.But Mbhele was unable to provide documentation to support the figure. “…[T]he remuneration expenditure on the [Premier’s Advancement of Youth Project] is part and parcel of personnel costs across all departments and is not reflected in a separate, collated document,” he explained via email.If the figures provided by Jooste and Mbhele are correct, it would appear that a combined total of R32-million was spent in 2012/13 financial year and a further R36.5 million in 2013/14. These figures are close to, but not in line with, the R33.6-million per year that the DA’s claim refers to. It is unclear how the DA calculated that figure.Edited by Julian Rademeyer Where does the Democratic Alliance get its facts? By Ray Joseph\n",

            "[Evidences]:Video footage of Memphis, Tennessee, police officers beating Tyre Nichols, a Black man who later died of the injuries he sustained during his arrest, prompted discussion about whether federal reforms of law enforcement are needed. During a Jan. 29 interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" host Chuck Todd quizzed U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, about what legislative action he would consider appropriate following Nichols' death. Jordan did not answer that question directly. Instead, he blamed disparaging rhetoric about law enforcement for what he called a shortage of \"good people\" applying to become police officers. \"We shouldn't have this whole attitude about defund the police,\" Jordan said. \"I got a list of 20 jurisdictions that defunded the police to the tune of over $1 billion total. That's a problem when you're trying to attract the best to protect our communities.\" But Jordan's list was based on proposed 2021 budget cuts — some of which were scaled back before the budgets were adopted and some of which were reversed the following budget year. Calls for defunding the police followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Some advocates want to eliminate police departments, but \"defunding\" also can refer to revisiting the functions of police departments and redirecting some of those departments' funding to social services. Jordan's office provided us with the list he referred to, which his staff compiled based on 2020 news coverage of proposed fiscal year 2021 funding decreases for police departments. The list included 21 cities — from Austin, Texas, to San Francisco — that proposed annual budget cuts for their respective police departments, totaling $1.71 billion. The cities on the list initially intended to reduce their fiscal year 2021 police budgets in response to nationwide protests against racial injustice and economic challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, lawmakers in New York City agreed to cut $1 billion in police spending — the largest cut on Jordan's list. But the final, approved budget included cuts of $317 million, less than half the proposed amount. That move alone significantly changes Jordan's math of a $1-billion-plus total in funding cuts. In Austin, officials cut about one-third of the police department's fiscal year 2021 budget. But by fiscal year 2022, the city's budget included a record $442 million for the police, and funding increased even more for fiscal year 2023. Baltimore; Portland, Oregon; and Minneapolis, all of which were included on Jordan's list, sheared millions of dollars from their respective fiscal year 2021 police budgets and later increased those budgets in fiscal year 2022. Cities from New York to Los Angeles backtracked on their push to slash police budgets because of political pressure and rising crime rates, according to NBC News. Jordan said 20 jurisdictions \"defunded the police to the tune of over $1 billion total.\" The list he cited, compiled by his staff, included 21 cities that proposed reducing their annual police budgets in fiscal year 2021 by a collective $1.71 billion. All of the cities on his list had proposed 2021 budget cuts that redirected some money away from police departments. But at least 14 of the cities scaled back the proposed cuts before the budgets were adopted or reversed course the following budget year. One of the largest proposed cuts on the list, in New York City, was reduced from $1 billion to $317 million before the budget passed. Jordan's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The recent fight over raising the debt ceiling -- the limit on how much debt the federal government can carry at a given time -- has brought added scrutiny to the history of the United States’ reliance on debt to finance its operations. During a recent Fox News interview, legal commentator Andrew Napolitano offered an arresting factoid. \"The government today will borrow money to pay debt on money it has already borrowed and spent,\" he said. \"I’ll give you one statistic. Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it. That’s 95 years ago.\" Really? We’re still paying off the cost of World War I? We checked with experts to see if Napolitano is correct. The United States government borrowed a fair amount during the World War I era. Hostilities related to World War I began in 1914, but the United States officially entered the war against Germany in April 1917 and against Austria-Hungary in December 1917. According to Treasury Department statistics on annual debt loads for the United States, the nation’s total debt rose by $23.8 billion between July 1, 1916 (the last available figure before war was declared on Germany) and July 1, 1919 (the first available date after the armistice that ended the war). That’s less than Napolitano said, but a different Treasury data source -- the department’s annual report from June 1920 -- said the U.S. had borrowed a total of $37 billion to finance the war. These two figures average out to about $30 billion, so we’ll accept Napolitano’s figure as a plausible estimate. To finance the war, the government sold Liberty Bonds and Victory Loans. Our first thought upon hearing Napolitano’s claim was that there were still Americans with fraying security certificates in their safe deposit boxes who receive periodic interest payments from the Treasury. But this is not the case. When we contacted the Treasury Department for this story, officials did some digging and found that there are actually still eight Liberty Bonds and two Victory Notes that haven’t yet been redeemed. However, these financial instruments have been mature since 1947, so they haven’t earned any interest for almost 70 years. (Their total value, however, isn’t shabby -- almost $4.2 million.) Napolitano told PolitiFact that he wasn’t referring to ongoing interest payments. Instead, he was referring to the fact that the World War I-era debt was \"rolled over.\" For further explanation, we turned to Linda M. Hooks, an economist at Washington & Lee University. \"The initial debt issued to pay for the war no longer exists,\" Hooks said. \"However, Treasury debt gets ‘rolled over.’ That is, the Treasury sells new bonds to pay off the old bonds that are maturing. So those bonds did mature and get paid off, but the Treasury sold new bonds to pay them off, and then sold new bonds when the second batch matured, and so on.\" So, Hooks said, \"in that sense, you could say the debt is still out there. However, it would be very hard to assign any specific current bond to that specific historical incident.\" Other experts are even more skeptical of Napolitano’s characterization of rolled-over debt as being \"not paid back.\" Since the public debt has not been zeroed out since 1835, by Napolitano’s argument, \"we are still paying off Civil War debt or even the cost of the 1848 Mexican War,\" said Franklin Noll, a historian of United States government financial and monetary history. And that, he added, doesn’t make sense. Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agrees, calling Napolitano’s claim \"obviously false.\" All rolling over debt means, he said, is that federal elected officials have decided that it makes more sense to borrow money to finance other priorities than to increase taxes. \"Every well-run business does this,\" Buchanan said. \"A company might borrow money to build a new office headquarters, and years later its total debt might be higher than it was when the headquarters was financed. That doesn't mean the company is still paying interest on the loans to build the headquarters. It means that the company found that it had better things to do with its money than reduce its debt. Any growing enterprise will do that, and the U.S. economy has been growing for over 200 years, with occasional setbacks.\" Our ruling Napolitano said that \"Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it.\" The original Liberty Bonds and Victory Notes stopped paying interest decades ago. But Napolitano argues that, because the United States has never subsequently zeroed out its debt, the original World War I debt has been rolled over countless times, leaving subsequent bondholders to pay off a small, ancestral fraction of that old debt. That’s one way of looking at it, but not a view that carries much weight with experts, who call the rollover method straightforward and uncontroversial. We rate the claim Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A photo showing two police officers holding a man has gone on viral on social media with the claim that this South African father chased down his three-year-old daughter's rapist and brutally tortured him. The caption with the photo reads, \"This Soweto father tracked down the man who raped his 3-year-old daughter, tied him to tree, cut off the rapist's penis, cooked it, and forced him to eat it.\" Soweto is a township in South Africa. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. The man in the photo was arrested by South African police for allegedly looting and clashing with foreign residents. The post has been viral since April this year when Twitter user 'Zaddy Ajala' tweeted it. Till the filing of this story, it has been retweeted more than 500 times. Several Facebook users have also shared the post. Upon reverse searching the viral photo, we found an old article by Daily Mail which carried this photo. In the report, the viral photo is captioned as, \"A South African resident is arrested by police after allegedly looting and clashing with foreign residents during a xenophobic march by the Mamelodi Concerned Residents through the streets of Pretoria.\" The article was published in February 2017 when violent clashes broke out between black South Africans and immigrants from other African countries in South Africa's capital Pretoria. The viral photo is also available on 'European Pressphoto Agency' with the same piece of information and is titled \"South Africa xenophobia\". Therefore, it is clear that the viral photo has nothing to do with a father who brutally tortured his three-year-old daughter's rapist. In 2014, a similar case was reported in Delhi when a furious father tortured and killed his 14-year-old daughter's alleged rapist. According to a report by The Indian Express, the 36-year-old man burnt the genitals of the alleged perpetrator and then strangled him to death. The incident took place on November 1, 2014.

            "[Evidences]:The 2019 holiday shopping season is upon us. A new NerdWallet survey estimates more than 223 million Americans (88%) plan to purchase gifts this holiday season, spending an estimated $184 billion. Of course, many of those purchases will come in brick-and-mortar stores, but increasingly shoppers are making their buys online. Some believe that trend could get a boost this year due to the short window between Black Friday and Christmas -- 26 days from Thanksgiving to Christmas, down from 32 in 2018. With that backdrop, state Rep. Rob Hutton, R-Brookfield, used the Dec. 4, 2019 GOP weekly radio address to tout his soon-to-be introduced bill to increase the penalties for stealing mail and packages. Hutton started circulating the proposed bill for co-sponsors Dec. 12, 2019. \"Of course, it’s already against the law to steal mail or any other item,\" Hutton said. \"Our laws need to keep up with the shift toward purchasing products online.\" He also said: \"A recent study showed that nearly half of all gifts bought for the holidays are now purchased online. Unfortunately, another study showed as many as 1 in 4 people have had a package stolen from their residence.\" Is he right about the number? The evidence When asked to provide backup for the claim, Hutton’s staff pointed us to the \"2019 Porch Package Theft Report\" by Shorr Packaging Corp., an Aurora, Ill.,-based distributor of packaging products, equipment and services. Here is what the company’s website says about the methodology: \"We surveyed 1,052 online shoppers and asked a variety of questions related to online purchasing habits, package delivery tendencies, and security as it relates to receiving goods purchased online. All respondents live in the U.S., are between the ages of 18-100 and have indicated that they purchase items online through retailers. The survey was conducted between 10/30/2019 and 10/31/2019.\" Shorr Packaging teamed with marketing and analytics agency Garrison Olson on the survey. Kyle Olson, co-founder of Garrison Olson, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin the participants were selected using SurveyMonkey's audience network -- that is, people who volunteer to take surveys. The margin of error is +/- 3%. Here is the relevant line from the report: \"Nearly 1 in 4 online shoppers surveyed (24%) had personally experienced package theft, a 7% decrease compared to the 31% of self-reported package theft victims in our 2017 Package Theft report.\" So, the first part of that sentence tracks with Hutton’s claim on the current number, though the second part suggests security precautions may be making a difference. Indeed, the report itself notes: More than half those surveyed had taken some sort of precautions to prevent package theft, with 45% scheduling a delivery and 33% relying on home security tools. Some 64% of victims have sent packages to a location other than their home to prevent theft. And 78% have changed their plans to be home when a package arrived, even though the package did not require a signature. The study also reported that one of the hottest items on many people’s holiday shopping list this year is a video doorbell. In fact, of the respondents who have been a victim of package theft, 41% said they had purchased a video doorbell. We did find two other sources, both of which are similar surveys, that bolster Hutton’s claim. Security.org surveyed 1,011 shoppers in mid 2019 about package delivery. Only those who have packages delivered to their homes were asked to participate. That effort found \"close to 40% of people have been the victims of so-called porch pirates, who snatch package deliveries from porches, stoops and doorsteps.\" Meanwhile, home security company Canary said in its November 2019 \"Porch Pirates Beware! Report,\" nearly 1 in 5 Americans were a victim, or know someone who was a victim, of porch pirate thefts during the 2018 holiday season. Total sample size was 1,238 adults. The survey was conducted online between Oct. 24 and 25, 2019. A margin of error was not provided. Just how big is the problem? According to Security.org, federal data does not distinguish package theft from other larceny, so it’s not clear exactly how many package thefts take place every year across the country. But according to the FBI’s 2017 Crime in the United States report, the most recent annual data available, more than 5.5. Million larceny thefts were reported across the country Our ruling In the GOP radio address, Hutton said a \"study showed as many as one in four people have had a package stolen from their residence.\" A trio of surveys of online shoppers supports that number, though statistics from law enforcement are hard to come by. We rate the claim True. How to avoid porch piracy Milwaukee Police Officer Jennifer Feather in a \"Cyber Monday\" message posted Dec. 2, 201,9 on the Nextdoor social network for neighborhoods, said porch piracy is preventable. \"The Milwaukee Police Department wants to remind residents to be vigilant this holiday season as packages begin to arrive on our doorsteps.\" Feather also offered tips to neighbors to help thwart package thefts: 1. Keep each other updated about recent package theft activity 2. Share surveillance footage of a package theft in action 3. Ask a neighbor to pick up a package if your plans have you away from home 4. Offer to pick up a neighbor’s packages 5. Request for packages to be sent to your post office or participating location\n",

Let’s verify the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Claim: Video of 20,000 bikers performing a motorbike parade for a 6-years-old boy diagnosed with cancer in Germany. Fact: The video shared in the post shows video clips from two different motorbike parades. The first portion of the video shows an old motorbike parade organized by Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters in San Paulo, Brazil. Jair Bolsonaro held this protest against the state governors and mayors in Brazil for imposing lockdowns to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. In July 2021, around 15,000 bikers have paraded through East Frisian town in Germany to cheer a 6-years-old boy diagnosed with cancer. The last portion of the video shows the boy cheering at the motorcyclists who rallied in thousands for him. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. On reverse image search of the screenshots in the video, similar visuals of the motorcycle parade were found in a video published by a YouTube channel on 14 June 2021. This YouTube channel reported it as the visuals of a motorbike parade led by Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro in San Paulo, Brazil. When we searched for more sources using keywords, we found similar motorbike parade visuals in the videos published by different news websites in June 2021. They can be seen here, here, and here. According to the reports, Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters organised this parade in June 2021 to protest against the state governors and mayors in Brazil for imposing lockdowns to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

            "[Evidences]:Since at least 2020, and likely long before, stories about a disappearing child and a curious father have appeared in articles and YouTube videos. One of the tales about a 5-year-old girl read: “Girl (5) Disappears Every Night – When Father Finds Out Why, He Calls The Police!” A YouTube video carried a similar title: “Five-year-old girl disappears every evening. Her father followed her to this house.” In our research, we found that the stories about the little girl were pure fiction. However, they were perhaps twisted, originating from a real story about an 8-year-old boy. We first stumbled upon the “girl disappears every night” tale in an online advertisement (see above) that showed a 5-year-old girl walking away to a house in the woods. In the ad, she was highlighted with a red circle. According to the 54-page slideshow article, a single father named David was concerned about his little girl, Melissa, because she had been leaving their home for several nights in a row. In the end, he found out that Melissa was going to a nearby house to see her long-lost mother, Milly, who had unexpectedly left them two years earlier. She explained that the reason she ran away was that she wanted to escape her life, so she fled to Thailand. However, she decided to return home after regretting her decision. The headline of the story and ad read: “Girl (5) Walks Away Every Night – When Father Finds Out Why, He Calls The Police!” It initially claimed that David eventually called the police on Milly. However, this didn’t happen at the end of the story. The bit about calling the police was added by the advertiser to entice readers. In June 2021, the Incredible Stories YouTube account posted a new video with stock footage and a narrator. It told a similar story about a girl disappearing every night. The video was viewed nearly 3 million times in less than six months. In this version of the tale, the father’s name was Tom, and the 5-year-old girl’s name was Annie. Instead of the little girl finding her long-lost mother in the house across the way, it turned out to be an old woman named Linda who had fled a nursing home, became homeless, and later found the vacant home. The video didn’t claim that the story was real. However, we did note that this one was also fiction. Our research into the “girl disappears every night” tale led us to an article on top5.com. Its headline read: “8-Year-Old Boy Disappears Every Night, Then Dad Secretly Follows Him And Realizes Why.” The source for this story was a 2014 article on metro.co.uk. It claimed that “a curious father was left stunned after discovering where his young son was going on his daily walks.” It’s true that an 8-year-old boy named Ken Amante would go to feed hungry dogs on the streets of Davao City in the Philippines. We found a Reddit post and Imgur album about this same boy, which were both shared by his father. My son feeding stray dogs (Philippines) However, we were unable to find confirmation from the father’s posts and comments that he was “left stunned after discovering where his young son was going on his daily walks.” According to a second article from metro.co.uk which also was published in 2014, the boy eventually brought in £27,000 — equal to $36,268 USD in donations — to build an animal shelter. It’s named the Happy Animals Club. As of November 2021, the boy was around seven years older. We found that the Happy Animals Club Facebook page and Instagram account were still active with new posts about animal rescues. In sum, the real story about the boy helping animals in the Philippines appeared to be the basis for the fictional “girl disappears every night” tale.

            "[Evidences]:About this rating In April 2023, a Twitter post discussed the inventor of the lobotomy and how he was lauded for what was a controversial and often poorly done procedure. Eli David, who also has expressed anti-vaccination views on his Twitter account, wrote, \"'The science was settled'\", and the inventor of lobotomy received the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1949. The science is never settled. Never blindly trust the experts, and never 'believe in science'.\" \"The science was settled\", and the inventor of lobotomy received the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1949. The science is never settled. Never blindly trust the experts, and never \"believe in science\". pic.twitter.com/My30CSNnOm — Dr. Eli David (@DrEliDavid) April 30, 2023 Egas Moniz, a Portuguese scientist who pioneered the use of the lobotomy to treat mentally ill patients, did indeed win the Nobel Prize for this work in 1949. Per the Nobel Prize website, he was awarded \"for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses.\" Leucotomy, which was later termed lobotomy, consisted of incisions that destroyed connections between the prefrontal region and other parts of the brain, and was often used in the treatment of schizophrenia, among other mental disorders. According to a 2014 paper on Moniz in the Singapore Medical Journal, Moniz believed that \"certain obsessive and melancholic persons could be helped if their frontal lobes were excised.\" The paper detailed his first operation that was lauded by the Nobel committee: In order to accomplish the leucotomy, Moniz again worked with Lima to develop a needle-like instrument with a retractable wire loop. The instrument, named a leucotome, allowed the wire to travel through the posterior aspect of the frontal lobe, cutting through the white matter fibres of the brain. In earlier procedures, Moniz used absolute alcohol to destroy the frontal lobe. Moniz's first psychosurgery, performed on 12 November 1935, was described by the Nobel Committee as one of the most important discoveries ever made in psychiatric medicine. In that case, the patient was a 63-year-old woman suffering from depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations and insomnia. Barahona Fernandes, a psychiatrist, evaluated the patient two months following the alcohol injection to the frontal lobes, remarking that \"the patient's anxiety and restlessness had declined rapidly with a concomitant marked attenuation of paranoid features\". While it is true that Moniz was awarded for a controversial procedure, his win should be taken into context. At the time it was consideredby many scientists as a good solution because the alternative was seen as worse: mental asylums filled with patients who were mistreated and often subjected to physical violence. However, the procedure also had increasingly poor results, and scientists turned their backs on it by the 1950s. Henry Marsh, a former psychiatric nurse who used to see lobotomized patients and later became an eminent neurosurgeon, told the BBC, \"It reflected very bad medicine, bad science, because it was clear the patients who were subjected to this procedure were never followed up properly. If you saw the patient after the operation they'd seem alright, they'd walk and talk and say thank you doctor. The fact they were totally ruined as social human beings probably didn't count.\" The Singapore Medical Journal also noted, \"Unarguably more manageable post lobotomy, lobotomised patients were also left with irreversible changes in their persona, and were described as mental invalids and drooling zombies. Moniz himself came under attack for understating the complications, inadequate documentation and poor patient follow-up.\" According to the Nobel Prize website, \"The operation was widespread during the 1940s and 1950s, but it became apparent that it could lead to serious personality changes. The use of lobotomies declined drastically when medications for mental illness were developed during the 1950s.\" While poor scientific practice has long been a part of human history, that should not be a reason to encourage a blanket distrust of scientists and doctors today. Comparing a scientific invention from almost a century ago to innovations today ignores necessary context.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: In 2010, Betty Sutton \"voted to destroy Medicare.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Senior citizens, you are dupes and rubes. That seems to be what too many politicians and the political groups think of you, anyway (we disagree vehemently), the way they try to scare you.Both parties are guilty, as PolitiFact has noted repeatedly, but today, it’s the National Republican Congressional Committee’s turn. Consider what the NRCC said on July 30, in an apparent attempt to gain senior votes:Congresswoman Betty Sutton \"voted to destroy Medicare.\"No, Sutton did not. This is a bit like the earth-is-flat argument, put to rest hundreds of years ago. PolitiFact has been through several iterations of the Medicare claim, voiced in variations by both parties, but here’s the thing: People are still using it.The NRCC claim is based on Sutton’s 2010 vote to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which you might know as \"Obamacare.\" The act, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, aims to make health care readily available to uninsured Americans. But it also slows the rate at which Medicare will grow over the next decade. Medicare is the government program that provides health insurance to seniors, and a number of experts say its growth rate is unsustainable.So here is what will happen to spending on Medicare because of the Affordable Care Act. Its cost will grow $7.1 trillion over a decade, according to Congressional Budget Office projections previously reviewed by PolitiFact.You read that right. It will grow.Without the Affordable Care Act, Medicare spending would grow even more, by an additional $500 billion. The difference means the rate of growth will be slowed by about 7 percent.With $500 billion less, you’d think that Medicare might have to scale back its ambitions or services. President Barack Obama’s administration says the savings will come from eliminating waste and duplication. Savings also will come from a program called Medicare Advantage, which provided extra money to private insurers in hopes that they would expand their coverage to more rural areas. That didn’t happen, so the government says it wants to stop giving them extra money and will grade Advantage programs -- and give or withhold bonuses -- based on effectiveness.Reasonable people can be suspicious as to how, exactly, this will play out. Some Medicare Advantage patients have enjoyed a generous level of government benefits, and they fear they will lose some.But the CBO has been clear: Medicare spending will grow. The Affordable Care Act has extra money for prevention services, and seniors are getting a break on out-of-pocket expenses for their prescription drugs.OK, don’t believe the government. Skepticism is healthy and sometimes deserved. Now consider that Sutton, a Democratic congresswoman from Copley Township, voted for the Affordable Care Act.Does that mean that she \"voted to destroy Medicare,\" as the NRCC said in its news release July 30?We asked NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill about the claim, since Prill sent the email to reporters. Prill cited, among other things, a Washington Post articlein 2010 that described $500 billion worth of \"cuts\" to Medicare under the health law.But the Washington Post’s own Fact Checker column has been over this repeatedly, and has saidthe characterization of \"cuts\" is an \"oldie but goodie.\" (The Post also said, \"Someone must be falling for this stuff, however, or else it would not keep getting repeated.\")Prill also cited a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in 2011 that referred to health care \"rationing\" from an unelected 15-member Medicare advisory panel. The piece said that this Independent Payment Advisory Board, to be appointed by the president by 2014 to make recommendations on controlling Medicare costs, could \"throw granny over the cliff\" if Medicare isn’t reformed.Granny doesn’t want to go over the cliff, assuredly. But Prill’s third piece of backup seems to soften that likelihood.Prill cited a story last March from Bloomberg BNAabout a House of Representatives committee hearing in which health experts discussed the Medicare advisory panel’s power. They said the panel’s real power will be limited, leaving members few choices other than to recommend cutting fees that doctors earn by treating Medicare patients. Doctors in turn will limit the number of Medicare patients they see, stop taking new ones or quit practicing, one witness said.We’re not sure if that’s the same as throwing granny over the cliff. But that very argument -- that doctors will stop taking Medicare patients or quit -- is voiced every year right now, because of what has been a regular failure by Congress to assure physician reimbursements. Granny’s doctor is tired of this annual game, and says so regularly. Yet this plays out as often as the buzzards return to Hinckley, Ohio.Might Medicare change? It’s possible. If you are in an Advantage plan, you might want to ask your insurer a lot of questions or look at other coverage options.But destroying Medicare is strong medicine, and it goes far beyond the inconvenience of changing coverage. Sutton did not prescribe it.In fairness, both parties play this game. Sutton falsely accused her Republican opponent, Rep. Jim Renacci, of voting to \"end Medicare\" because he supported Republican budgets that would privatize the program and provide vouchers. PolitiFact Ohio gave Sutton a Falseon the Truth-O-Meter for making the claim.That doesn’t make the GOP claim against her any more accurate.On the Truth-O-Meter, the NRCC claim rates False.\n",

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here. Claim: Gomathi from TN won gold for India in Asian games wearing two different torn shoes because she can’t buy one and the government is not helping her. Fact: She won the gold medal in the Asian Athletics Championships, not in the Asian Games. She has herself clarified that she wore the torn shoes in the finals because they were her lucky shoes, not because she can’t buy new ones. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. When searched for the news on Google, it is found that Gomathi Marimuthu won the gold medal for India in 800 metres in the Asian Athletics Championship 2019, held at Doha. So, it was not at the Asian Games, as claimed in the post. Also, in an interview published in the SPORTSTAR article, she clarified about the recent controversy on her shoes. She said, “I have heard this so many times (the shoe issue). It is not like that. The pair I wore during the race were lucky ones. I am very sentimental about that pair so I used it for the final.” So, it was not that she could not buy a new pair; she wore the torn shoes out of sentiment. Also, in an interview given to ‘THE HINDU’, her mentor Francis Mary also commented on the issue saying, “Since the pair was two years old, she had stitched and used them. There are sentiments attached to it. We have ordered a new pair. It is yet to reach her.” To sum it up, in the Asian Athletics Championships Final, Gomathi wore the torn shoes because they were her lucky shoes.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Ever since the Great Recession in 2007-09, Missouri lawmakers have been trying to change Missouri’s unemployment benefits. House Bill 228 is the General Assembly’sthird attempt in the past four legislative sessionsto offer unemployment benefits on a sliding scale. If passed, the bill would link the amount of weeks a person could receive unemployment benefits to the state’s unemployment rate. Currently, Missouri offers up to 20 weeks of unemployment benefits.The bill proposesthat when Missouri has a low unemployment rate — 6 percent or lower — benefits would be available for only 13 weeks. As the rate increases, so do the benefits. At most, people could collect up to 20 weeks of benefits if the unemployment rate is 9 percent or higher. Supporters said the bill will ensure the state does not deplete the state’s unemployment trust fund, which is how Missouri saves money for unemployment benefits during recessions. When the fund reaches zero, the state must borrow money from the federal government, which involves paying high interest rates.Employers pay separate taxesto fund boththe stateand federal unemployment trust fund. The bill’s fiscal notesreport it could save the state’s unemployment fund up to $82 million per year. The House passed HB 288 on February 23, and it now awaits a vote in the Senate. In the days after the House voted, Rep. Allen Andrews, R-Grant City, was quoted about the billin an article on KMA Land, a website produced by a radio news station based in Shenandoah, Iowa. Andrews said, \"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns. Thisisn’t the onlytimeAndrews has stated this.A fewlegislatorsand theMissouri Chamber of Commercehave repeated the statement as well. So we wanted to check it out. Missouri borrowing Andrews never answered PolitiFact’s many emails and calls, so we went to find the data on our own. According to theNational Bureau of Economic Research, the last five recessions were To find out whether Missouri borrowed a Federal Title XII loan to pay for unemployment benefits deficits during those time periods, we went to theU.S. Department of Labor. The data showed that at year’s end of the following years, Missouri had borrowed money to fully fund unemployment benefits claims: These year years don’t exactly match up with the recessions —Missouri borrows just after the recessions’ end dates —but that’s normal, said Robert Pavosevich, lead actuary for the U.S. Department of Labor. States usually take out loans at the end of a recession, not in the middle, when unemployment remains high, he said. In fact, Pavosevich said that using the strict definition of a recession \"wouldn’t be fair.\" \"When people talk about recession, generally they’re talking about when unemployment is high, not the official date,\" he said. \"(Andrews) probably meant the time period overall.\" So far, Andrews is correct: Missouri has borrowed money from the federal government in the last five recessions to make up for deficits in its unemployment trust fund —but is it the only state to do so? The only state A review of data on borrowing by the other 49 states along with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands confirms that Missouri is indeed the only state to receive a loan from the federal government for the unemployment trust fund during the past five economic downturns. There are five close contenders that borrowed during four of the five recessions: Neither Michigan nor Connecticut borrowed for the 2001 recession, while Minnesota, Texas and Illinois didn’t borrow for the 1990-91 recession. Pavosevich said there were two other ways that could invalidate Andrews’ claim. States could have borrowed and paid back a loan within a year, which wouldn’t have been represented on the data available on the department’s website. Additionally, several states use private borrowing to pay back the Title XII loan to the government by selling state bonds to the private market; these states have outstanding loans for unemployment benefits but not to the government. Pavosevich looked into the data, which isn’t publicly available, for these two caveats —paying the Title XII loan within the year and private borrowing —and found that Missouri is the only state to to have taken out a loan during or right after each of the last five recession. \"(It) appears that the statement is true if you consider recessionary periods rather broadly,\" Pavosevich concluded in an email. Our ruling Andrews said, \"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns.\" According to the data from the U.S. Department of Labor, not only did Missouri take out loans from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during economic downturns, but also it is the only state to do so. We rate this claim as True. \n",

Kenyatta was also mostly on the money regarding matters of economy and trade. Kenya has increased its trade within the East African Community, helped loosen trade regulations across the continent, and improved in international ease-of-doing-business rankings. But while the textbook-to-pupil ratio in the first grades of school is nearly one to one, it is incorrect that 100% of students progress from primary to secondary education, and this repeats previously unproven claims. ​​​​​​In November 2020 Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta reported on the state of the nation, nearly one and a half years since the last such address. The speech centred on his administration's efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its \"Big Four\" agenda that is focused on health, housing, manufacturing and food security. The president also made claims of progress in various areas from education and land to the business environment and electricity connections. We checked the accuracy of eight of Kenyatta's pronouncements. We have contacted the presidency for the source of the data used in the claims and will update this report with their response. To stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, in March 2020 Kenyatta said a nationwide curfew would be \"in effect in the territory of the republic of Kenya\" from 7 pm to 5 am. Starting on 27 March , the curfew's hours have varied. At the time of writing, it is in place until 3 January 2021 between 10 pm and 4 am. In his November address , Kenyatta said the curfew was \"Kenya's first ever nationwide curfew since independence\". The best records on curfews would be the legal notices published in the Kenya Gazette as required by the Public Order Act , Dr Mutuma Ruteere told Africa Check. Ruteere is the director of the Centre for Human Rights and Policy Studies in Nairobi. A former United Nations special rapporteur , he has written extensively on security, policing and terrorism in Kenya. \"When a curfew is declared, it has to be gazetted,\" Brian Kimari told us. He is a junior research fellow at the thinktank and has authored a policy brief on the curfew during the pandemic. Kimari could not find an instance of another nationwide curfew, and we also came up empty when we scoured the gazette's archives . Historic curfews regional or pre-independence The records do show that regional curfews have been declared before, in north-eastern Kenya in the 1960s and 70s during the shifta war and more recently during operations against the al-Shabaab terror group. Curfews were also in place in the cities of Nairobi and Nanyuki during the 1982 coup attempt , in some districts during various security operations, and during the 2007/08 post-election violence. A news article from March 2020 said a national curfew had been in place before but under a colonial era state of emergency, citing veteran Kenyan administrator Joseph Kaguthi. Kimari said that the reference to the curfew by Kenyatta was meant to signal that the pandemic is \"a very serious moment\" for the country, but it also cast a spotlight on the \" securitisation of the pandemic response \". – Alphonce Shiundu Kenya's government took over the distribution of textbooks from schools in January 2018 . For the most recent data on this, Dr Emmanuel Manyasa directed us to the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development . He is the executive director of Usawa Agenda , an advocacy group in the education sector. The 2019 basic education statistical booklet notes that the education ministry distributed books \"on numeracy and literacy because they are the foundational skills in education\". \"The data shows that the 1:1 pupil-textbook ratio in mathematics, English and Kiswahili has almost been achieved in Grade 1, 2 and 3,\" the booklet says . It breaks this down by grade and enrolment.  The ratios have been rounded up, meaning some pupils were sharing books. For example, some 49,088 grade 1 pupils would not have had their own textbook. Why is the ratio important? According to the education ministry , pupils sharing textbooks with more than one other child achieved less. \"Ideally, more learning material should improve learning outcomes,\" Manyasa told Africa Check. But there were also other factors at play, he said, such as teacher shortages, especially in the rural areas. – Alphonce Shiundu Kenyatta compared this number to the six million title deeds he said had been issued from independence in 1963 to when he took office in 2013. He made the same claim in another national address in June 2020. ( Note: Since 2012 title deeds are also referred to as \"certificates of title\" in Kenya. They prove that the person named in the certificate owns the land. ) Since June 2020, the lands ministry website has claimed that 4.5 million deeds have been issued \"since 2013 compared to 5.6 million since independence\". In June Farida Karoney, the cabinet secretary for lands, gave Africa Check a similar number of 5.6 million from 1963 to 2012. From 2013 to June 2019 about 4.1 million deeds were issued, she said, and 388,000 from July to April 2020. The minister's figures added up to 4.49 million. We have asked Karoney for the number of deeds issued since April and will update this report once we receive a response. Only the ministry can confirm the number of deeds it has issued, the Kenya Land Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation that advocates for land reform in the country, previously told Africa Check. – Vincent Ng'ethe Every year, the World Bank publishes a report ranking how friendly countries make their economies to investors. The most recent, Doing Business 2020 , ranks Kenya 56th out of 189 countries.  In the sub-Saharan Africa region the country was third after Mauritius and Rwanda. The 2015 report , using data current as of June 2014, placed Kenya 136th. So on this score the president was accurate. The presidency has also cited the country's progress up the rankings in previous years . –Vincent Ng'ethe World Bank pauses ease of doing business rankings The ease of doing business rankings have in recent years come in for international scrutiny . Kwame Owino is the chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs , a thinktank in Nairobi. In his view, the report is of questionable use, he told Africa Check. The methodology \"has been questioned within the World Bank itself\" and while the ranking is seen as an end in itself, it \"does not necessarily lead to more investment\". Owino also said the rankings were weighted in favour of large formal businesses. \"But if you know we have a huge informal sector, many of the things spoken about in the Ease of Doing Business report don't affect them as much.\" In Kenya, 83% of employment was in the informal sector , according to the 2020 economic survey . Further, he said, the report has an \"urban bias\" as it considers only the capital Nairobi and not the country's 46 other counties. On 27 August, the World Bank said that it was looking into irregularities around data published in the 2018 and 2020 Doing Business report. \"The publication of the Doing Business report will be paused as we conduct our assessment,\" the bank said. The African Continental Free Trade Area is expected to increase trade both within Africa and with other regions and has been described as the largest free trade area in the world based on the number of countries. The agreement establishing it was signed by 54 of the bloc's 55 members in March 2018 during an African Union summit in Rwanda. Eritrea has not yet signed. The agreement's status list shows Kenya was the first to ratify it on 6 May 2018, a day ahead of Ghana. Some 28 countries had ratified the agreement as of October 2019, meaning they agreed to be bound by its terms. – Vincent Ng'ethe According to Kenya Power , the country's electricity utility, \"last mile\" refers to the last link to the consumer's premise or home. In June 2020 we rated as unproven a claim by Kenyatta that the government had connected 8 million households to the electric grid. Because of a delay in appointing Kenya's auditor-general, the utility firm only published its 2018/19 annual report in November 2020. The report shows that in the year to June 2019, some 306,771 customers were connected to electricity. ( Draft treasury figures gave a figure of 440,822 customers .) As of 30 June 2019, the annual report showed Kenya Power had connected 5.4 million domestic consumers. Another 1.29 million were connected under the rural electrification programme, for a total of 6.7 million. Domestic connections accounted for 94.5% of all customers. This category has over the last five financial years accounted for at least a 90% share of the total. On its website, Kenya Power says that as of June 2020 it \"sells electricity to over 7.5 million\" but does not specify how many customers were domestic. The available data accounts for 6.7 million of the 7.2 million connections cited by the president. Kenya Power's 2019/20 annual report, to be published in January 2021, will likely give newer data but in its absence we rate the claim as unproven. – Vincent Ng'ethe The East African Community counts six member countries – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The 2020 economic survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that in 2019, Kenya made KSh140 billion in exports to the other countries. This was the highest since 2013. The finalising of the community's common market protocol meant that its members were trading more with each other, Dr Paul Kamau told Africa Check. He is a senior fellow at the University of Nairobi's Institute for Development Studies and has published research on Kenya's trade in East Africa. \"This could be giving the business community more confidence,\" he said, adding that as markets such as the US and China get more competitive, there has been more focus on regional markets. – Vincent Ng'ethe In his previous state of the nation address in April 2019, the president claimed the country had achieved a 100% transition from primary to secondary school. We fact-checked the claim then and found it to be incorrect. There are conflicting claims about the transition rate in 2019. In February 2019, an education ministry report said the transition rate was 93%. Citing the ministry's data , the 2020 economic survey published by the national statistics office in April gave the transition rate for 2019 as 85.5%. The 2019 basic education statistical booklet from the ministry put it at 95% for 2019. A year later, in February 2020, education minister George Magoha claimed a 99.8% transition rate. We have contacted the education ministry for clarity. The available data however does not show a 100% transition rate in 2019 or 2020. Experts have previously told Africa Check that achieving this full rate is difficult in the absence of a law making secondary school compulsory. Secondary school is also not completely free and this will keep some students away. We therefore rate the president's claim as incorrect. – Vincent Ng'ethe\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Alex Sink supported \"a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The Republican Party of Florida has wasted no time launching attacks against Democrat Alex Sink, the former state CFO who just announced her run for the late C.W. Bill Young’s congressional seat. There’s a lot of different claims out there, most of which are summed up in a YouTube ad: \"As Florida’s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state’s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida’s debt.\" We’ve already checked Sink’s ties to the pension fund. In this fact-check, we’ll look into her relationship to the Florida debt. First things first: We broke down the state debt level at the end of each fiscal year, according to a report by the Division of Bond Finance. Dollar figures are in billions. The GOP subtracted the 2006 number from the 2010 number, which does give us a difference of $5.2 billion. But since Sink took office in January 2007, the first budget she was in office for was fiscal year 2008, and the last would’ve been 2011. When we take that difference, we get $3.4 billion. It’s still a significant amount of debt, to be sure, but it’s not quite as high as the ad made it out to be. As we’ve noted in similar fact-checks, the implication here is that Sink in particular played a large role in increasing Florida’s debt. As chief financial officer from 2007 to 2011, her duties included accounting, auditing and managing Florida’s finances, in addition to serving on the State Board Administration with the governor and attorney general. In Florida, legislators are required to balance the budget each year, unlike in the federal government. But the state can issue bonds to pay for capital improvement projects like road improvements and the construction of educational facilities. A significant part of the debt during Sink's term was $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds to add class space to the state's schools, brought about by a 2002 amendment to the Florida Constitution that reduced class sizes. Additionally, while the CFO oversees finances, it's the state Legislature that passes a budget. \"It’s the Legislature who decides how much bonding is going to be done,\" said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. The Cabinet and the governor sign off on the Division of Bond Finance’s bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects. The Cabinet consists of three members, including the the CFO, the attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture. Neither the Republican Party of Florida nor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could point us to an instance where Sink voted against issuing bonds. But approving the bond issues is business as usual for the governor and Cabinet, so it’s routine for the vote to pass without disagreement. It is considered acceptable for the CFO to disagree with the governor on financial matters, said Susan MacManus, University of South Florida state government professor. But the fact that so many Cabinet and legislative officials (many of whom were Republicans) get a say in appropriations means the financial blame doesn’t fall to Sink alone. \"You can’t say that she has no responsibility for it,\" MacManus said. \"You could probably say that it’s shared responsibility.\" The CFO also doesn’t have the same veto power the governor does over bond appropriations, said Khi Thai, Florida Atlantic University public budgeting professor. \"Alex Sink can express her ‘support’ but cannot ‘vote down’ the Legislature's bond appropriations,\" Thai added. Aside from that distinction, it’s worth remembering that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink’s term as CFO, not just Florida. The state’s trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation’s. Florida government, be it the Legislature or the Cabinet, shouldn’t shoulder all the blame for a widespread recession. Our ruling As CFO, Sink did watch the debt increase over her term, but by $3.4 billion, not $5.2 billion. Plus, the Legislature, not the Cabinet, has most of the say in bond appropriations. Not to mention there was a nationwide recession that took its toll on the Florida economy, which is out of the hands of state officials. Given all these hefty clarifications, we rate the Florida Republican Party of Florida’s claim Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:On 6 July 2015, the entertainment web siteReal News Right Now published an article reporting that Pope Francis announced during a sermon that he had been instructed by God to change the Ten Commandments: During his sermon, Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had called upon him, instructing him “to revise the most sacred of texts, the Ten Commandments.” Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices. Pope Francis said Christians around the world are “faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society.” The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments. The Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards one’s parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend “God’s grace to all His children.” Although Real News Right Now does not includes a disclaimer identifying its content as fake news, the above-quoted story is just that: another piece of fake news. Real News Right Now has published a number of other fabricated news items, including an article about President Obama’s stripping Texas of statehood and an article about his banning the possession of Confederate flags. The biggest indicator that Real News Right Now is a fake news publication comes from the site’s “About” page, where author R. Hobbus J.D. brags about winning fictional awards such as the “Oscar Mayer Award for Journalistic Excellence” and the “Stephen Glass [a journalist notorious for falsifying news stories) Distinction in Journalistic Integrity.”\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Reaching out to students and their check-writing parents, Gov. Scott Walker is promising another tuition freeze at UW System schools. And now in the final weeks of his re-election showdown with Democrat Mary Burke, the first-term Republican is blaming her for past tuition hikes. \"With two sons in college, I know how hard it is to pay for school,\" Walker says in a TV ad released Oct. 20, 2014. \"That’s why we froze tuition at UW campuses. I want to freeze it again in my next term. My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent.\" In the campaign, Burke has said she’d like to freeze tuition -- but only if more aid can go to the University of Wisconsin System at the same time. She’s emphasized larger income tax deductions for tuition and refinancing student loans. But, looking back, is the governor right about Burke’s support of policies that led to an 18 percent increase? Let’s hit the books. Walker’s evidence The ad itself lists no footnote as evidence for the 18 percent figure and does not cite any specific policies backed by Burke, who served as head of the state Commerce Department under Gov. Jim Doyle from 2005 to 2007. A Walker campaign news release about the ad simply offers the history of UW tuition increases approved in state budgets back to 1967, and Burke’s statement to a reporter in April 2005 that she supports Doyle’s positions \"entirely.\" A campaign spokesperson pointed us to Burke’s general praise of two of Doyle’s budgets in place during her state government career. None of that makes any direct link between Burke and tuition hikes. That’s not surprising, given that Burke’s job was to grant and track state aid to businesses, not run the UW System, which sets tuition rates in conjunction with lawmakers and the governor. We did a search of news stories from the time and found no statements by Burke about raising tuition. She did, in 2007, praise a Doyle budget investment in more financial aid to help families better afford college. More broadly, Burke promoted Doyle’s overall 2007-’09 budget as a \"smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses\" that is \"fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities\" while including \"more than a dozen separate tax cuts, saving the taxpayers and businesses of Wisconsin $1.7 billion.\" Tuition history There’s no doubt UW tuition rose rapidly in the Doyle era, which ran from 2003 through 2010. Tuition rates jumped 18 percent his first year, and 15 percent the second. But that was in the 2003-’04 and 2004-’05 school years -- before Burke arrived. After that, increases ranged from 0 percent to 9.3 percent, depending on the year and whether it was a four-year or two-year school, UW-Madison or UW-Milwaukee. Increases were capped at about 5 percent for several years. When Doyle took office, tuition at the system’s flagship UW-Madison campus was $3,854. When he left in 2010 it was $7,933. If you look specifically at Burke’s time in state government, tuition rose 19 percent in those three years, with some variations for different UW campuses. Under Walker, tuition went up 11 percent over his first two years, then was frozen for 2013-’14 and 2014-’15. The difference -- and it’s a big one -- is that Walker directly controlled those changes while Burke had little or nothing to do with them. We’ve been here before. In March 2014, we rated False a Republican Party of Wisconsin claim it was Burke’s budget in 2007-’09 that contained a series of tax hikes. We concluded it is off base to put responsibility for the state budget and its thousands of provisions on an appointed cabinet secretary. Likewise, it is wrong to blame a secretary for spending changes in another department. Our rating Walker said, \"My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent.\" Burke was in state government when that happened, but Walker offers no evidence that she backed tuition hikes other than Burke lauding her boss as she went to work for Doyle. We rate his claim False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: SaysWisconsin ‘could compel’ Foxconn to install solar panels that would power 33,000 homes.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Saying Wisconsin made a \"bad deal\" to bring Foxconn to the state, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers argues Wisconsin should force the company to be the best corporate citizens in the state. He suggested the state put Foxconn’s \"feet to the fire\" to make the company provide high wages and benefits, as well as transportation for workers who do not live close to the Racine County plant. Then Evers took it one step further. \"We could compel Foxconn to put solar panels on the roof, and there'd be enough electricity generated to serve 33,000 homes in southeast Wisconsin,\" Evers said in an April 22, 2018, interview on UpFront with Mike Gousha on WISN-TV (Channel 12). Evers said he thinks Foxconn — which has begun work on a $10 billion facility that is to employ up to 13,000 in Racine County — is \"all in,\" so renegotiating shouldn’t jeopardize the deal. Can the state force such an action at this point? And, if it forced the solar panels, could the panels really power more than 30,000 homes? Let’s take a look. Asked to back up the claim, Evers spokeswoman Maggie Gau said he was drawing from a Wisconsin State Journal column from August 2017. In the piece, John Imes, executive director for the Madison-based Wisconsin Environmental Initiative, presented the idea as a hypothetical. \"Imagine if … all of the roofs on those facilities were covered with the latest solar panel technology?\" Imes wrote. \"The buildings would generate over 200 (megawatt-hours) of electricity each year, enough to power almost 33,000 homes.\" But experts say a solar system with the kind of capacity Evers describes would have to be several hundred megawatts -- unprecedented for a rooftop solar array. A handful of U.S. solar farms — in places like Arizona and California — have this capacity, but those are dedicated, ground-based units. PV Magazine, a solar industry publication, says the largest rooftop system now is less than 20 megawatts, though Tesla has begun work on one around 70 megawatts. Such a system at Foxconn could cost $250 million to $500 million, said David Feldman, an economic and financial analysis researcher with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Experts disagree on whether a system that size would be enough to power 33,000 homes. The planned Foxconn campus will cover about 22 million square feet, though a company spokesman declined to specify how much roof square footage will be involved (multi-story buildings would obviously reduce the available roof space). Two of the three solar experts we talked with said a roof around that size could feasibly provide enough power. Cara Marcy, renewable electricity analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said a roof at 22 million square feet -- based on the typical sunshine in Mount Pleasant -- could generate about 430,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually. That’s above the roughly 300,000 megawatt-hours that 33,000 homes would need, based on the typical energy usage in Wisconsin. Ben Zientara, lead researcher and policy analyst for Solar Power Rocks, said a solar array could be enough to power 33,000 homes at 13 million square feet, well below the size of Foxconn. However, that would require flat-mounted arrays, which would be more susceptible to snow buildup. But calculations by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities in the state, showed solar panels on 22 million square feet of roof would only generate enough electricity for about 24,000 homes, said spokesman Matthew Spencer. All calculations required some assumptions or approximations based on the type of solar panels — fixed or movable on one or two axes to tilt with the sun — and the space between panels. Experts also noted not all of the roof space would be usable for solar panels. The size of such a project means it is much more than a math problem, however. Marcy said it’s not realistic to describe generators in terms of homes powered because solar power is so inconsistent. It is obviously not available at night, or for long stretches of winter. \"The solar facilities are not necessarily generating electricity at the same time electricity is needed by the system consumer, so from that perspective I think it’s inaccurate to say it's meeting the electricity of these homes,\" she said. A typical solar array has a maximum capacity around 20%, meaning there is enough sunshine to generate electricity about one-fifth of the time, experts say. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s solar resource calculator assumes 16%, but Wisconsin would face a challenge typical high-use solar states would not — snow removal. Spencer, whose agency is run by three commissioners appointed by Gov. Scott Walker, said companies that install solar arrays typically use the electricity for themselves first, then sell any unused power back to the grid. Spencer said it is likely not legal for Foxconn to provide electricity directly to the public — as the claim suggests — without going through the agency to become certified as a public utility. This brings us to where Evers’ claim started – whether Wisconsin \"could compel\" Foxconn to build such a thing. Requirements like installing solar panels could be fair game as part of negotiating an incentive package for a company like Foxconn. But for Foxconn, those negotiations are already over. \"Any discussions about what could have been included in that contract are hypothetical and moot at this point since the state already has an executed contract in place,\" said Mark Maley, spokesman for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The agency is run by a 12-member board of Republican appointees, though it includes two Democratic party representatives. Maley said contracts do change in some cases, such as if the agreed-upon number of new jobs changes. That would open up a new negotiating window where changes to the agreement itself could theoretically happen. Jack Huddleston, emeritus professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said trying to re-open negotiations now would be \"pretty risky\" for the state. \"The Development Agreement (DA) that was agreed to by all involved parties was a result of trade-offs made by each party,\" he said in an email. \"If Foxconn, for example, agrees to renegotiate, it may demand new requirements to compensate for the loss of previously agreed to components.\" Gau, the Evers spokeswoman, noted Foxconn has made investments in renewable power in other countries. \"If they are doing this there, why not here?\" she said in an email. \"Companies can be compelled to follow certain hiring practices like wages and employing workers from certain geographic areas, why not renewable energy for on-site sustainability or surrounding homes?\" Evers says the state \"could compel\" Foxconn to install solar panels, and those would have enough capacity to power 33,000 homes. Experts say the quoted capacity is theoretically possible, though it would be extremely expensive and vastly larger than anything put on a roof in the world to date. And the logistical issues are many. Meanwhile, Foxconn construction is underway and incentive agreements have been signed, so the state doesn’t appear to have a route to force such action unless outside factors lead to reopened negotiations. We rate Evers’ claim Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A social media post featuring an image of former BJP MP Dr. Subramanian Swamy claims that he made a statement regarding Adani’s Mumbai Airport acquisition. The post alleges that Swamy said, “The truth is that Adani did not buy these 74% shares from the Indian government but bought 74% from multiple foreign partners which Congress had sold in 2006!”. Let’s verify the claim made in the post. Claim: Subramanian Swamy stating that Adani did not acquire the 74% shares of Mumbai Airport from the Indian government, but instead purchased them from multiple foreign partners who Congress sold in 2006. Fact: These statements were not made by Dr Subramanian Swamy. In fact, Swami accused Adani of not repaying the loans and using nepotism to obtain stake in Mumbai Airport. Also, Adani Group has 74% stake in Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, post the stake purchase transaction, with 50.5% being bought from GVK Group and 23.5% Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), and Bidvest Group. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. During our investigation, we found that the same post was shared in 2021 when Adani Group acquired a 74% stake in Mumbai International Airport Limited. However, the statements were not attributed to Dr Subramanian Swamy at that time. We also searched through Swamy’s various social media accounts and also checked multiple media reports, but we could not find any evidence of him making the statement referred to in the social media post. However, during the process of Adani’s acquisition of Mumbai Airport from the GVK group in 2021, Swamy made allegations that Adani had not repaid the loans and had used nepotism to secure the Mumbai airport deal. Recently, during a Parliament speech on 07 February 2023, Rahul Gandhi made a series accusations against the Adani Group, stating that they were handed control of the Mumbai airport after it was taken away from the GVK. Dr Swami in an interview on 29 January 2023, while discussing the Hindenburg report on the Adani Group, once again accused Adani of using investigative agencies to pressure the GVK group into giving up control of the Mumbai Airport. However, the GVK group denied “extraneous pressure” from anyone to sell the Mumbai airport. Coming to Adani’s Mumbai Airport acquisition, as per the media reports, Adani Group has a 74% stake in Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, post the stake purchase transaction, with 50.5% being bought from GVK Group and 23.5% from minority partners including Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), and Bidvest Group. To sum it up, there is no conclusive evidence to support the assertion that Subramanian Swamy made any statements regarding the Adani Group and the Congress Party in relation to the Mumbai airport deal.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Famous fake/satire website The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense posted an article titled \"BREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem\" which opened: Donald Trump must have really gotten through to the NFL! After he tweeted on Sunday shaming owners for catering to PC culture while allowing players to disrespect our flag, our country, and our national anthem, everyone fell in line. The Pittsburgh Steelers thought it would be safe to take \"taking a knee\" to a whole new level by hiding in the locker room while the National Anthem played and everyone else showed reverence for OUR country but they didn't count on it being extremely costly. The article then links to a (real) ABC report about Pittsburgh Steelers players not coming out for the the national anthem during a game. The story then continued with some totally made up news: It was a bad decision. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who donated to Donald Trump's election campaign, announced shortly after the game began that every player who \"protested\" the National Anthem and showed \"immense disrespect to our nation\" would be fined a cool million dollars. No such thing happened. If you were thinking of praising or condemning Roger Goodell for this action, think again because you were taken in by fake news. The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense carries a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads: In a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today's busy conservative a place to go to read things they'll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with.

            "https://t.co/Dow4MmJ0TO #Kelowna pic.twitter.com/FKCQmiLM2E — Kelowna RCMP (@KelownaRCMP) January 19, 2021 The incident was first reported by Insider after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shared the conclusions of a years-long international drug investigation in a January 2021 news release. According to authorities, a local grocery store in the small British Columbia city of Kelowna reported that they had received 12 large bricks of what was thought to be illicit drugs in a shipment of bananas received in February 2019. That same day, authorities across the river in West Kelowna received a similar call from a grocer who found nine individually wrapped packages. It is thought that all 21 packages, each weighing about a kilogram, were sent to the western province by mistake from an origination point in Colombia. “Our investigation leads us to believe these illicit drugs were not meant to end up in the Central Okanagan, and arrived here in the Okanagan Valley as a result of a missed pickup at some point along the way,” said Jeff Carroll of the Kelowna RCMP Drug Section. The nearly two dozen packages were seized and analyzed by authorities who determined their contents contained nearly pure cocaine. Once cut with other agents, officials estimate that the 21 kilograms would have led to upwards of 800,000 doses of crack cocaine – enough to give each resident in the city of Kelowna almost six doses. “These two seizures in the BC southern interior no doubt saved precious lives across Canada,” wrote authorities. “The RCMP remains concerned and committed to interdicting any substance or product that may put the safety and security of Canadians at risk.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:A viral Instagram post claims that a court case about President Donald Trump allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl will begin on October 14. https://www.instagram.com/p/CGQIwtIhMAF The facts are these: in April 2016, an anonymous woman filed charges against Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, claiming the pair had subjected her to “sexual abuse under threat of harm” and “conspiracy to deprvive civil rights.” The suit was reportedly dismissed due to a filing error, but the plaintiff filed a similar suit in New York in June. That suit was then withdrawn after she failed to serve the complaint to either Trump or Epstein. The suit was filed again in late September, accusing Trump and Epstein of subjecting her “to acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress, duress, false imprisonment, and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury” in 1994. The plaintiff, who was 13 years old at the time the abuse is alleged to have taken place, said that she was promised “money and a modeling career” in exchange for attending parties hosted by Epstein. Trump attorney Alan Garten told Politico in September 2016 that the case “is categorically untrue. It is completely frivolous. It is baseless. It is irresponsible.” The case was voluntarily dismissed in November. While Trump was accused of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, the case was dropped before any trial began and such news is four years old. This Instagram post is false.\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Jacob Zuma's government has done \"a good job of stabilising the economy and investing in infrastructure to propel the economy into the next phase of growth, while investing in improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable\".This is one of the central claims made by Jeff Radebe – the Minister in the Presidency responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation – in a lengthy article defending the president's performance. It followed an attempt by an opposition party to introduce a motion of no confidence against Zuma.Radebe listed a number of achievements he attributed to the Zuma and the government. “This is not a political stunt,\" he wrote, \"this is no fiction; this is reality.\"Are his statements based on reality? Africa Check assessed them.(Note: Radebe’s office failed to respond to several requests for the source material on which he based his claims. A government spokesperson, Phumla Williams, also ignored calls and text messages. We have evaluated the claims by drawing on publicly available data and information.)VotingClaim “In 2014, more than 62% of South Africans made their democratic choice to choose a political party of their choice.” Verdict incorrectEconomic growthClaim “By the fourth quarter of 2014, GDP showed signs of recovery at a 4.1%. What is important, though, is that the real sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, were positive and actually grew.” Verdict misleadingEmploymentClaim “Whilst jobs were lost [due to the recession], in 2014 South Africa has actually managed to employ even more people than were employed in the years when jobs were lost, implying that there is recovery.” Verdict misleadingRenewable energyClaim “Under the stewardship of President Zuma, South Africa has one of the largest renewable energy programmes ranked among the top 10 in the world.” Verdict incorrectElectricityClaim “The percentage of households connected to the electricity mains increased from 82% to 85%.” Verdict correctWaterClaim “The percentage of households connected to piped water increased from 88% to 90%.” Verdict mostly-correctSanitationClaim “The percentage of households with access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 70% to 78%.” Verdict mostly-correctEducationClaim “The percentage of persons aged 20 years and above with no formal education or highest level of education less than Grade 7 within each gender group decreased from 19.3% to 16.2%.” Verdict correctLife expectancyClaim “South Africans now live nine years longer than they did in 2005 due to the roll-out by this government of drugs that prolong life.” Verdict correctStudent aidClaim “[The] National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) increased from R2.4 billion in 2008 to R9.5 billion in 2014.” Verdict mostly-correctPovertyClaim “South Africans benefit from a cocktail of social assistance programmes and services that alleviate poverty and indeed poverty has visibly been reduced since 2000.” Verdict correctState spendingClaim “South Africans have continued to trust government with their taxes. South Africa’s budget in 1994 was R135.1-billion; by 2004 this had doubled to R370-billion and R834-billion in 2009. The Minister of Finance recently announced a budget of R1.3-trillion. This means that since 2009 we have added more than the equivalent of the entire budget of 2004 and seen a 1,000% increase since 1994.” Verdict incorrectSouth Africa had a population of around 54-million people in 2014. According to the Independent Electoral Commission , an estimated 31.4-million people were eligible to vote in 2014 but only about 18.4-million people turned up to vote. The ANC garnered 11.4-million votes This means that 21% of all South Africans, or 36% of all eligible voters, voted for the ANC. Sixty two percent of all valid votes cast were for the African National Congress.Radebe is right on the numbers, but the financial quarter he chose to highlight paints a much brighter economic picture than is actually the case.The deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Francois Groepe, made the distinction in a recent address : “Although the South African economy expanded at a brisk annualised rate of 4.1% in the final quarter of 2014, growth for the full year was a disappointing 1.5% and represents the second-lowest growth rate recorded over the past sixteen years.” If you look at 2014 as a whole , the mining sector actually contracted by 1.6%, while the manufacturing industry showed no growth. Agriculture did increase by 5.6% percent.Radebe’s claim only deals with absolute labour statistics, that is, the actual number of people employed. In the fourth quarter of 2008 there were approximately 14.7-million people employed in the South African economy. By the third quarter of 2010 1.1-million jobs had been lost.Since then employment has increased. The most recent employment statistics show that 15.3-million people were employed in the fourth quarter of 2014 However, Radebe’s claim is misleading in that the unemployment rate has not recovered to pre-recession levels. Ratios are a better measure than absolute figures, the executive manager of labour statistics at Stats SA, Peter Buwembo, has told Africa Check.Prior to the recession the narrow unemployment rate was 21.5%. The latest statistics show the unemployment rate was 24.3% at the end of 2014.According to Kadri Nassiep, CEO of the state-owned South African National Energy Development Institute , “countries such as China, US and Germany still lead the way in total installed capacity”.He added that South Africa falls in the top 5 countries when the size of its renewable energy investment is compared to GDP. Uruguay, Mauritius and Costa Rica topped this ranking in the 2014 Global Status Report, compiled by international renewable network REN21.South Africa did make the top 10 list for investment in renewable energy in 2012 and 2013. The two most recent reports by Bloomberg New Energy Finance stated that South Africa invested $5.7-billion in renewable energy in 2012 and $4.9-billion in 2013 China was head and shoulders above the rest: investing $64.7-billion and $54.2-billion in those years. It already has an installed renewable energy capacity of 378GW , whereas South Africa aims for 6.7GW by 2016 and 17.8GW by 2030 The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of households connect to electricity mains increased from 82.7% in 2009 to 85.4% in 2013. The statistics for 2014 will be released around the middle of this year.The 2013 General Household Survey revealed that 89.9% of households had access to piped water, up from 89% when Zuma took office. Just over 4% of households had to fetch water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools and dams, wells and springs.But this one statistic does not provide the full picture about access to water in South Africa. In 2013 a quarter of households reported interruptions to their water supply that lasted more than 2 days at a time or lasted more than 15 days in total.Households also reported problems with the quality of water they received. In 2013 7.4% households (1.1-million) felt that their water was not safe to drink, 7.9% that their water was not clear, 8.8% that their water did not taste good whereas just over a million households (6.9%) felt that their water was not free from bad smells.The 2013 General Household Survey showed that access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 72.4% of households in 2009 to 77.9% of households in 2013. RDP standard sanitation includes flush toilets (either connected to a public sewerage system or a septic tank) or a pit toilet with a ventilation pipe.In 2013 62% percent of households had access to a flush toilet connected to either the public sewerage system or a septic tank. 15% has access to a pit latrine with a ventilation pipe and 16% has access to a pit latrine without a ventilation pipe.Four percent of households reported that they did not have access to sanitation of any kind. The survey noted that “the percentage of households that continued to live without proper sanitation facilities had been declining consistently between 2002 and 2013”.However, the general secretary of the Cape Town based Social Justice Coalition, Phumeza Mlungwana, told Africa Check that Radebe’s numbers lacked important context.“The claim doesn’t say anything about the condition of the toilet or the experience of using it or whether the toilet is functional and clean,” she said.For the first time, the 2013 General Household Survey included questions about problems experienced by households that share sanitation facilities. Statistics provided by Stats SA showed that 3,209,048 households (22.4%) reported sharing toilets facilities.The main problems these households experienced included poor hygiene (25.6%), poor lighting (25.1%), concern about physical safety while using the toilets (22%) and finding the toilet pit or chamber full (21.8%).The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of people aged 20 years and older who had no education, or had completed some primary school below grade 7, had decreased from 19.3% in 2009 to 16.2% in 2013.Radebe’s claim is supported by Stats SA’s 2014 mid-year population estimates . It showed that life expectancy increased by 9.1 years from 52.1 in 2005 to 61.2 years in 2014.Deputy executive director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute , Francois Venter, told Africa Check that the general consensus was that life expectancy in South Africa had been driven up by the rollout of antiretroviral therapy.“If you stop someone from dying in their 20s, 30s and 40s with ARVs, you bump up the average age at death significantly,” he said.“It is possible other things contributed – fresh water, less under-nutrition, expanded vaccine programmes – but that doesn’t cause such a dramatic change.”The National Student Financial Aid Scheme’s annual reports show that they provided funding worth R2.5-billion in 2008/09 A spokesman for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, Kagisho Mamabolo, told Africa Check that R9.2-billion worth of funding was provided in 2014. However, this excluded an additional R1-billion which was provided by the Department of Higher Education and Training to cover funding shortfalls in 2013 and 2014.The scheme provides funding to students that qualify according to a financial means test . Students are required to start repaying their loans once they start earning a salary of R30,000 or more per year, at an initial rate of 3% of their annual salary.Both students and universities have raised concerns that there is not enough funding to assist financially needy students. Earlier this year Wits University’s Student Representative Council was reported to have raised R2-million to assist students that did not receive funding from the scheme.Research by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit at the University of Cape Town, among others, showed that poverty as measured by income declined slightly between 1993 and 2012.To a large degree, the decline could be attributed to state spending on social grants, said Lauren Royston, director of research and capacity at the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI).Another tool whereby poverty can be measured showed an even greater reduction over this period . The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) takes into account more than income. It scores nine factors, such as school enrolment, nutritional levels and access to basic services that include electricity, sanitation and water.However, the index suffers from two limitations, former SERI researcher Michael Clark pointed out. First, it relies heavily on government statistics. The index also does not measure the quality of basic services.Despite the decrease achieved, Royston said South Africans must be mindful that poverty remains deep and widespread and that inequality has increased This claim is a bit nonsensical as it neither proves nor confirms anything, said the head of Wits University’s School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw. “One, we are compelled to pay taxes and two, to judge the budget in nominal terms doesn’t tell us much.”Rossouw said a more useful metric is to compare the budget with the gross national product (GDP) in a particular year. South Africa’s budget comprised 28.9% of GDP in the 1992/93 financial year , the highest this ratio was from 1993 to 2012. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12 it averaged 27.2%. In 2013 the ratio reached 33.2% There is a cause for concern when state expenditure grows faster than the economy, said Rossouw, as he has pointed out as co-author of a journal article before . However, state expenditure slowed in the fourth quarter of last year , giving some credence to the state’s promise to curb spending.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says under his utility rate plan, \"An estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones sees his plan to overhaul the city’s water and wastewater rates as a glass half full. His plan cuts in half the base rates that all customers pay simply to have access to the city’s water system. It also more than doubles a second charge to customers based on the amount of water they use and flush into the sewer system. \"Through this rate structure change, an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills,\" Jones said in a March 12 news release announcing the plan. We wondered if the mayor was correct. Under his plan, the monthly base rate charged to all customers for water and wastewater service would drop from $49.40 to $26.11. Meanwhile, the second monthly payment based on the volume of water used would rise from $4.22 to $9.03 for every 100 cubic feet that comes into their taps or leaves their home as wastewater. That 100 cubic feet, listed as a \"ccf\" on a resident’s water bill, amounts to about 750 gallons -- roughly 15 bathtubs full. The new rates are part of Jones’ proposal for a Richmond budget that is scheduled for a City Council vote May 13. Jones said his rates are not aimed at generating more revenues but were designed to shift more of the burden of supporting the utility to the residents who use the most water. Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, sent us a Department of Public Utilities chart breaking down the number of residential customers by their water use. The chart showed that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, the most recently completed budget cycle. That comes to about half of the city’s 51,832 residential customers. Another chart Hawley sent shows that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills. That’s because the increase in their volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate. People right at that 400 cubic foot threshold now pay $66.28 a month. The new rates would drop their monthly bills to $62.23 -- a savings of $4.05. The less water they use, the greater their savings. For example, customers who use 200 cubic feet would save $13.67 each month. Their monthly bills, now $57.84, would drop to $44.17. City charts show that the biggest savers would be the 13.7 percent of customers who use \"0 ccf\" a month. That doesn’t mean these households don’t use water, just that they consumed less than the 750 gallons threshold necessary to trigger a volume charge, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman with the Richmond Department of Public Utilities. So these users, who only pay the base rate, would save $23.29 a month. But 750 gallons is precious little water to use in a month. Such a household would be limited daily to a 5-minute shower, one tooth brushing, one hand washing and several toilet flushes and monthly to two loads of laundry and several dish washings, according to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey. We wondered if some of those households might be properties where no one is living but where someone still pays a water bill, such as a vacant apartment. Fountain said no one knows. \"If we’re sending them a bill, then we believe the property is occupied, that someone is using water there,\" she said. \"We can’t tell you how many people, how often they’re there. We just don’t have that information.\" So the mayor is correct that his plan cuts water and wastewater rates for half the city households. The unsaid part, of course, is that it raises rates for the other half -- those billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more. We should note that the average residential household uses 600 cubic feet in water and wastewater each month, according to Raftelis Financial Consultants, a group that examined the Richmond’s utility pricing in a March 2013 report. Such customers will see their bill rise from $74.72 to $80.29 -- a $5.57 increase. Our ruling The mayor said that under his plan, half of the city’s residences would see a drop in water bills. His carefully worded statement is accurate. The unspoken part is that 50 percent will see their bills increase. The mayor also omits that his proposal would lead to a modest rate hike for the average water user. The mayor is correct, but his statement benefits from additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Rudy Giuliani was seeking to make a point about socialized medicine by drawing upon his own experience of having been diagnosed with prostate cancer. But his statement caused an instant controversy as medical experts disputed his statistics and declared his comparison unfair. In fact, the numbers are wrong. According to the National Cancer Institute, the five-year survival rate in the U.S. actually is above 99 percent. In the United Kingdom, it's nearly 75 percent, according to their Office for National Statistics. Giuliani's campaign defends the numbers it used from City Journal, a quarterly magazine funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank in New York. \"The bottom line is, the mayor is illustrating a point that you are essentially better off in the U.S. system than the European system,'' said campaign spokesman Elliott Bundy. \"You are better off in a system of competition and choice rather than a government-mandated health care system.\" Cancer experts say there are two big problems with the City Journal article. For one thing, the numbers quoted in the story are an extrapolation of statistics from the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that supports health policy research, and that group says its numbers were misused in the City Journal article. The Commonwealth Fund issued a statement saying that its study of incidence of cancer and mortality rates should not be used to compute survivability rates. \"The numbers basically aren't right,\" said fund president Karen Davis. But a gap still exists in the five-year survival rate between the U.S. and the UK. Even if Giuliani's numbers are wrong, could his point still be right? No, according to cancer experts. The difference between the two countries comes down to a matter of medical philosophy, experts said. U.S. officials believe in aggressive testing to find early cases of prostate cancer, while some cancer experts say that since that many cases of prostate cancer develop late enough in life that patients are likely to die of something else, screening everyone for cancer isn't worth the difficulties those treatments can cause. U.S. men are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer as men in the U.K. because they are more likely to be screened for the disease. That artificially inflates the survival rate, since many of the U.S. men treated would never have developed symptoms of disease. A more accurate comparison would be to look at mortality rates, said prostate cancer epidemiologist Lorelei Mucci, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health.In the U.S., about 15.8 of every 100,000 men die of prostate cancer, while in the U.K., the figure is 17.9 deaths. \"They're essentially quite similar,\" she said. The statistics Giuliani uses are wrong. The Giuliani campaign insists that it's making a legitimate point about the merits of health care in the U.S. over Britain, but the statistics that say the chances of surviving prostate is higher in America also say the chances of having it are higher in the U.S., too. We find his statement false. \n",

            "[Evidences]:Hundreds of farmers in Haryana took to the streets against three agriculture-related ordinances passed by the Central government in June this year. Led by the Bhartiya Kisan Union, agitated farmers blocked National Highway-44 at Pipli near Kurukshetra on September 10, 2020. According to the government, these ordinances will make selling and purchasing agricultural produce easier for farmers and traders. The farmer organisations, however, are demanding legislation to ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP), fearing black marketing in the wake of these ordinances. Police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the protesting farmers in view of the violation of state administration’s Covid-19 protocols. While several images from Haryana's Kisan rally are viral on social media, one among them caught our attention. An image of a huge rally with a heavily packed crowd is shared with the claim that it is from the recent farmers protest in Haryana. The caption in Hindi to one such image uploaded on Twitter translates to English as, “Many farmers were beaten up, arrested. Many suffered head injuries. We will tolerate all of this. What we won't tolerate is an attack on our country's farms, diversity, and the price of our crops.” India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral image is from 2017 and not related to the ongoing farmers protest in Haryana. The image is from a protest held by more than 15,000 farmers in Rajasthan in 2017. Several netizens, including the Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union chief Gurnam Singh Charuni, also shared this viral image mixed with recent images from the Haryana protest on Facebook. The archived versions of similar posts using the viral image along with actual images from Haryana protests can be seen here, here, here and here. AFWA Probe With the help of a reverse image search, we found that the image in question is from a 2017 protest rally held by farmers in Rajasthan. The complete version of the same image is carried in an article published on September 4, 2017, by Jaipur-based Hindi news portal Patrika. According to the report, the image was part of a historic protest held by more than 15, 000 farmers against the then Vasundhara Raje-led government in Rajasthan in 2017. As per the report, the image shows farmers carrying out a funeral procession of the effigy of Vasundhara Raje around the city as part of the protest. A closer look at the highlighted portion on the top right corner of the original image published by Patrika shows the crowd carrying an effigy. Here is a comparison between the image in question and the original image uploaded by Patrika in 2017. Another article by Patrika published on September 30 also carried a similar image of the rally. We also found the same group of protestors in a video uploaded on the official YouTube channel of NewsClick on September 12, 2017. Multiple media organisations reported this massive indefinite agitation in Sikar that began on September 1, 2017. According to a report in Hindustan Times, protesting farmers had 11 demands, including increasing farmers’ pension, crop loan waiver, and purchase of crops at minimum support price (MSP) among others. It thus becomes clear that the viral image showing the massive rally is from Rajasthan’s Sikar taken in the year 2017 and has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ agitation in Haryana. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Image shows farmers protest in Haryana held on September 10, 2020, against three agriculture ordinances passed by the Central government. Conclusion The viral image is of a historic rally held in Rajasthan in 2017 when thousands of farmers protested against the then CM Vasundhara Raje-led government.

            "[Evidences]:The video has been viewed more than 80,000 times since it was posted on YouTube on March 11, 2021. Its Tagalog-language title translates as: “JUST IN: PULSE ASIA CONFIRMS VP LENI RECEIVED ‘ZERO’ VOTES IN MINDANAO / SEC. PANELO IS AMUSED!” The video shows presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo discussing the results of a voter preference survey for the 2022 national elections. The survey results Panelo discusses bears the logo of research organisation Pulse Asia. Vice President Leni Robredo, who currently leads the political opposition in the Philippines, is among the potential 2022 candidates listed in the survey. Comments to the post indicate people believed the survey pertained to the results of the 2016 election. One wrote: \"This also confirms (Ferdinand Marcos Jr) is the real winner for the VP election in Mindanao. Supreme Court are you not bothered that you made a wrong decision?” The video circulated weeks after the Supreme Court ruled in Robredo’s favour and dismissed an election protest filed by her 2016 vice presidential race opponent Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Marcos Jr had accused Robredo of electoral fraud, but a recount in tightly contested areas gave her a bigger lead, AFP reported. An identical video was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here; and in this blog post. However, the claim is misleading. Keyword searches on Google found the video corresponds to a longer video streamed live March 10, 2021 on the Facebook account of the Philippine presidential communications agency. The longer video shows Salvador Panelo presenting a Pulse Asia survey titled: “VOTER PREFERENCE FOR PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL TANDEMS FOR 2022.” He appears to mock Robredo for her survey performance in Mindanao island, where she is seen with a zero score. Nowhere in the video does Panelo mention that Pulse Asia confirmed Robredo received zero votes in Mindanao during the 2016 polls. Pulse Asia told AFP the survey is authentic, but denied it is about the 2016 elections as the misleading posts allege. In a phone interview on April 7, 2021, Pulse Asia chair Ronald Holmes said: “We don’t have anything in the survey that really would probe into what (the respondent’s) perception of the 2016 elections are.” “The survey is a commissioned survey. It was conducted this year.” Reports published in 2016 by media organisations Inquirer.net and GMA News Online also indicate Robredo did not get zero votes in Mindanao.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A video shows an election worker in Clark County, Washington, improperly closing a ballot drop box 30 minutes early, making a voter put their ballot in a bag instead.\n",
            "[Evidences]:CLAIM: A video shows an election worker in Clark County, Washington, improperly closing a ballot drop box 30 minutes early, making a voter put their ballot in a bag instead.AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The drop box was not closed and the election worker told the voter they could still deposit their ballot into the box if they did not wish to put it into the bag. Clark County election officials and the Washington Secretary of State’s office say election workers are able to collect ballots from voters near drop boxes to speed up the process, prevent the boxes from overflowing and to ensure that everyone who is in line can vote before the 8 p.m. deadline.THE FACTS: The video clip showing a drivers’ interaction with the election worker has circulated widely on social media since the local primary election last week.The footage was filmed by a driver who was in the queue to drop off a ballot at a transit center in unincorporated Clark County, near Vancouver, Washington. In the clip, the worker can be seen standing alongside the cars holding an open bag facing the drivers. The drop box is visible a little further down the road.The woman recording the video asks the election worker: “Why are you not allowing us to put them in the ballot box?” The worker responds by saying that it takes them roughly 25 minutes to retrieve all the ballots in the drop box and that they have to close it right at 8 p.m. The worker then says that the driver can still drop off their ballot at the box if they prefer.Many social media users claimed that the footage showed corrupt activity. One Twitter user wrote on Thursday, “Nothing to see here, just a darker shade of corrupt snatching of red votes: Clark County, WA collecting ballots in an open knapsack.”“ILLEGAL: Clark County election workers closed the ballot drop boxes 30 mins prior to closing,” another user falsely claimed.But the claims are misrepresenting the incident. The box was not closed, and the worker was providing extra collection support, which officials say is routine in the state. Washington state election law and administrative code permit election officials to accept ballots from voters at ballot drop boxes, Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey, who oversees elections in the county, and the secretary of state’s office said in separate statements to The Associated Press.The practice is intended to speed up the process and ensure that every voter who is in line to drop off a ballot at a designated site by 8 p.m. can do so, Kimsey said, adding that the county has historically experienced long lines at the end of election day.“By giving voters the option of depositing their ballot with an election administrator (who is clearly identifiable by their badge and vest) the line moves much more quickly enabling election administrators to identify the vehicle that is last in line at 8 p.m.,” Kimsey’s statement continued.All ballots, including those given directly to an election worker, are secured in official ballot bags and delivered to the elections office, Kimsey added. Election observers are also present at the end of election day at ballot drop boxes in Clark County, and there were “three certified election observers representing the Republican party” at the site when the video was recorded, he noted.Washington is among a handful of states that conduct all of their elections by mail, outside of one in-person voting center in each county. All registered voters are sent a ballot in the mail. The voter completes the ballot, places it in a secure inner envelope and then into a separate mailing envelope and signs an affidavit. The envelopes don’t display any party affiliation or voting choices. The voter then either mails off the ballot or returns it to a drop off location.Such drop off locations can be staffed or unstaffed. The Washington Secretary of State’s office confirmed that the actions captured in the video at a staffed drop location were permitted under laws and codes that aim to prevent the overflow of ballot boxes and allow for the collection of ballots in secure storage containers.“Election workers providing additional support, particularly when lines get long in order to expedite ballot submission, is not uncommon,” spokesperson Amy Lin wrote in an email.The office pointed to alaw on ballot drop boxesthat requires county auditors to prevent them from overflowing, saying that in this video, the election workers were following the law by ensuring that a long line of last minute voters wouldn’t overwhelm the drop box as the deadline approached.Stuart Holmes, Washington’s acting director of elections, also cited a section of thestate codeonsecure storage, which allows ballots to be placed in containers such as the bag pictured. The bag in the video appeared to be a ballot transfer carrier with the ability to be securely sealed, he said, adding that ballots from the drop box would also ultimately be placed into such containers.“When you combine those two statutes together it really amounts to making sure that people who are in their vehicles ⁠— which creates a massive line ⁠— are able to get through the line and process their ballot,” Holmes said.Washington Administrative Coderequires deposit site staff to “subscribe to an oath regarding the discharge of their duties,” and Holmes noted that there would be criminal consequences if any workers handled the ballots improperly.Patrick L. Schoettmer, a politics professor at Seattle University who researches voting behavior and regularly observes voting at local drop boxes, reviewed the video and confirmed that he didn’t see anything “abnormal or or out of order.”“That could strike me as being a legitimate acceptance of a ballot of someone who was already in line,” he added.___This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: COVID-19 cases are “down by 50%” and “daily vaccinations have increased by 85%” since “Biden took office”\n",
            "[Evidences]:CLAIM COVID-19 cases are “down by 50%” and “daily vaccinations have increased by 85%” since “Biden took office” more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Anonymous, Occupy Democrats, 16 Feb. 2021 DETAILS Lacks context: The claim suggested that the public health situation would have been different if Joe Biden hadn’t taken office by comparing the trends in COVID-19 cases and vaccination from the day of inauguration to the day of publication and by alluding to Biden’s competence. However, the claim didn’t look at the trends before Biden’s inauguration, which showed that they were similar before he took office. Factually inaccurate: According to the official data from the U.S. CDC, the daily number of vaccinations increased by 60% since Biden’s inauguration, not 85%. KEY TAKE AWAY The daily number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. fell sharply in January 2021. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign has been steadily ramping up since mid-December 2020. These data alone don’t provide evidence that Joe Biden taking office is having an impact, as the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases and the increase in the number COVID-19 vaccinations began weeks before Biden’s inauguration. The new presidency, while not expected to have any significant effects in the first weeks following inauguration, might materialize in future months and years. FULL CLAIM: COVID-19 cases are “down by 50%” and “daily vaccinations have increased by 85%” since “Biden took office” REVIEW The COVID-19 pandemic that swept across the U.S. since early 2020 has caused almost 28 million identified cases and 500,000 deaths in the country. In the midst of this major health crisis, the U.S. have seen an important political shift with the inauguration of Joe Biden on 20 January 2021, succeeding Donald Trump as U.S. president. Claims of significant improvement in the numbers of COVID-19 cases or vaccination rates circulated on social media, attributing the merit to the new administration. For example, this post by Occupy Democrats or this post by The Other 98% alleged that the number of new COVID-19 cases was down 50% and the number of daily vaccinations was up 85% since Biden took office. While data confirm that these trends are present, the numbers in the first example do not match the official figures. Furthermore, such claims are misleading as they don’t compare the trends in the number of new COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates before and after President Biden’s inauguration. Daily number of new COVID-19 cases significantly decreased in January 2021 and the number of vaccination increased The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the trends in the daily number of newly identified COVID-19 cases (Figure 1). From 20 January 2021—the day when Biden was sworn in—to 16 February 2021 when the Occupy Democrats meme was published, the average daily number of new cases fell steadily from 193,481 to 81,406 cases per day. This means that 4,000 fewer cases were identified on average each day over that 28-day period. Overall, this represents a 58% decrease, which is not far from the 50% figure cited in the meme. Figure 1. New identified COVID-19 cases reported by the CDC as of 19 February 2021. The blue bars represent the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases each day. The red curve represents the 7-day rolling average. Using a 7-day rolling average helps smoothing out the day-to-day variations. The vertical black line marks the inauguration of Joe Biden. However, the number of new cases is of little relevance if it is not viewed in context with the number of tests performed. Indeed, significantly reducing the number of tests would automatically reduce the number of reported cases. It is therefore important to also look at the positivity rate together with the number of cases. The positivity rate is the percentage of COVID-19 diagnostic tests that returned a positive result. The Johns Hopkins University gathered the data from 56 U.S. states and territories and presented a chart of these regions’ positivity rate over time (Figure 2). The positivity rate markedly decreased in 2021, from 9.7% on 20 January 2021 to 5.5% on 16 February 2021, or a reduction of 43%. Based on this analysis, there is a genuine decrease in cases and the decrease isn’t simply due to changes in the number of tests performed. Figure 2. Trends in the COVID-19 positivity rate over time, reported by the Johns Hopkins University as of 19 February 2021. The number of COVID-19 diagnostic tests carried out each day are represented in light orange and those which returned positive results in dark orange. The proportion of positive tests, or positivity rate, is shown as a blue curve. However, the daily number of vaccinations cited in the claim is less accurate. The CDC also presents the number of vaccinations performed per day (Figure 3). Owing to the important day-to-day variations—for example, there are less vaccinations occurring on Sundays—it is important to focus on the seven-day rolling average (red line) rather than on the daily counts. The available average numbers stop on 13 February 2021. As the CDC explained, data from the most recent days are incomplete and still need to be consolidated. During the 25-day period from 20 January 2021 to 13 February 2021, the daily number of vaccinations rose from 965,982 to 1,543,466 doses, up by 60%. While the positive trend in vaccinations is clear, the figure of 60% is very different from the 85% cited in the claims. Figure 3. Daily number of vaccinations performed each day reported by the CDC, as of 19 February. The light blue bars represent the number of doses administered each day. The dark blue bars represent incomplete data: there is a lag in the reporting of administered doses which means that the most recent days are still underreported. The red line represents the 7-day rolling average, which allows to smooth out the day-to-day variations. In general, the claims are accurate in stating that the number of new COVID-19 cases fell and the number of vaccinations steadily increased since the day when President Biden took office. However, analyzing the CDC data shows that the actual figures cited in these claims are inaccurate. The rise in vaccination number and the drop in COVID-19 cases began before President Biden’s took office The claims strongly suggested that the trends in new COVID-19 cases and vaccination is tied to Biden’s policies by using the day of his inauguration as the point of reference. This is apparent in this meme congratulating Biden and referring to his competence. However, in order to properly assess whether President Biden taking office had an impact on those numbers, it would be necessary to compare the variation of COVID-19 cases before and after Biden took office. When we conducted this analysis, we found that the observed trends already began before 20 January 2021. The CDC data showed that the number of daily new COVID-19 cases began dropping on 13 January 2021, one week before the inauguration (Figure 1). During that week, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases decreased from 243,799 to 193,481, which means that 6,289 less cases were identified each day. In fact, the rate at which cases fell was faster one week before the inauguration than during the period between 20 January and 16 February 2021. The positivity data from the Johns Hopkins University exhibited a similar pattern, with the positivity already decreasing since 8 January 2021 (Figure 2). This phenomenon is even clearer when it comes to vaccination. As shown by the CDC data, the 7-day rolling average of daily vaccinations has steadily increased since 14 December 2021. As mentioned earlier in this review, the daily number of vaccinations rose 60% during the 25-day period after President Biden took office. However, it actually rose 278% during a similar 25-day period right before the inauguration, from 27 December 2020 to 20 January 2021. That the daily number of vaccination rose rapidly in the early stages of the vaccination campaign but slowed down when the vaccination operation reached full capacity is unsurprising. Therefore, the slower rate at which vaccinations were performed doesn’t mean that vaccination efforts have weakened since Biden’s inauguration. But it cannot be suggested that the increase of daily vaccination since 20 January is causally associated with Biden taking office. In summary, COVID-19 cases are markedly decreasing in the U.S., while the daily rate of COVID-19 vaccination is steadily rising. However, the figures reported in the viral Facebook memes that we analyzed above are inconsistent with the data from the CDC. In addition, the data available so far don’t support the claim that the trends observed in the daily number of new cases and the number of vaccinations are causally associated with Biden taking office. The fall in the number of new cases and the rise in the number of vaccinations had already started before his inauguration, at a similar or even higher rate.\n",

            "[Evidences]:One of the most reliable Republican attacks on President Barack Obama has been that he and his allies in Congress are spending too much of the taxpayers' money. In his live-blogging response to Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, criticized Obama's handling of the federal budget by playing off Obama's proposed freeze on domestic spending.\"President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' \" Boehner wrote, \"but on his watch, nondefense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone.\"Analyzing the accuracy of this comment requires an immersion in budget wonkery. Specifically, determining whether Boehner is right depends heavily on whether you are talking about \"budget authority\" or \"outlays.\"When Congress approves budget authority, it confers the right to spend money for a certain purpose. But for various reasons, that money may not be spent during the fiscal year when it is authorized. For instance, a given program may take longer than expected to get up and running, employees may not be hired immediately, or, most commonly, lawmakers may intend for the spending to be made in subsequent years. The actual money spent in a given year is referred to as \"outlays.\"Let's look at the the various ways to calculate the numbers that Boehner cited.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in fiscal year 2008 -- the last year under President George W. Bush -- was $494 billion. (Discretionary spending refers to funds appropriated on an annual basis by Congress, while mandatory spending -- a separate category -- includes required programs such as Social Security, as well as interest on the federal debt.)The budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in 2009 -- including budget authority from the 2009 stimulus bill -- was $803 billion. That's an increase of about 63 percent -- quite close to what Boehner's blog post suggested.But not all the budget authority conveyed by the stimulus bill was exercised in 2009. In fact, of the $268 billion in budget authority conveyed for 2009, only about $35 billion was actually spent in 2009, orroughly 13 percent of the total budget authority.So if you remove from the calculations the unspent budget authority from the stimulus -- sticking instead to the nondefense discretionary outlays in both the regular budget and the stimulus -- the increase from 2008 to 2009 was 11.3 percent. That's quite a bit less than what was suggested by Boehner's blog post.\"It's very misleading,\" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He said Boehner essentially took more than one year's expenditures and counted them in a single year. We talked to Boehner's office, and staffers acknowledged that the congressman's phrasing could have been more accurate. But they maintained that their larger point holds.\"Congressional Democrats voted to increase spending by 67 percent,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. \"That’s the way the American people understand it. You can quibble about the arcana of budget wonk terminology, but they voted to spend the money, and we’re very comfortable using that figure.\"Boehner gets some outside backup. Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that calculating budget authority is not totally out of left field. It's a \"measure of congressional intent,\" he said.But because Boehner wrote that nondefense spending \"has spiraled out of control,\" to use numbers that refer to budget authority are, at best, misleading. In this case, the difference between those two methods isn't trivial, thanks to the unusual circumstances of a massive, multiyear spending bill being passed in 2009. In essence, calculating it Boehner's way turns a comparatively modest spending increase into a whopping one. For that reason, we rate his statement Barely True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: “Donald Trump himself wrote a book where he was talking about the need to increase the age of eligibility for Social Security to 70.”\n",
            "[Evidences]:Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have vowed to protect Social Security while accusing each other of wanting to cut the program for older Americans. A pro-Trump political action committee ad pointed to DeSantis’ votes to raise the retirement age as a member of Congress, though he no longer holds that view. A Newsmax reporter asked DeSantis on May 5 to respond to the PAC attack, and he said Trump held a similar position. \"Donald Trump himself wrote a book where he was talking about the need to increase the age of eligibility for Social Security to 70 and said people shouldn’t be worried about retiring, just keep working,\" DeSantis said. \"That's what his words were.\" Today, people can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits at age 62, but full benefits kick in when those people turn 67. When we looked into Trump’s book, we found that DeSantis got it mostly right about Trump pushing to raise the age. A DeSantis spokesperson pointed to CNN’s April 27 article that recounted what Trump said in his book about Social Security. Spokespeople for Trump did not reply for this fact-check. Trump announced his bid for the presidency in November while DeSantis may announce this summer. Trump co-wrote the book \"The America We Deserve,\" which was published in January 2000 as he considered a bid for president as a Reform Party candidate. Weeks later, Trump said he wouldn’t run, declaring the Reform Party a \"total mess.\" Fiscal responsibility was one of the book’s themes, and Trump warned that the Social Security trust fund would run out by 2030. (More than two decades later, the expected depletion date is 2034, barring congressional action.) \"There is no Social Security Trust Fund any more than there is a Tooth Fairy,\" Trump wrote. \"The fund exists only as a bookkeeping device.\" Trump said there was a way out by making changes to the program, such as allowing people to invest Social Security payments in real estate portfolios, stocks or bonds. He also said older adults should not be penalized if they want to continue working. On raising the retirement age, Trump wrote: \"We can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy.\" He explained the age limit would not affect beneficiaries: \"This proposal would not include anyone who is currently retired or about to retire. Don’t put your water skis back in the basement; it would be set for those who would retire well into the third or fourth-decade of the twenty-first century. A firm limit at age seventy makes sense for people now under forty. We’re living longer. We’re working longer. New medicines are extending healthy human life. Besides, how many times will you really want to take that trailer to the Grand Canyon?\" When Trump ran for president in the 2016 race, he flip-flopped on raising the retirement age. In an August 2015 interview, Fox News’ Sean Hannity asked Trump about raising the retirement age. Trump replied: \"No, I wouldn't.\" During a Republican primary presidential debate in 2016, Trump said, \"It’s my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age, and to leave it as is.\" In a March 2023 speech to the Conservative Action Political Conference, Trump appeared to allude to DeSantis’ old views on Social Security, saying, \"We're not going back to people that want to destroy our great Social Security system, even some in our own party, I wonder who that might be, that want to raise the minimum age of Social Security to 70, 75, or even 80 in some cases.\" When DeSantis was a U.S. representative, he voted for a 2013 budget resolution that proposed raising the Social Security and Medicare retirement age to 70. DeSantis had said he wanted to make the programs \"financially sustainable\" for younger generations. More than a decade later, and ahead of a possible GOP presidential primary, DeSantis walked back that stance, telling Fox News in early March that he would not \"mess with\" entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. DeSantis said, \"Donald Trump himself wrote a book where he was talking about the need to increase the age of eligibility for Social Security to 70.\" Trump’s 2000 book stated, \"We can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy. This proposal would not include anyone who is currently retired or about to retire.\" Though in his book, Trump did propose raising the age for full Social Security benefits to 70, this has not been his position for years. DeSantis also left out details about how Trump’s old proposal would work. We rate this statement Mostly True. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check.

            "claim [Claim]: After the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised in Maine, the state \"reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:New York state leaders are thinking about raising the minimum wage for workers who earn tips in addition to their hourly rate. Sen. James Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady County, says that idea didn’t work when it was tried in Maine two years ago. \"The state of Maine passed an initiative that abolished the tip credit,\" Tedisco wrote in a blog post, \"but less than a year later reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure after they saw a significant decrease in earnings.\" The state Department of Labor will decide later this year whether to end a practice that allows employers to pay tipped employees less than the state’s minimum wage. Tedisco is against the idea, saying it could do more harm than good for the state’s restaurant industry. He says restaurant workers in Maine were able to reverse an identical proposal in their state. Is he right about what happened? What’s happening in New York state The state Department of Labor is holding hearings across the state through June to consider raising the minimum wage for tipped workers. The proposal would not ban tipping. Tipped workers currently make between $7.50 and $10.85 an hour without tips depending on where they live and the industry they work in. The minimum wage for everyone else varies between $10.40 and $13.50 based on location and industry. Tips are meant to make up the difference between what tipped workers earn and the statewide minimum wage. Employers have to fill the gap if tips do not. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo believes the proposal may help employees who struggle to make the minimum wage with tips. If the Department of Labor agrees, the agency can raise the minimum wage for tipped employees without approval from voters or the state legislature. They already did once in 2015. What happened in Maine Maine tried to do the same thing in 2016 — sort of. In a 2016 ballot initiative, Maine approved increasing the state’s minimum wage as well as gradually raising the minimum wage for tipped workers until it reached $12 in 2024. The measure passed by a slim margin. By the time the new minimum wage took effect at the start of 2017, restaurant workers had already organized a campaign to restore the lower wage for tipped workers. They argued that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave a tip. Fear became reality for many workers, according to Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, who co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to opposethe wage increase. \"Individuals were coming into our restaurant and simply asking us, ‘You make minimum wage, do you still think I should tip the same percentage?’ \" Chaisson said. He was one of hundreds of restaurant owners and workers who showed up at the state capitol in Maine that April for a public hearing on the wage increase. \"Several of us had brought pay stubs forward from the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 showing we had actually lost money in the same identical quarter from year to year,\" Chaisson said. In June 2017, the Maine legislature passed a new law making theminimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. One of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Roger Katz, gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law. \"Hundreds of restaurant workers have spoken, and we have listened,\" Katz said in a statement. \"Over the session it has become abundantly clear that those working in the restaurant industry overwhelmingly favor the tip credit system.\" Our ruling Tedisco said the measure raising the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maine was reversed in less than a year. Tedisco is right. Voters in Maine raised the minimum wage for tipped workers through a ballot initiative. State lawmakers reversed that decision less than a year later after pressure from restaurant workers who were against the wage increase. We rate his claim True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:One theme U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris sounds in her 2020 presidential campaign is that \"justice is on the ballot.\" The California Democrat did so repeatedly in a Facebook video ad, which leads off with this claim: \"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.\" Her statement is based on a study that produced startling headlines, such as one in the Washington Post: \"For the first time in history, U.S. billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class last year.\" But Harris misfired by making her claim about taxes paid instead of tax rates. Also, the study, while produced by two prominent economists, makes estimates based on assumptions that are not universally accepted among economists. The study, published as a book about a month before Harris’ claim, was done by leading economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, whose work PolitiFact has relied on for previous fact-checks. Harris’ campaign told us Harris was referring to rates, even though that isn’t what Harris said. The study said that in 2018, the average effective tax rate paid by the bottom half of American households was 24.2% — a full percentage point higher than the 23% rate paid by the 400 richest families. As the book puts it, \"the Trumps, the Zuckerbergs and the Buffetts of this world pay lower tax rates than teachers and secretaries.\" So, to use Harris’ example, a typical father with two jobs pays a higher tax rate than the richest 400 American families — according to one study by prominent economists. That’s not the same as paying more taxes. Indeed, an individual with $1 million in taxable income would pay roughly $230,000 in all federal and state taxes, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us. Someone with $50,000 in taxable income would pay about $12,000. Moreover, the study Harris relied on makes estimates for 2018, and its methodology has come in for criticism from some economists. That isn’t to say that the study is wrong or that the critics are right. But the picture isn’t as clear as Harris’ statement suggests. Federal tax data for 2018 were not available, so the Saez-Zucman study had to do extrapolations, Gleckman wrote in a critique of the study. That is \"no easy feat,\" because of fundamental changes made by the 2017 Republican tax cuts; plus, the study excluded certain federal tax credits received by lower- and middle-income people. The upshot, according to Gleckman: Incomes of the very rich are rising faster than for all other income groups, and Trump’s tax law cut the taxes of high earners by more on average than for low- and moderate-income households; \"but that doesn’t mean that billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class.\" A similar criticism was made by economists Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute and Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation. The Saez-Zucman study, they wrote, \"rests on several unconventional methodological assumptions which, in our opinion, biases the outcome towards finding relatively lower tax rates on the wealthy compared to the poor and overstates the decline in top earners’ tax burdens.\" David Splinter, an economist at Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, also found fault with the Saez-Zucman study’s methodology and conclusion that tax rates are nearly equal for people at opposite ends of the income scale. The joint committee, the Tax Policy Center, the U.S. Treasury, the Congressional Budget Office and economists all have found that federal taxes are progressive, he wrote in a critique of the study. The study’s assumptions, Tax Foundation economist Erica York told us, \"go against the widely-accepted methods that exist for determining tax burdens, without providing a convincing reason for doing so.\" Saez referred us to a frequently asked questions web page that explains the study’s rationale and addresses some of the criticism. University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky praised the study, but called Harris’ claim misleading. \"In dollar terms, the father holding down two jobs is certainly paying less in taxes than the taxes paid by the richest families,\" Reschovsky told us. \"What Harris should have said, is that the father holding down two jobs is paying a larger share of his income in taxes than the average richest families are paying in taxes relative to their incomes.\" But, again, that scenario comes from a study that is in some dispute. Harris said, \"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.\" The study Harris relies on estimates that a typical taxpayer pays a higher tax rate on federal, state and local taxes — not that he pays more in actual taxes — than do the richest families. And even on rates, the difference is not especially large: 24.2% vs. 23%. That’s important because, while the study was done by leading economists, it relies on estimates and a methodology that some economists say makes the tax system look less progressive than it actually is. Most critically, there is nothing in Harris’ ad that suggested she was talking about tax rates rather than taxes paid. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Harris a Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:About this rating While the giant penis appeared in the grass of a historic lawn in Bath, England, it was unclear who did it or whether it was related to the planned coronation parties for King Charles on May 6, 2023. In what some may describe as a major dick move ahead of the May 6, 2023, coronation of King Charles, someone created a large outline of a giant phallus at a park in Bath, England. According toreports, the erect penis outline was 30-feet-long and seemingly appeared overnight, noticed by local residents on May 4. This was indeed a real outline of a giant penis cut into the lawn of the historic Royal Crescent row of houses, considered to be an important example of Georgian-era architecture. However, officials apparently don't know who did it, or why, though a number of parties and picnics had been planned in the area to mark the coronation of King Charles. Aerial visuals of the penis appeared on SomersetLive, a local news outlet.The giant penis caused quite a stir, leaving residents \"shocked,\" according to SomersetLive. Other residents shared photographs of it from different angles, some describing it as \"very funny.\" Historian and resident Kirsten Elliot Swift said in her tweets, \"@Bathlive thinks [the phallus is] mown but it looks more like carefully applied herbicide.\" She shared photographs from the scene, largely taken from the tip of the phallus. Speaking to us via Twitter messages, Elliot Swift wrote, \"The odd thing was how symmetrical it was and how straight the lines were.\" She also pointed out that the grass in the shape was \"browning,\" leading some to believe that weedkiller had been used to create the shape. Another Twitter user, \"PDouble0k,\" shared the following photographs from the site, tweeting, \"Royal Crescent at its finest.\" \"PDouble0k\"even posted a follow-up taken from the bottom of the phallic image: Speaking to us via direct message, she sent another photograph with her shadow included. (Twitter/PDouble0k) She confirmed to us that the shape was still present in the grass when she went there around midday on May 5. However, according to a Bath-area Facebook group Born & Bred or Live in the City of Bath, the Bath & North East Somerset Council (B&NES Council) sent teams to remove it. Facebook user Mark Foster wrote, \"[B&NES] had their top team working on it this morning. The joke doesn't really work at ground level, it's a prank for the drone generation.\" Somerset Live reached out to the Crescent Lawn Company, which is responsible for maintaining the grass in a section above the lawn where the penis was visible. A spokesperson said, \"The Crescent Lawn Company owns and maintains only the semi-elliptical area above the ha-ha on behalf of the residents of the street; the area below (i.e. south of) the ha-ha is part of the Royal Victoria Park, which is owned and maintained by B&NES Council.\" We reached out to the B&NES Council to learn more about the penis — how it was done, who could be responsible, and whether it had been removed. We will update this story if we get more information.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A screenshot of an alleged report attributed to CNN entitled “Donald Trump dead at 76” has duped some social media users. The content is fabricated and is part of a hoax circulating about the former president. A spokesperson for CNN, Emily Kuhn, said the image was fabricated, telling Reuters: “CNN did not report this.” An iteration posted by a verified Twitter user has been retweeted over 1,700 times (here). Although some acknowledge the report was not real, others appeared confused. “I thought this was a joke. What a way to go. See you in hell, my man,” one Twitter user commented. No such article came up when searching on the CNN website (here) or verified Twitter handles @CNN and @CNNbrk (here). The screenshot is likely an altered version of an analysis by CNN Editor-at-large Chris Cillizza, which includes the same cover photo of Trump (here). The authentic piece, published on Nov. 1, carries the headline “Donald Trump joins the Paul Pelosi conspiracy caucus” instead and unlike the fabricated screenshot, the cover photo does not include a description. Reuters found no evidence indicating Trump died and the claim appears to have originated as satire. Newsweek traced the possible origin of the hoax, which started spreading on Nov. 1, to tweets from comedian Tim Heidecker (here). “Comedy is back on @Twitter,” Heidecker wrote in a tweet linking to the Newsweek article (here). The earliest iteration of the image Reuters could identify was posted by Twitter user “@mylifeisabiglie” (here) in response to a tweet by Heidecker.\n",

            "[Evidences]:In early May 2022, after the leak of a U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion revealed that the justices were set to overturn Roe v. Wade, social media users claimed that U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., once said it’s worth losing a pregnant mother’s life if it means saving an unborn fetus. However, no evidence corroborated the accusation, and a spokesperson for the senator told us he never said those words. Among the posts that falsely attributed the sentiment to Cramer was the above-displayed tweet. Thousands of Twitter users retweeted or favorited it, and according to screenshots captured by Business Insider reporter Grace Panetta, that included Rubén Gallego, a Democratic congressman from Arizona. He retweeted, and then deleted his retweet. An example of how rapidly a false claim can spread in the internet and even be amplified by a member of Congress. Stay safe out there, and check with congressional and/or local reporters before RTing an unsourced quote attributed to a lawmaker bc there’s gonna be a lot of that pic.twitter.com/Xgd7hXD1YF After searching for news articles about Cramer, we found no record of his having ever said those words, or expressed the same sentiment in different words, in any interview or speech. Additionally, in an email to Snopes, Cramer’s spokesperson Molly Block confirmed that he never made the alleged comment. For those reasons, we rated the claim “False.” Also, Block said, while Cramer has an anti-abortion stance, he supports exceptions in cases where a pregnancy must be terminated to save the mother’s life. “Senate Cramer is pro-life and that means standing for ALL life, which inherently includes the child and the mother,” Block wrote. “If Roe were to be reversed, North Dakota has a trigger law in place, which includes exceptions for [the] life of the mother, and rape/incest. Senator Cramer is supportive of this.” As we noted above, the fake comment attributed to Cramer spread amid controversy over a leaked Supreme Court draft decision, obtained by Politico and published on May 2, 2022.

            "claim [Claim]: A video shows a \"reptilian shape shifter\" guarding former U.S. President Barack Obama during a 2013 speech.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Advertisment: About this rating There's a saying that the internet never forgets, and that's certainly true of old conspiracy theories that refuse to die. One such example is a video of a bald U.S. Secret Service agent with strong bone structure who conspiracy theorists since 2013 have accused of being a reptilian shape shifter. The video, as of this writing, is nearly a decade old. It stems from a speech given by former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2013 at a March 4, 2013, policy conference held by the lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee, also known by its acronym AIPAC. In the video, conspiracy theorists zoom in on the Secret Service agent and accuse him of being a reptile, which could not have helped that individual's self-esteem. The conspiracy theory cropped up in December 2022 in a widely viewed Instagram video: \"This was the day that the government was caught with a reptilian Secret Service agent in HD and they didn't deny anything,\" the video's host intones. But the video and underlying conspiracy theory — that the U.S. government hid a reptilian man in plain sight but also tried to hide that it did so— is of course contradictory and relies on a well-worn conspiracy theory about shape-shifting lizard people. It raises such obvious questions as: If the government was trying to hide its reptilian agents, why put one in a highly visible position at a televised event? If reptilians are capable of shape-shifting to look like humans, why not just shape-shift into something less obvious, like a table or chair? Do shape-shifting reptilians get full pay and benefits as government employees? In the Instagram video, the host claims that the government \"didn't deny anything\" about the claim that a reptilian was guarding Obama during his 2013 AIPAC speech. This claim is based on a screenshot of a March 2013 story published by technology news site Wired. The story contains a tongue-in-cheek quote fromCaitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, in which she refers to Obama-era budget cuts referred to as sequestration: I can't confirm the claims made in this video, but any alleged program to guard the president with aliens or robots would likely have to be scaled back or eliminated in thesequester,I'd refer you to the Secret Service or Area 51 for more details. In the context of the Wired story, that response was not so much a lack of denial as an unserious response to an unserious question. Wired was asking the White House about shape-shifting aliens guarding the president, after all. And the article concludes with this deadpan paragraph: But still: alien guards. They've gotten a raw deal through the sequester. The White House didn't clarify if its reptilian Secret Service agents are subject to the furloughs without pay affecting federal employees. But say this for the automatic budget cuts: They may have prevented Obama from falling into the clutches of an intergalactic conspiracy -- that is, if the president wasn't in on it from the start. In other words, the White House's response can't be read as a refusal to deny, but instead seems to fit with the overall sardonic tone of the Wired piece. It was an attempt at humor over an outlandish claim that some have since taken seriously. The Instagram host claims that he \"literally looked for the video everywhere and couldn't find it, the only place it exists now is Reddit,\" referring to the popular message board-style social media platform. The video hasn't been taken down. It may no longer be available in old news stories about it, like the Wired story, perhaps because the story is now almost 10 years old and hasn't been updated. But the video is still available on YouTube, and also, clearly, Reddit, and on the Instagram post. If the government is trying to hide the video it is doing a very inadequate job. The \"reptilian\" conspiracy theory has been floating around for years, with one of its more prominent promoters being David Icke. The conspiracy theory posits that a race of reptilians is secretly controlling the world, pulling the strings in major human atrocities like the Holocaust. Icke, who is English, has been barred from holding events in countries like the Netherlands and Germany over anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. There is no basis for this claim about the Secret Service agent, and he isn't a member of a reptilian race— he simply appears to be tall and slender and with a strong facial bone structure. Although the Instagram video claimed he had \"green\" skin, there is no evidence that any such tint was present in real life, as opposed to an effect created by lighting, the camera, or even editing. Aside from the conspiracy theory about reptilian shape-shifters controlling the world, the idea of human-like creatures with reptile features is a common scientific trope. For example, the original \"Star Trek\" series featured a reptilian race called the Gorn.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Who knows where some political ideas originate. Any anonymous person can post a statement on the Internet. It can be passed around, repeated, added to and commented on in blog after blog. It can be circulated in chain e-mails. And pretty soon it gathers such steam, its very reach seems to add credibility. Here, we deal with just such an idea. It's the claim that the Free Flow of Information Act of 2009 passed by the House in March is actually a \"stealth\" law aimed at protecting President Barack Obama from having to produce his \"actual\" birth certificate. That's why some conservative bloggers derisively call it the \"Obama Birth Certificate Protection Act.\" Readers sent us an e-mail that claimed the bill \"would guarantee Barack Obama will never be held accountable for producing forged birth documents.\" Most versions call for readers to contact their local legislator to oppose the bill, which has been introduced in the Senate. As for the claim that Obama produced \"forged\" birth documents, that's a matter we have been following for quite some time, and we direct your attention here . In this item, we wanted to set the record straight about the Free Flow of Information Act. Passed by the House in March, the bill is designed to protect journalists from having to reveal confidential sources in federal court. Here's what the bill says: \"A federal entity may not compel a covered person to provide testimony or produce any document related to information obtained or created by such covered person as part of engaging in journalism, unless a court determines by a preponderance of the evidence.\" You can read the bill in its entirety here . Many bloggers insist it would also protect federal employees of the executive branch from being compelled to release documents. But the key words are \"covered person.\" And this is how it's defined later in the bill: \"The term 'covered person' means a person who regularly gathers, prepares, collects, photographs, records, writes, edits, reports, or publishes news or information that concerns local, national, or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public for a substantial portion of the person's livelihood or for substantial financial gain and includes a supervisor, employer, parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of such covered person.\" In other words, \"a covered person is simply a journalist,\" said Sophia Cope, legislative counsel for the Newspaper Association of America, which has lobbied hard for the bill. \"The White House would not fall under that.\" This bill has been kicking around Congress for four years, long before Obama announced his candidacy for president. The idea that it is a covert attempt to block Obama from producing his birth certificate is absurd. We also note that the bill has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support. It was so noncontroversial it passed the House on March 31 with a voice vote rather than a roll call. Last Congress, it passed by a vote of 398-21. A Senate version of the bill is under consideration. Cope isn't quite sure how the intent of the law has been so grossly distorted. \"The bill's intent is to protect reporters and their confidential sources from being subpoenaed to testify, or from having to disclose the identity of those sources,\" Cope said. \"I don't see how it would relate to Obama's birth certificate.\" One could argue that this law has simply been misread by some well-intentioned government watchdogs. But this is just the latest conspiracy theory from the fringe of a conservative group convinced that Obama hasn't provided sufficient documentation to prove he was born in the United States, and therefore cannot serve as president. Even among these folks, the claim about the Free Flow of Information Act is more than a stretch. We give it a Pants on Fire.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Three mass shootings were meant to distract from Hillary Clinton controversies.\n",
            "[Evidences]:People often claim that horrific tragedies are staged to distract attention from other news stories. When doing so, it’s wise to check the dates first. A June 14 Facebook post shared by conservative rocker Ted Nugent shows a screenshot implying that three separate mass shootings were timed to distract from various controversies involving former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But a simple Google search shows that the timelines between the shootings and the stories involving Hillary Clinton don’t closely match. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what the post says: — \"Remember when Hillary was testifying about Benghazi? Probably not. You were too busy watching the elementary school massacre in Connecticut.\" — \"Remember when Hillary got tattled on by Blumenthal for using illegal servers in the White House? Probably not. You were too busy watching the Charleston church shooting.\" — \"Remember that time Hillary’s campaign lawyer went to trial for lying to the FBI about Trumps-Russia collusion? Probably not. You’re too busy watching the Uvalde school shooting massacre.\" Let’s address the claims one by one. The first reference is to Clinton’s testimony about the attack on Sept. 11, 2012, by Islamic militants on U.S. sites in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Clinton testified before Congress on two separate occasions about the attack. The first was on Jan. 23, 2013, when she testified separately before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 2014, the House established a select committee to further investigate the attack. Clinton, a leading candidate at the time for president, again testified before Congress on Oct. 22, 2015, in a lengthy hearing that was carried live on major news networks and drew wide coverage. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, where gunman Adam Lanza first killed his mother, then traveled to the school to kill 20 children and six adults before killing himself, happened on Dec. 14, 2012. That’s over a month before Clinton’s first Benghazi testimony and nearly three years before her 2015 testimony. Another claim is a reference to the news that Clinton used a private email address instead of a government account during her time as secretary of state. That news first gained widespread attention after an article in The New York Times on March 2, 2015, but according to The Washington Post, the details first came out in 2013, when a hacker named \"Guccifer\" leaked emails from Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime friend of Clinton who worked as an adviser to President Bill Clinton. The website The Smoking Gun mentioned Clinton’s use of a private email address in its 2013 report about emails sent to her by Blumenthal. The FBI opened an investigation on July 10, 2015, and news coverage of it dogged Clinton for much of her campaign, even after then-FBI Director James Comey announced on July 5, 2016, there would be no charges. On June 17, 2015, a white supremacist named Dylann Roof killed nine Black people during a Bible study at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The shooting happened more than three months after news of Clinton’s private email address first gained widespread attention, three weeks before the FBI announced its investigation, and more than two years after Blumenthal’s emails were first leaked by a hacker. Jury selection began on May 16, 2022, for Michael Sussmann, a Democratic attorney who represented Hillary Clinton’s campaign. He was facing charges that he lied to the FBI by saying he was not working on behalf of a particular client when he gave the FBI information about possible ties between Donald Trump’s campaign and a Russian bank. He was acquitted on May 31 after a two-week trial. On May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos walked into Robb Elementary school in Uvalde and killed 19 students and two teachers. That shooting took place eight days after Sussman’s trial began. The recent tragedy in Uvalde prompted a flurry of misinformation online, much of which PolitiFact has already debunked. Such theories are common after mass shootings, and people often make fantastical claims that they are false flags meant to further an agenda like gun control or to distract from another news event. A Facebook post implied that three separate mass shootings — Sandy Hook, Charleston and Uvalde — were timed to distract from various controversies involving Hillary Clinton. There’s no evidence to suggest any of the shootings were staged. And the timing of the shootings do not match up with the events from which they were supposedly meant to distract. Nugent already has two Pants on Fire ratings from us. This ridiculous claim makes it three: Pants on Fire!\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says the 2014-15 state budget \"cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In a video announcing his run for lieutenant governor June 27, 2013, state Sen. Dan Patrick said that border security is a federal responsibility but Texas’ problem, and the state shouldn’t budget less for it. \"This year’s budget, despite increasing nearly 9 percent, actually cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs,\" the Houston Republican said. \"It was one of the reasons I voted against the budget.\" In a recent PolitiFact check, we found that state spending (aka general revenue) rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Did that include cuts to combating gangs and securing the border? Analysis showed us that wasn’t exactly so -- in fact, budgeted border spending rose about $118 million. Border security has been a fiscal priority for Gov. Rick Perry, who has urged state efforts to supplement federal border operations starting in 2005. In 2010, he said those efforts had decreased border crime 60 percent, a claim we rated as Pants on Fire largely because its basis was crime in rural areas only, excluding towns and cities. Texas’ border security efforts, according to an April 2013 issue brief from the Legislative Budget Board staff, began with state programs funded by federal grants in 2005-2007, followed by lawmakers signing off on $124 million in state spending from 2008-09 through 2012-13. State border operations are coordinated by the Governor's Office of Homeland Security within the Department of Public Safety, it said. The state created centers in the border area and Austin to gather intelligence, built a crime laboratory in Laredo, used software to map criminal activities in real time and coordinated federal, state, local and private law enforcement, the brief said, and also bought six aircraft, six patrol boats and 326 patrol vehicles. Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that Patrick’s claim referred to three specific categories of DPS spending in the biennial budget: \"organized crime,\" \"border security\" and \"local border security.\" Spence emailed us summaries from the budget board, which advises lawmakers on state funding issues, giving the amounts appropriated for those categories in the past two budgets sent to Gov. Perry. The summaries, from Sept. 7, 2011, and May 20, 2013, showed all-funds spending, meaning state plus federal and other funds: \"Organized crime\" -- $17.4 million drop, from $134.6 million to $117.2 million. \"Border security\" plus \"local border security\" -- $6.1 million drop, from $89 million to $82.9 million. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us via email that those changes were attributable to funds being moved to different areas within the department, plus \"one-time big ticket items\" under border spending and revised estimates for items such as federal grants in the \"organized crime\" spending. Spence had also sent us budget board summaries that wrapped in border operations conducted under Texas Parks and Wildlife and Trusteed Programs in the Governor’s Office. Those summaries, from May 2011 and June 2013, indicated that all-funds border security spending in those programs plus the DPS \"border/\"local border\" categories went from $219.5 million in 2012-13 to $94.1 million in 2014-15 -- indicating a drop of $128.1 million. Then again, the June 2013 summary also said \"additional funding is provided\" to DPS for border security above the $94.1 million total. Including that unspecified spending, the budget allocates more than $100 million to border security operations not spelled out in those estimates, we heard from a chief budget-writer and the staff of the board that advises lawmakers on spending issues Budget board staff spokesman John Barton told us via phone that by July 15, 2013, the board had estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS’ budget: $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget. That total suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency’s revised 2012-13 border security budget total of $212.9 million. Vinger confirmed the amounts in the July 15 estimate were budgeted for DPS, offering no further comment. For another legislative perspective, we contacted a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands. Via email, Gary Scharrer asserted that as a committee member, Patrick would have known the wider scope of border spending and could have requested such numbers before his June campaign announcement. Scharrer said via email that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget. We weren’t able to learn what date that estimate was produced, but Scharrer said Patrick would have been aware that such spending was going into the budget. \"He would have been in the loop on border security budget discussions,\" Scharrer said. Noting the Senate gave the budget act its final approval on May 25, Scharrer said, \"The numbers were available\" to Patrick. \"Sen. Patrick could have checked with LBB or DPS for clarification – or verification – before going public. Many members fact-check ahead of time,\" Scharrer said, adding with a note of humor that they do so \"to save themselves from PolitiFact sweeping in after them.\" As to budgeted money to battle criminal gangs, Barton told us DPS’s \"organized crime\" category was not the only state money spent to fight gangs. However, he said, the budget board did not have an estimate of such a 2014-15 total. Spence said he stood by the information he sent us. \"People read those summaries and rely on those summaries as accurate data from the Legislative Budget Board,\" he said. Asked about the budget board staff’s July 15 estimate of $331.2 million border spending in DPS for 2014-15, Spence said, \"I think there’s a disagreement about what is border security spending.\" Citing a couple of items mentioned in the July 15 estimate, Spence said, \"A raise for troopers is not border security spending. Police academies and all those things... If the budget says ‘Border security spending is this,’ then members of the committee and members of the Senate are going to rely on that.\" Barton said all items in the estimate relate directly to border security. For instance, he said, the nearly $75 million in listed pay raises reflects money going to officers involved in border operations. Our ruling Patrick said the 2014-15 state budget written by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry \"cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs.\" Yet his cited figures drew from budget summaries that did not show all border spending. Budgeted border security funding in 2014-15 exceeds the total in the 2012-13 budget by about one third, while budgeted 2014-15 spending on battling gangs has yet to be fully calculated. It’s a PolitiFact principle not to hold people responsible for information that wasn’t available when they made their claims. In this instance, though, our sense is Patrick could at least have pinned down total border security funding before he spoke. The fact that anti-gang spending has still not been totaled leaves Patrick’s claim with a possible element of truth. We rate the full statement as Mostly False.\n",

Claim: In the video, the two men were beaten by the Police personnel for not wearing a helmet Fact: The two men were beaten by the Police for eve-teasing a girl in a college. Hence, the claim is FALSE. When the video in the post is run through the ‘InVid’ plugin, several keyframes were obtained.

The same video can also be seen in the article published regarding the incident by “My Nation”. A news report of “Deccan Herald” which corroborates with the above version can also be seen here.

            "claim [Claim]: One can observe some symptoms to determine whether they were infected with the Omicron variant, the Delta variant, earlier variants of COVID-19, or the flu\n",
            "[Evidences]:Some Facebook (FB) pages have shared a graphic on how to “spot COVID-19” amid heightened reports of infections with Omicron, Delta, and the seasonal flu in the new year. It, however, misinforms. VERA Files Fact Check looked into the sources cited in the graphic. All four of these – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC), Yale Medicine, COVID Study App, and Gavi suggest there is no evident difference in the symptom profile. Further, differentiating the medical conditions cannot be based on symptoms alone. The Department of Health (DOH), on Jan. 4, also affirmed there is no clear distinction in the symptom profiles of an earlier coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from other virus variants and influenza. The DOH emphasized that “it is difficult to tell by symptoms alone what caused your infection,” and the more prudent action is to take RT-PCR or antigen tests to confirm what you have. The post identified the following as “general symptoms” of COVID-19: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. It claimed that Omicron has nine, adding night sweats and excluding loss of taste or smell. Delta only has fourーheadache, a sore throat, runny nose, and feverーand “may cause twice as many infections as COVID-19.” The flu has eight but is “possibly less transmissible than COVID-19.” But the health department pointed out the symptoms are “generally similar” for COVID-19 infection, whether Delta or Omicron variant or even with the regular flu. The erroneous graphic, uploaded on Dec. 23, 2021, can be traced to the official Instagram account of The Healthy, which claims to provide “real, science-backed answers for your most important health questions and problems.” It was reposted by the magazine Readers’ Digest eight days later. From the sources cited by the graphic, here is what each had to say: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In an email to VERA Files Fact Check, the U.S. CDC said: “All previous variants cause similar COVID-19 symptoms. Some variants, such as the Alpha and Delta variants, may cause more severe illness and death.” On Oct. 26, 2021, the CDC published a table that compared COVID-19 and the flu. In the caption, the health agency wrote, “Both respiratory illnesses have some similar, common symptoms. But people sick with COVID-19 often have key symptoms less common for people sick with flu.” In an article, reviewed on Nov. 23, 2021, the CDC noted that since some symptoms of flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory illnesses are “similar,” the difference between them cannot be based on symptoms alone. For example, COVID-19 can cause more serious illnesses in some people, can take longer before people show symptoms, and people can be contagious for longer. It stressed the need for testing “to tell what the illness is and to confirm a diagnosis.” “People can be infected with both flu and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time and have symptoms of both influenza and COVID-19,” the agency added. In a Dec. 20 article, it said that “more data are needed to know if Omicron infections cause more severe illness or death than infection with other variants.” COVID Study App The London-based health science company ZOE, which hosts a COVID Study mobile phone app launched in March 2020, said there was “no clear difference in the symptom profile of Delta and Omicron.” The team reported the finding in a Dec. 21, 2021 blog post titled “What are the symptoms of Omicron?” It looked at the “most recent” data from London—which it described as having the highest number of cases with Omicron in the United Kingdom—and compared it with data collected from early October 2021, when the Delta variant was more dominant. From its study during the covered period, the company listed the top five symptoms reported as runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and sore throat. In an email to VERA Files Fact Check on Jan. 5, the team highlighted that the contributors to the app were “mostly fully vaccinated, either with two or three doses, so these symptoms related to vaccinated individuals.” It currently has no data on the symptoms of unvaccinated people. Another false graphic that cited the study likewise made rounds on social media this week. (Read VERA FILES FACT CHECK: COVID task force ex-adviser Tony Leachon shares false guide on ‘first 8 Omicron symptoms’) Yale Medicine Dr. Lauren Ferrante, Yale Medicine pulmonologist, did say in a Jan. 4 article that early reports from South Africa indicate that most cases infected with Omicron “have been mild and that symptoms for this variant may be different.” “The reports show that patients in South Africa—many of whom were young—have had severe fatigue, but no loss of taste or smell,” she said. But the Yale researchers also wrote that the severity of the Omicron variant is “not yet clear” compared to Delta. They have raised concerns over its several mutations in the spike protein, which attaches to human cells that could increase the probability of infection. “It is also possible that symptoms differ depending on a person’s vaccination status, and/or whether they have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection.” GAVI GAVI, a public-private global health partnership for vaccine access, referred to similar reports from the ZOE COVID Study App in a Dec. 17 article. But it did say, “Reassuring as such reports may sound, these were based on very little data, as in most cases it takes several weeks after infection for severe symptoms to develop.” Asked to comment on the graphic, GAVI wrote in an email to VERA Files Fact Check: “Looks like this graphic was prepared as a combination of a whole bunch of sources, I don’t know what the authors sourced exactly from the Gavi website, unfortunately.” They linked VERA Files Fact Check to two relevant pieces recently published on their website on Sept. 29, 2021, titled “Seven COVID-19 symptoms you shouldn’t ignore” and on Oct. 19, 2021, titled “Is it a cold or COVID-19? An expert explains”. In a Dec. 17, 2021 explainer, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID-19 Technical Lead of the World Health Organization (WHO), said they have “not seen a change” in the symptoms that people present with Omicron compared to Delta, so people “will not be able to tell the difference.” “The best thing for you to do is to keep yourself safe, get vaccinated when you can, and make sure you take steps to reduce your exposure to this virus,” reminded Kerkhove, who is an infectious disease epidemiologist. Based on social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, at least two local officials shared the post on their FB pages: Kagawad Peter Mendoza from Quezon City with over 1,100 followers and Councilor Czylene T. Marqueses from Tanuan, Batangas with 13,000 followers. The page of Kagawad Peter Mendoza has since taken down the post as of publication. Posts on the symptoms of infection with Omicron and Delta variants have circulated just as the Philippines logged a post-holiday surge resulting in 181,016 active infections as of Jan. 11. While the country has yet to declare Omicron as the dominant strain, health officials urged the public to continue to observe physical distancing, masking, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.

            "claim [Claim]: \"Seven Milwaukee wards report more 2020 presidential votes than registered voters.”\n",
            "[Evidences]:Many political eyes are on Wisconsin after Democratic nominee Joe Biden narrowly won the state, which was the first one to flip parties in a contentious presidential race that’s still too close to call. The increased attention has led to a surge in misinformation about the state’s election process. One popular — and very false — claim is that the battleground state had more ballots cast than registered voters. An online article shared widely on social media narrowed that claim to Milwaukee, the state’s largest city and a Democratic stronghold. \"Seven Milwaukee wards report more 2020 presidential votes than registered voters,\" stated a Nov. 4, 2020 article from Milwaukee City Wire. City Wire later updated the article, but not before an array of other purported news sources echoed the same supposed finding. Those posts remained online after City Wire updated its post the afternoon of Nov. 5. The claim also got some increased attention after a tweet from Sean Hannity. This article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Bottom line: It’s wrong. Very wrong. The source Before we get into the claim itself, here’s a refresher on City Wire. The website is one of several purported local news sites run by Metric Media Publications. In Wisconsin, the company operates 24 web pages including \"Green Bay Reporter\" and \"Fon du Lac News,\" which notably misspells the city name of Fond du Lac. The Columbia Journalism Review reported the network relies heavily on algorithmically-generated stories and can be traced to conservative businessman Brian Timpone. His former company, Journatic, drew outrage in 2012 for plagiarism, fake bylines and fake quotes in what was dubbed \"pink slime journalism.\" Back in August, we looked at an \"analysis\" from the website about Biden’s school choice policy and determined it was False. Now, onto the latest claim. The crux of the headline centered around seven wards on Milwaukee’s southwest side. The unnamed writers of the article claimed to use data showing the number of ballots cast for the presidential race in these wards exceeded the number of registered voters. There are a few problems here. The first: The numbers were completely incorrect. Here are the unofficial results in those wards as reported by the Milwaukee County clerk’s office (election results aren’t final until officials complete canvassing): 234: 688 registered voters; 588 total ballots cast; 458 votes for Biden; 114 votes for President Donald Trump. 269: 978 registered voters; 861 total ballots cast; 451 votes for Biden; 388 votes for Trump. 272: 1,190 registered voters; 1,096 total ballots cast; 512 votes for Biden; 567 votes for Trump. 273: 671 registered voters; 612 total ballots cast; 313 votes for Biden; 290 votes for Trump. 274: 702 registered voters; 611 total ballots cast; 296 votes for Biden; 297 votes for Trump. 277: 1,520 registered voters; 1,321 total ballots cast; 688 votes for Biden; 602 votes for Trump. 312: 1,029 registered voters; 951 total ballots cast; 553 votes for Biden; 389 votes for Trump. Whether you look at total ballots cast in each ward or just those cast for Biden and Trump, the amount does not exceed the total number of registered voters. (Quick note: Votes for Biden and Trump don’t add up to total ballots cast because there were other candidates for president, and some people may not have voted in that race.) Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel it wasn’t clear where the numbers in the article came from. She said the reporting software from the city and county reflect different numbers than what City Wire published. For instance, the article said Ward 274 cast 1,290 votes for Biden and Trump when the number was actually only 593. City Wire also cited the Wisconsin Secretary of State’s office as the source of the data. But, unlike in some other states, that office in Wisconsin is not involved in the state’s elections and therefore doesn’t collect election data. \"My office coworkers who first saw that and called it to my attention and I have no idea what they’re talking about because we have no such records,\" said Secretary of State Doug La Follette, whose small office focuses on authenticating official documents with the state seal. City Wire published an updated article with an editor’s note on Nov. 5, 2020 that said Milwaukee County updated voter registration data and voting tallies for nine wards after the original version was published shortly after 3 p.m. on Nov. 4. But that's untrue. An archived version of the county election results showed the wards in question had accurate results posted as of 9:48 a.m. Wednesday, hours before the first version of this story published. This is also confirmed by the timestamp on the county website, which notes it was last updated at 3:56a.m. Nov. 4. On a broader scale, the Wisconsin Elections Commission has emphasized that it’s simply not possible for there to be more ballots than registered voters. Wisconsin allows people to register at the polls on Election Day. \"There are never more ballots than registered voters,\" the commission tweeted on Nov. 4, 2020. A widely-shared online article said \"seven Milwaukee wards report more 2020 presidential votes than registered voters.\" The numbers cited by Milwaukee City Wire do not match data from the Milwaukee County clerk’s office, which show the number of registered voters exceeded ballots cast. Moreover, it’s simply not possible for there to be more ballots than voters. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n",

            "[Evidences]:It sure sounds outrageous. On his upcoming presidential trip to India, President Barack Obama is bringing an entourage of 3,000, staying in swanky hotels, guarded by an armada of Navy ships -- costing American taxpayers the staggering sum of $200 million a day.To say this figure -- $200 million a day -- has made the rounds in the blogosphere would be a hugeunderstatement. It has been repeated by nearly every conservative pundit in the land: Hannity, Limbaugh, Beck, Drudge. Always with a healthy dose of indignation.It also got picked up by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Nov. 3, 2010, it was just the latest example of government excess and spending from the Obama administration.\"The president of the United States will be taking a trip over to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day,\" Bachmann said. \"He's taking 2,000 people with him. He will be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are five-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending. It's a very small example, Anderson.\"And I think this is an example of the massive overspending that we have seen, not only just in the last two years, really in the last four. That's what we saw at the ballot box last evening.\"Again, $200 million a day sounds outrageous. But is it true?The White House says, emphatically, that it's not.\"Due to security concerns, we are unable to outline details associated with security procedures and costs, but it’s safe to say these numbers are wildly inflated,\" said White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield.Cooper asked Bachmann how she came up with the number.\"These are the numbers that have been coming out in the press,\" Bachmann said.Actually it's a figure that came from just one source, a news agency in India, relying on an anonymous source. It was then repeated thousands more times in the blogosphere and over conservative airwaves.The claim that the U.S. would be spending \"a whopping $200 million per day\" on Obama's visit to Mumbai, India, originated in a report from the news agency Press Trust of India. It was an estimate attributed anonymously to \"a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit.\" Maharashtra is a state located in western India.Here's what the story said:\"The huge amount of around $200 million would be spent on security, stay and other aspects of the Presidential visit,\" a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit said.About 3,000 people including Secret Service agents, U.S. government officials and journalists would accompany the President. Several officials from the White House and U.S. security agencies are already here for the past one week with helicopters, a ship and high-end security instruments.Said Bedingfield: \"The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality.\"Now it's true that overseas travel by presidents can be expensive, said Kelley Gannon, who worked on the press advance team for George H. W. Bush and was director of press advance for George W. Bush. \"You have to re-create a mini White House.\"But pegging an exact cost has long been an elusive task for news reporters.In an Oct. 7, 2009, story for McClatchy Newspapers, reporter Steven Thomma took a stab:The costs of the trips -- borne by taxpayers -- are difficult to measure, but they're expensive. When (the president) uses the familiar blue-and-white reconfigured 747 as Air Force One, it costs $100,219 an hour to operate, according to the Air Force. And that's just HIS plane.There also are cargo planes, used to fly in armored limousines, helicopters, staff and other equipment, as well as the Secret Service. A single Air Force C-17 cargo jet, for example, costs $6,960 an hour, according to the Congressional Research Service.A total of 77 other aircraft were used on one multi-country trip to Asia by former President Bill Clinton in 2000, according to the Air Force Times, including 14 C-17 Globemasters, 12 C-5 Galaxys, three C-141 Starlifters and two C-130 Hercules. ABC News at the time estimated the cost of that entire trip at $50 million.An Air Force Times story on March 27, 2000, said Clinton's trip to India and Pakistan \"may be the most expensive such mission ever carried out by the Air Force.\" The reporters said the operation required hundreds of aircraft missions. They tagged the cost of the 5-day trip at $50 million as well. That comes to $10 million per day.Previous trips by the Clinton administration were less expensive, according to a September 1999 U.S. Government Accountability Office analysis of the costs for Clinton's 1998 trips to Africa, Chile and China.\"Presidential travel to foreign destinations requires planning, coordination, and logistical and personnel support,\" the report stated. \"The estimated incremental costs of President Clinton’s trips to Africa, Chile, and China were at least $42.8 million, $10.5 million, and $18.8 million, respectively. The largest of these costs consisted of operating expenses of the president’s aircraft and other military passenger and cargo aircraft; travel expenses, including lodging for the travelers; and telecommunications, vehicle, and other equipment rentals and procurement in the countries visited.\"We couldn't find any significant evidence that Obama's 3-day trip to India was going to be unusual in scope.According to Press Trust of India and the Times of India, two US Air Force Jumbos and four helicopters landed ahead of the president's visit; and Obama will be protected by a fleet of 34 warships, including an aircraft carrier.In addition, the Times story states:Obama is expected to fly by a helicopter -- Marine One -- from the city airport to the Indian Navy's helibase INS Shikra at Colaba in south Mumbai.From there, he will drive down in a Lincoln Continental -- the Presidential limousine -- to the nearby the Taj Hotel.Two jets, armed with advanced communication and security systems, and a fleet of over 40 cars will be part of Obama's convoy.Around 800 rooms have been booked for the President and his entourage in Taj Hotel and Hyatt.The President will have a security ring of American elite Secret Service, which are tasked to guard the President, along with National Security Guards (NSG) and personnel from central paramilitary forces and local police in Mumbai and Delhi.Similar arrangements will be in place in Delhi, with the Air Force One to be kept in all readiness throughout Obama's stay here from Sunday afternoon to Tuesday morning. That probably sounds like a lot, but it's pretty standard fare for presidential travel, several people familiar with such travel told us.James Gerstenzang, a former reporter who covered numerous foreign trips by presidents for the Los Angeles Times, laughed at the $200 million a day figure, which he guessed was probably \"inflated by a factor of 10.\" And the claim about the entourage of 3,000 also seems grossly inflated, he said. He noted that any members of the press traveling with the president pay their own way, so that's not a cost borne by taxpayers.\"It really bothers me when numbers like that get thrown around by both sides for political reasons, without it being backed up,\" Gerstenzang said.Veteran reporter David Jackson, who has traveled on a number of foreign trips by presidents, wrote for the USA Today, \"No, President Obama's trip is not going to cost $200 million a day.\"\"That figure -- first thrown out by a single Indian media outlet and now viral on conservative talk radio -- is wildly, wildly off the mark.\"And basing the claim on an estimate from an anonymous state government official in India is dubious at best.\"I think you have to ask, 'How would they know how much any of this costs?'\" said Gannon, the advance press director under George W. Bush \"We don't share that with officials from foreign governments. I'd question where they got that number from. That does sound very inflated.\"As fact-checkers, we wish we had hard numbers from public documents to settle the issue of the cost of Obama's trip to India. But they don't exist. White House officials say details about foreign travel -- including the cost -- are not released for security reasons. So we don't know the cost to taxpayers of Obama's trip.But we think Bachmann and others have a responsibility to back up statistics they cite. And in this case, the backing appears to be one news story, relying on an anonymous state government official in India. People familiar with presidential travel say that estimate is way off, and they question how a government official in India would know anyway. And a report by the independent GAO backs that up: A trip to India by Clinton, regarded at the time as perhaps the most expensive in history, was estimated to cost $50 million, or $10 million per day. That alone should cause someone to question the $200 million a day figure. In short, we don't see any evidence to back up this statistic. And we rate Bachmann's claim False.\n",

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In August 2021, right-wing Tennessee pastor Greg Locke used one of his regular sermons to rail against aspects of the Biden administration’s COVID-19 mitigation policies, and attacked Republican Gov. Bill Lee, falsely claiming Lee had authorized the construction of “quarantine camps” for residents who refused to be vaccinated against the virus. Locke’s remarks, which were first reported by Right Wing Watch, came in the context of his Aug. 8 sermon at the Global Vision Bible Church in Juliet, Tennessee. There, he railed against virus lockdowns, vaccine and mask mandates, and called Lee “a coward,” “a noodle,” and a “waffler.” The sermon can be watched in full here. The following is an edited transcript of the relevant section, which begins around the 1:39:00 mark, and a clip from the sermon can be watched below. Did you see this nonsense our governor signed?…Did you see the executive order he just signed for COVID-19?…He has authorized the power of the National Guard to get involved in issues of COVID-19… You know what bothers me more about the National Guard getting involved? Why don’t you look at Section 8 of what he signed? They have authorized…the Tennessee Department of FEMA to build what they call — in its own authorized pages of a signature! — “quarantine camps.” I ain’t talking about East Germany! I’m talking about Tennessee! “Quarantine camps.” For the uninformed people that are still in refusal to be vaccinated. Look, if that don’t bother you, you might as well show up at another church next week. While it’s not entirely clear what “its own authorized pages of a signature” means, it appears Locke was referring to Executive Order 83, signed by Lee on Aug. 6, which was entitled “An Order to Facilitate the Continued Response to COVID-19.” Examination of the text of the order reveals that Locke either fundamentally misunderstood, or grossly misrepresented, its contents, and we are issuing a rating of “False.” Section 8 of that order grants the governor discretion to deploy the National Guard and State Guard in certain supplementary healthcare roles if hospital and care facility capacity and human resources are stretched, including ambulance driving and COVID-19 testing. Section 18 is subtitled “Temporary quarantine and isolation facilities may be constructed,” and states: The provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 68-11-202(c)(1)-(8), are hereby suspended to allow for the construction of temporary structures, the plans for which would otherwise be subject to review for new construction, additions, or substantial alterations, as directed by the Commissioner of Health and the Director of TEMA in response to COVID-19; provided, that there shall be inspections of such structures to ensure safety, as necessary. Section 68-11-202(c) of the Tennessee Code sets out various planning and building regulations that relate to any facility that requires licensing by the state Department of Health (i.e. healthcare facilities), including the requirement to submit detailed construction and use plans to the department, and obtain permission to begin construction. In suspending those regulations, Lee’s order would speed up the process of building temporary quarantine and isolation facilities, should they be required, for individuals who are obliged to quarantine or self-isolate because they have tested positive for COVID-19, or are a close contact of someone in that position. Although many private businesses require proof of vaccination in order to access goods and services, and some state and local governments are considering proposals to introduce “vaccine passports,” quarantine and self-isolation regulations are in place for those who have tested positive for COVID-19, and their close contacts — not individuals who are unvaccinated. The executive order does not even affirmatively order the actual construction of such facilities, but rather removes one set of regulatory obstacles for such construction. The putative facilities in question would be for use by COVID-positive individuals and their contacts, and not unvaccinated Tennesseans. Contrary to Locke’s energetic exclamations, the text of the executive order never once refers to “quarantine camps,” not least because that’s not what they would be.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “Don’t forget, President Trump requested increased National Guard support in the days leading up to January 6. The request was rejected — by Pelosi, by congressional leaders, including requests, by the way, from the Capitol Police chief.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight — Sean Hannity of Fox News, speaking to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Dec. 13 “What we also know is that President Trump wanted to make sure that the people that came, that there was a safe environment for that kind of assembly. And I’ve said that publicly before — the 10,000 National Guard troops that he wanted to make sure that everything was safe and secure. … Obviously having those National Guards available, actually the reason they were able to respond when they did, was because President Trump had actually put them on alert.” — Meadows, to Hannity Advertisement It’s always dismaying when false claims that were previously debunked turn up as accepted facts months later. Yet, increasingly, Fox News hosts and their guests appear to live in a world untethered by the truth. As we have documented before, President Donald Trump never requested 10,000 National Guard troops to secure the Capitol that day. He threw out a number, in casual conversation, that is now regarded by his supporters as a lifeline to excuse his inaction when a mob inspired by his rhetoric invaded the Capitol. Let’s take a fresher course. The Facts Just one month after the attack, Meadows appeared on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” and made this claim: “As many as 10,000 National Guard troops were told to be on the ready by the secretary of defense. That was a direct order from President Trump.” Advertisement Later that month, Trump appeared to confirm Meadows’s account in an interview with Fox News. “I definitely gave the number of 10,000 National Guardsmen and [said] I think you should have 10,000 of the National Guard ready,” Trump said. “They took that number. From what I understand, they gave it to the people at the Capitol, which is controlled by [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi. And I heard they rejected it because they didn’t think it would look good.” But it turns out a Vanity Fair reporter was embedded with acting defense secretary Christopher Miller and his top aides during the period leading up to the insurrection. That real-time access provided a different version than the account offered by Trump and his former chief of staff. During a meeting on Iran with Miller on the evening of Jan. 5, Trump suddenly shifted direction, Vanity Fair reported. Advertisement The president, Miller recalled, asked how many troops the Pentagon planned to turn out the following day. “We’re like, ‘We’re going to provide any National Guard support that the District requests,’” Miller responded. “And [Trump] goes, ‘You’re going to need 10,000 people.’ No, I’m not talking bullsh--. He said that. And we’re like, ‘Maybe. But you know, someone’s going to have to ask for it.’” The reporter, Adam Ciralsky, asked Miller why Trump threw out such a big number: “The president’s sometimes hyperbolic, as you’ve noticed. There were gonna be a million people in the street, I think was his expectation.” (It was just thousands of people.) In other words, 10,000 troops was a guesstimate based on Trump’s inflated belief in his ability to draw a crowd. The statement did not come as part of a meeting to discuss how to handle the event. Instead, it appears to have been an offhand remark. That’s not the same thing as a “request.” (Trump certainly knew how to order the deployment of National Guard troops in June 2020.) In fact, the Defense Department never acted on Trump’s remarks, according to our reporting, as department officials did not regard the offhand comment to be a “direct order,” as Meadows claimed. Advertisement Miller and other senior Pentagon officials did not relay the 10,000 figure to anyone outside the Defense Department, according to a former U.S. official who was familiar with the matter. “They didn’t act on it, because based on discussions with federal and local law enforcement leadership, they didn’t think a force of that size would be necessary,” the former official told The Fact Checker. Indeed, the official Defense Department planning and execution memo on the Jan. 6 events also makes no mention of any such discussion. Instead, it notes the possible activation of 340 National Guard troops to assist the D.C. government with traffic control — a move that came about after a Dec. 31 request by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said officials checked the records after Trump’s remarks about ordering 10,000 National Guard troops. “We have no record of such an order being given,” Kirby told The Fact Checker. Advertisement It’s worth noting that the Defense Department inspector general, in a report that said top Army leaders acted appropriately on Jan. 6, appears to place the conversation between Miller and Trump on a different date — Jan. 3. Mr. Miller and GEN Milley met with the President at the White House at 5:30 p.m. The primary topic they discussed was unrelated to the scheduled rally. GEN Milley told us that at the end of the meeting, the President told Mr. Miller that there would be a large number of protesters on January 6, 2021, and Mr. Miller should ensure sufficient National Guard or Soldiers would be there to make sure it was a safe event. Gen Milley told us that Mr. Miller responded, “We’ve got a plan and we’ve got it covered.” But no direct order is mentioned. On Jan. 5, the IG report says, Trump and Miller had a phone call and “the President’s guidance was to do what was required to protect the American people.” Again, Trump’s instructions appear vague. In his recently published memoir, Meadows makes the unsupported claim that there were “several offers from the White House and DoD to send 10,000 National Guard into our nation’s capitol” before the rally but that Bowser “refused to accept their help.” As we noted, the Defense Department did not take Trump’s offhand remark seriously and officials said the figure was not mentioned outside the building. Meadows adds, “The response time, which has been largely criticized, was only possible because the National Guard had been put on alert at the president’s direction.” Advertisement Almost a year later, there continues to be confusion about why it took so long to deploy the National Guard after the Capitol was breached. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy withheld authority from William J. Walker, at the time the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, to activate the quick reaction force, a requirement that Walker in congressional testimony said was “unusual.” Other officials have testified that key Army officials were concerned about the “optics” of troops at the Capitol. The Defense Department IG report quotes senior Army leaders as saying that they prepared to mobilize the Guard and that it took two calls from McCarthy to Walker to implement a plan. But Walker — now the House sergeant-at-arms — and his former counsel, Col. Earl Matthews, have fiercely disputed that account, saying in a memo in response that it is “replete with factual inaccuracies, discrepancies and faulty analysis.” They said that McCarthy did not make such calls to Walker and that Army officials are trying to cover up their mistakes. Advertisement Notably, neither the IG report nor the Walker response memo make any reference to Trump having a role in the response. Vanity Fair quotes a senior defense official as saying Defense Department officials could not reach Trump during the insurrection: “They couldn’t get through. They tried to call him.” As the congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 has disclosed, Meadows was besieged with emails from lawmakers and Fox News personalities urging Trump to take action to halt the riot — emails that Meadows does not mention in his book. Interestingly, a report by the congressional committee examining Jan. 6 events says that Meadows “sent an email to an individual about the events on January 6 and said that the National Guard would be present to ‘'protect pro Trump people’ and that many more would be available on standby.” The committee, in citing Meadows for contempt for refusing to cooperate, is seeking more information about this issue. The Pinocchio Test In the Hannity-Meadows version of history, Trump was a hero, ordering a massive force of National Guard troops to protect the Capitol — only to have his order of 10,000 troops rejected by liberal foes. There is no evidence to support such claims. No investigation has turned up any such order. Advertisement Rather, Trump made an offhand remark in a meeting unrelated to the events of Jan. 6, based on an inflated expectation of the crowd that would gather that day. Moreover, when the Capitol was breached, Trump was AWOL, unengaged in the effort to end the riot and restore order.

            "[Evidences]:Nigerians again hit the polling boothson 9 March 2019, this time to vote in governors and state assemblies.To help inform voters,The City that Works Alliance, a numberof professional groups, has in recent weeks organised debates for those who would govern Lagos, the country’s commercial nerve centre.(Disclosure: As part of a partnership with the organisers, Africa Check was asked to verify claims made in the debates.)The debates took place in February 2019, one for deputy governor candidates and the other for governor candidates.Seven parties took part, providing 10 candidates. Only three - theLabour Party, theNational Conscience Partyand theYoung Progressives Partywere in both debates.Other parties seeking to run the city areAdvanced Nigeria Democratic Party,Mega Party of Nigeria,Africa Action Congressand theAll Progressives Congress.But did they all get their facts straight? We looked at several claims.The economyClaim “Lagos is the economic hub of Nigeria. Its economy is among the top two or three in Africa.” Verdict unprovenWho: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience PartyGross domestic productis a measure of the size of a country’s economy. Itcan also be usedfor smaller regions such as cities and states.Awe told Africa Check he was comparing Lagos’s economy with that of other African cities. He added that for GDP, Lagos was only comparable to Johannesburg and Cairo.The most recent data on Lagos’s GDP is froma surveydone from December 2011 to April 2012. It found that the state’s GDP was US$80 billion in 2010, whichit saidmade it the fourth biggest city economy in sub-Saharan Africa after Cairo, Johannesburg and Cape Town.But in 2014 Nigeria reviewed its economyto better countsectors such as telecoms and the movie industry. This saw national GDP nearly double, from $270 billion to $510 billion.READ:What do Nigeria’s new GDP numbers really mean?But the survey took its African cities data from Wikipedia,which notesthat comparisons are difficult as data is collected in different ways. Without more reliable and newer data we can’t prove or disprove this claim.(Note: We have contacted the state for when it will have newer GDP data).Claim “Lagos contributes significantly to Nigeria’s GDP.” Verdict correctWho: Adesina Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Young Progressives PartyThestatistics bureau’s latest data shows that Nigeria’s nominal GDP wasN127.76 trillionin 2018. But it doesn’t break this down by states.GDP data for Lagos, one of 36 states, is only available for 2010, when its output ofN12.09 trillionmade up 35.6% of the national total.Claim “Multiple taxation is real in Lagos but, statistically, less than 10% of the population of Lagos pay tax.” Verdict incorrectWho: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience PartyThe most recent publicly available official figures on taxpayers in Lagos state is from 2016.Thetax reportfrom theLagos Internal Revenue Serviceput the state’s total number of taxpayers at4.9 million.In 2016 the population of Lagos was estimatedat 12.6 millionby theNational Bureau of Statistics. But population numbers in Nigeria are highly contested - a state governoris on recordsaying the population is more than 24 million. The statealso givesits population as 24.6 million in 2015.For taxpayers to be only 10% of the population, Lagos would need about 50 million people. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect.Claim “About 60% of taxes in Lagos is paid by civil servants.” Verdict unprovenWho: Prof Ifagbemi Awamaridi, governor candidate, Labour PartyState authorities have estimated Lagos’s taxpayers at4.9 millionin 2016 and5.3 millionin 2017.The statededucts taxfrom civil servants’ salaries at source, but we couldn’t find verified data on the share of taxes paid by public workers.Taiwo Oyedele,head of tax and corporate advisory services atPwC Nigeria, said civil servants could pay up to 60% of Lagos taxes. “The figure is up to that. However, I can’t lay my hands on data to back it up,” he told Africa Check.Claim “The APC government has taken the state’s monthly internally generated revenue from N600 million in 1999 to N33 billion.” Verdict correctWho: Obafemi Hamzat, deputy governor candidate, All Progressives CongressIn 1999, under former governor Bola Tinubu, Lagos generated monthly revenue of N600 million,according tothe World Bank. In May 2018 the state’s top financial officer said Lagos was generating aboutN34 billion a monthin own revenue.Claim “People say the internally generated revenue is high, but the budget of Lagos state is less than $3 billion.” Verdict mostly-correctWho: Obafemi HamzatHamzat, who has headed the state’s infrastructure and science dockets, said Lagos’s budget was too low for its needs.Does Nigeria’s commercial capital operate on less than $3 billion? The 2019 budget is yet to be law, but the 2018 budget wasN1.046 trillion, or $3.42 billion at theofficial rateof N306 to a dollar.However, the state’s budget was $2.2 billionin 2016; $2.7 billionin 2017and $2.8 billionproposed for 2019– all less than $3 billion. On the balance of this trend we find this claim mostly correct.Claim “[Lagos’s budget] is what the city of New York uses to fight fire.” Verdict incorrectWho: Obafemi HamzatHamzat said the state’s budget was equivalent to that of New York city’s fire department.New York’s 2018 budget was$84.9 billion, with$2.04 billiongoing to thefire department. Lagos’s 2018 budget was$3.42 billion, so the candidate was off the mark by about $1.38 billion.Claim “The budget of the New York police department is twice that of Lagos State.” Verdict exaggeratedWho: Obafemi HamzatTheNew York Police Department’sapproved budgetfor 2018 was $5.57 billion. Lagos’s 2018 budget wasN1.046 trillion, or $3.42 billion at theofficial rateof N306 to a dollar.This is not half the budget of the NYPD. Hamzat would have been more on the mark in 2017, when Lagos’s budget wasN812.99 billion($2.7 billion), half what New York police spent -$5.58 billion.Claim “About 56% of VAT collection in this country comes from Lagos.” Verdict unprovenWho: Obafemi HamzatIn 2018 national collection of value added tax wasN1.103 trillion, fromN972.3 billionin 2017.Recent comparable full data for Lagos is however incomplete: From January to June 2018 it collectedN8.03 billion, andN6.38 billionfor the first six months of 2017.But while Lagos accounts for “most consumption” VAT receipts are “confidential”,Federal Inland Revenue Servicespokesperson Wahab Gbadamosi told Africa Check.“I may not be able to give you figures that say either 50 or 90% of VAT, those documents are confidential, I don’t have the figure that more than 56% of VAT comes from Lagos.” In the absence of this information we rate this claim unproven.Claim “…and then we (Lagos) don’t get it back.” Verdict misleadingWho: Obafemi HamzatAgain using the example of New York, Hamzat said the US city was able to do more for its residents as it kept a large chunk of the sales tax it collected.Thefederation accountallocation reportreleased by theNational Bureau of Statisticsin December 2018 shows how the central government shared the month’s revenue.Lagos gotN8.23 billion,or59.4%, of the N13.85 billion it generated in VAT that month.PopulationClaim “The population of Lagos is unknown.” Verdict correctWho: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience PartyLagos’s population has been a source ofcontroversysince the disputed 2006 national census – Nigeria’s most recent.That count put the population of Lagos at 9 million. The state governmentrejected this, claiming the correct number was 17.5 million. On its website the state gives the population as 24.6 million in 2015.However, theNational Bureau of Statisticsestimated Lagos’s population at12.6 millionin 2016.HealthClaim “Presently, we don’t have primary healthcare centres in Lagos.” Verdict incorrectWho: Oluwasegun Musa, governor candidate, Advanced Nigeria Democratic partyMusa likened the primary healthcare centres in Lagos to immunisation centres.There are five types of health institution in Nigeria, according to theNational Primary Health Care Development Agency. The agency lists theminimum requirementsof each.Those classified as primary health centres - which must cover at least 10 voting wards, serving 10,000 to 20,000 people in a local government - 288meet the requirementsin Lagos.They offer more than routine immunisation.EducationClaim “What Lagos is using to service debt is higher than what it devotes to education.” Verdict exaggeratedIn 2017 Lagos spentN30.9 billionservicing its total debt ofN874.38 billion. The budget for education that year wasN92.44 billion.In 2016 the state spentN13.2 billionon its debt ofN603.25 billionand allocatedN113.379 billionto education.Claim “The recommended percentage of the budget that should go to education according to the United Nations is 26%.” Verdict unprovenWho: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience PartyAwe said successive governments had not adequately funded education. Lagos allocated less than the share the UN recommended for education, which he said was 26% of the state’s annual budget.The claim that countries should attribute 26% of their budget to education is popular in Nigeria and often attributed to theUN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.But we could find no evidence of it. The UN agency does have a “recommended”15% to 20%of the annual budget, but this is for countries, not states.Claim “Local governments by law are supposed to take care of primary schools across the country.” Verdict correctWho: Obafemi Hamzat, deputy governor candidate, All Progressives CongressLagos state government taking on the responsibilities of local governments was also discussed.Hamzat said local governments should ideally run primary education, but state governments took over when local governments failed to pay teachers’ salaries.Nigeria’sconstitutionclearlystates thatlocal governments are responsible for “the provision and maintenance of primary, adult and vocational education”.Claim “ All public infrastructure in the state from that time complied with the [Lagos State Special Peoples] act.” Verdict incorrectWho: Obafemi HamzatTheLagos State Special Peoples Billwaspassed by the statein August 2010, becoming law inJune 2011.It requires public institutions to be accessible to people living with disabilities.But there are gaps in the implementation of the law, David Anyaele, executive director ofCentre for Citizen with Disabilities, told Africa Check.A 2018 studyby the organisation found enforcement “has been very weak” and a number of state facilities were “largely inaccessible”, Anyaele said.Claim “We are the only sub-sovereign in the world that is funding a rail longer than 7 kilometres from its balance sheet; it never happens anywhere in the world.” Verdict incorrectWho: Obafemi HamzatWe find this claim inaccurate. Lagosis fundingsuch a project from its resources, but external funds have also been used.TheLagos Urban Rail Networkof urban rail lines is expected to cover seven high-demand corridors of the state, at an estimated cost of $135 million.But commercial loans, concessions and bonds have been added to the state’s funding, according to two former state governors. They include aN160 billion loanfrom the World Bank.Thecity of Beijingand the northern Indian city ofUttar Pradeshhave also used this financing model.Claim “ Amsterdam is a city below sea level, like Lagos, but it does not suffer flooding like Lagos.” Verdict incorrectWho: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience PartyWhile parts of Lagoscould beaffected by a rise in sea level, no part of the city is below sea level.Nigeria is not on a list of33 countries in the worldwith land below sea level.The Netherlandsis listed. Atopographic mapshowsnearly halfthe country lies below sea level, including parts of Amsterdam. The country issaid tohave one of the world’s best flood control systems butstill experiences occasional flooding.ServicesClaim “Clearing the rubbish [waste] you see on the road is the responsibility of the local governments.” Verdict correctWho: Olayemi Oladapo, deputy governor candidate, African Action CongressNigeria has 774 local governmentsspread acrossthe 36 states and Federal Capital Territory. Lagos has 20 local governments.Nigeria’s constitutionspells out the functionsof a local government.These include \"the provision and maintenance of public conveniences, sewage and refuse disposal\".GovernanceClaim “The freedom of information act has not been domesticated in Lagos. ” Verdict misleadingWho: Adesina Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Young Progressives PartyLagos state was not open about its operations, many debaters said. Nigeria’s freedom of information actwas signed into lawin 2011.Lagosoften knocks backrequests for information under this law. But in 2017a court ruledthat the law does apply to the state, where it does notrequire “domestication” to take effect. The rulinghas been upheldby higher courts, but information from the stateis still hardto come by. The state government’s booksremainlargely closed to the public.We rate this claim misleading as the existing court ruling ends the argument on domestication of the law.Gender equalityClaim “YPP is the only party in Lagos with a woman as its governorship candidate.” Verdict incorrectWho: Adesina Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Young Progressives PartyApart from the YPP, six other partieshave womenas their candidates for Lagos governor.These are theAfrica Peoples Alliance,Allied Peoples Movement,Progressive Peoples Alliance,Providence People’s CongressandPeople’s Trust.SportsClaim “Lagos state does not have a football team.” Verdict correctWho: Alawuye Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Labour PartyWhile other states own football clubs, “it’s surprising and very bad” that Lagos doesn’t, Ibrahim said.The state doesn’t own a football club in any known league, according to theLagos State Sports Commission.It does allow private clubs to use its facilities, Abimbola Awoyele, a sports journalist, told Africa Check.

            "[Evidences]:Republican Duf Sundheim started on the attack at Tuesday’s debate in San Diego among five candidates vying to be California’s next U.S. senator. But the GOP hopeful missed hard on a fact about the state’s violent crime rate. He used his opening remarks to criticize the race’s frontrunner, Democratic California Attorney General Kamala Harris. \"The PPIC (Public Policy Institute of California) recently reported that Kamala is failing to keep us safe,\" Sundheim said May 10, 2016. \"There is a 34 percent increase in violent crime in the state of California. … And that’s just within the last year.\" The PPIC, a nonpartisan think tank, reported no such thing. What the PPIC said The PPIC report cited by Sundheim doesn’t include final statewide violent crime data for 2015. It has preliminary statistics for January to June 2015 for 66 California cities covering about half of the state’s population. Brandon Martin, the co-author of the report and a research associate at the policy institute, told PolitiFact California that statewide crime statistics for 2015 won’t be available until this summer. Moreoever, Sundheim misstated the preliminary data that the PPIC did have. The authors of the report said 34 of the 66 California cities saw a double-digit percentage increase in violent crimes. They never claimed that the state, or even the sample of cities, saw a 34 percent increase in violent crime. \"I have not seen any data showing a 34 percent increase in crime in California in 2015. He made a mistake,\" Magnus Lofstrum, the study’s author and a senior fellow at PPIC, told PolitiFact California. The most recent full-year crime stats, from 2014, put the state’s violent crime rate at a 47-year low, according to the PPIC. A spokeswoman for Sundheim’s campaign said, \"Looking at the study, the wording is vague and our researchers believed that the '34'was in reference to the percent rise in violent crime.\" Our ruling Sundheim said California’s violent crime rate increased 34 percent over the past year, citing a recent report. Sundheim misread the report in question, its authors said. We rate his claim False. FALSE–The statement is not accurate.

            "claim [Claim]: \"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster interrupted last week's mayoral forum with an important public service announcement: Don't leave your keys in the car. No, really. The plea came in the middle of a discussion on crime, with Foster noting that good police work can't overcome people's lack of common sense. \"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in the city are caused by people leaving their keys in the car,\" Foster said. The problem is so bad, city officials say, that the Police Department created a sassily named mascot Willie Everlern to help spread the message to residents. In a black-and-white video, Everlern is shocked to discover that his car was heisted after he left the keys inside while he walked into a convenience store. We wondered if the situation in St. Petersburg can actually be this bad. Lo and behold, it’s worse. Out of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. That’s 83.4 percent. \"If I were a car thief, I’d move to St. Petersburg,\" said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, when told of the numbers. Scafidi said the percentage might be a \"high-water mark\" in the country. Over the past several years, car technology has made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. Many new cars have transponder keys, which means someone can’t unlock or start the car unless the key fob is close to the vehicle. As a result, St. Petersburg has seen a 70 percent drop in auto thefts over the past decade, Harmon said. As a result, people leaving their keys in their cars has become an increasing source of car thefts in the city. The thefts are crimes of opportunity, so 96 percent of cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas. Most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models. People are just capitalizing on careless driver mistakes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 40 to 50 percent of auto thefts nationwide are due to keys in the car. Just lock your cars, people. As Harmon said, \"It’s not rocket science.\" One other note: It’s technically illegal to leave your car unattended and running. So not only do you run the risk of having your car stolen, the police could issue you a ticket. Our ruling Foster said that 60 percent of car thefts occur because the owner left keys inside the vehicle. In St. Petersburg this year, it’s actually 83.4 percent. An expert said that might be tops in the country. The specific number aside, Foster’s point that many auto thefts can easily be avoided is 100 percent on the mark. We rate this claim True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Amidst unprecedented security measures, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma delivered his tenth State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2017. We fact-checked his speech.EnergyClaim “To date, nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have the electricity.\" Verdict correctSouth Africa’sdevelopment indicatorsshowed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further233,455 were connected in 2014/15and231,012 were connected in 2015/16. Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released.Zuma’s claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016.As of 2016,90,3% of South African householdshad access to electricity for lighting. - Kate WilkinsonEducationClaim \"Among the participating countries [in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in mathematics and 90 points in science.\" Verdict correctThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science.Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested.The 2015 study found that South Africa’s Grade 9 pupils recorded the “biggest positive change”. There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics.The report goes on to note that “South Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015”.While South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa’s Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate WilkinsonSouth African pupils not ‘second worst in the world’ in maths & scienceClaim “Government also settled all debt owed by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students.” Verdict misleadingThe media unit of theNational Student Financial Aid Scheme(NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check toalengthy statement issued by the scheme earlier this year. It stated that “the historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved”.However, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university.First, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students.“Students who are still studying, dropped out or graduated within the stipulated academic years” can have these loan payments effected, the NSFAS statement said.Second, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students’ previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015.Third, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students’ academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meetgraduation requirements during their final year of study.Finally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or “capital” amount owed by the student to the university.Kagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students’ historic debt.NSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand’s NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that “some outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS”.As such, the “historical debt” has not been “settled” but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading.- Vinayak BhardwajClaim \"A total of 173 inappropriate [schools] have been eradicated since 2011.\" Verdict correctThe department of basic education replaces unsafe and “inappropriate” school structures under theAccelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative(Asidi) programme which started in 2011.As of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced,a department presentation to the select committee on basic educationshowed. At the time of Zuma’s speech, the department’s figures showed that173 had been replaced. Thelatest figuredisplayed on the department’s website puts the number of schools at 174.The programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially,496 schoolswere identified as “inappropriate structures”. Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14.- Kate WilkinsonEmploymentClaim “In terms of the 2015 to 2016 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management levels amounted to 72%, while African representation was at 10%. The representation of coloureds stood at 4.5%, and Indians 8.7%.” Verdict incorrectThe commission for employment equity compiles an annual report on employment equity for the department of labour.The data in the report is submitted once a year by designated employers, which include employers who employ 50 or more employees, employers who employ fewer than 50 employees but have a certain annual turnover, as well as municipalities, all levels of government, state-owned companies and educational institutions.The2015/16 annual reportshowed that 68.9% of top management workforce was white, 14.3% was black, 8.6% was Indian, 4.7% was coloured and 3.5% was foreign.The breakdown of management levels by population group:Top management Senior management Professionally qualified Skilled technical Black 14.3% 21.2% 41.2% 58.8% White 68.9% 58.1% 38.0% 22.0% Indian 8.6% 10.2% 8.5% 5.9% Coloured 4.7% 7.4% 9.4% 11.6% Foreign 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% 1.7%Claim “The expanded public works program has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities towards the attainment of the target of 6 million work opportunities by the end of March 2019.” Verdict correctData from theexpanded public works programmesupports Zuma’s claim. Nearly 2.5 million job opportunities were created between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016.Total work opportunities 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 497,624 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 741,540 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 1,103,983 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 154,965 Total 2,498,112Work opportunities are not permanent jobs, however, and in most cases only last a few months.The department of public works notes that “the same individual can be employed on different projects andeach period of employment will be counted as a work opportunity”. So while nearly 2.5 million work opportunities were created, this does not mean that the same number of people benefited from the programme. - Kate WilkinsonClaim “Of the [more than 2 million] work opportunities created, more than 1 million have been taken up by the youth.” Verdict correctThis claim followed on from Zuma’s previous statement, in which he said that “the expanded public works programme has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities”.Africa Check was unable to find fourth quarter figures for 2013/14. However, even without them, theexpanded public works programmereports show that 1,129,516 job opportunities were filled by young people.

By far the largest number of grants were for child support, with more than 12 million people receiving this type. - Julie BourdinGrant type Number Old age grant 3,283,286 War veteran’s grant 185 Disability grant 1,069,802 Grant in aid 159,515 Child support grant 12,039,444 Foster child grant 411,133 Care dependency grant 143,824 Total 17,094,331EnvironmentClaim “We welcome the decline in rhino poaching incidents since October 2015 which is for the first time in a decade.” Verdict unprovenConsolidated figures for rhino poaching in 2016 have not yet been released. The latest figures were provided by the department of environmental affairs in a September 2016media release. This was confirmed to Africa Check by departmental spokesman, Albi Modise.Between January and August 2016, 702 rhinos were poached countrywide, compared to 796 rhinos between January and July 2015 and a total of 1,175 rhino poaching incidents for the whole year, as recorded by theGlobal Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.While this does indicate a decline in the incidents of poached rhinos (40 fewer incidents were recorded in 2015 than in 2014), this is a relatively small decline when compared to the steady increase in poaching incidents since 2008.Africa Check will only be able to verify this claim once the 2016 figures have been released.- Gopolang MakouYear Recorded incidents 2008 83 2009 122 2010 333 2011 448 2012 668 2013 1,004 2014 1,215 2015 1,175CrimeClaim “Within the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit completed 389 forfeiture cases to the value of R349 million.” Verdict correctFollowing a successful investigation or prosecution,the money that is recovered by the statefrom freezing orders is referred to as the value of “completed forfeitures”.The National Prosecuting Authority’s latestannual reportshows that 389 forfeiture cases were completed by the Asset Forfeiture Unit during 2015/2016, like the president said.These completed cases were valued at R349.5 million, exceeding the R210 million that was projected to be recovered by R139.5 million. The annual report credits a focus on high-value cases, improved investigations and “the increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture” for the better-than-projected performance.The table below shows how the 2015/16 results compare to previous years:Financial year Value of completed forfeitures 2009/10 R185 million 2010/11 R212 million 2011/12 R164 million 2012/13 R119 million 2013/14 R296.4 million 2014/15 R1,939 million 2015/16 R349.5 million- Gopolang MakouClaim \"Last year, I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years.\" Verdict correctZuma prefaced this claim by saying that collusion by cartels “squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists”.It is likely that the president was referring to the proclamationsigned in Maylast year which insertedsection 73A into and amended section 74of the existingCompetition Act.The actual amendment act was passed by parliament in 2009, but various provisions of the amendment have been signed into effect periodically,director in the competition practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr,Lara Granville, explained to Africa Check.This amendment act introduced provisions to deal with “other practices that tend to prevent or distort competition in the market for any particular goods or services”, Granville said. Additionally, the act brings about provisions to hold personally accountable those individuals who “cause firms to engage in cartel conduct”.Thepenalties for these offencesare a fine “not exceeding R500,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment”.However, the new penalties could deter people from coming forward with information about collusion, Granville said. “While criminalisation may be an effective deterrent to cartel conduct, it may prevent people blowing the whistle about cartels to the competition tribunal due to fear of prosecution.”- Vinayak BhardwajClaim “Compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98%.” Verdict correctSpeaking about fighting crime, Zuma said one of government’s strategies “is to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again”.The department of correctional services’2015/16 annual reportshows that 51,307 of the 51,937 people (98.78%) released during that period complied with the conditions of their release.However, there are problems with this narrow reading of the figures, the director of the penal programme at theLawyers for Human Rights, Clare Ballard, pointed out to Africa Check.“The ‘compliance’ that the president refers to relates to policing aspects of parole,” Ballard told Africa Check. That is, whether the parolee is at home when supposed to and whether the person is at home or work at a certain time, Ballard explained.The number doesn’t capture opportunities to help parolees escape a life of crime, by receiving drug counselling or career advice.Furthermore, offenders serving life sentences experience significant delays in being granted parole, Ballard explained.South Africaintroduced minimum mandatory sentencesin 1997. In certain instances of rape and with certain types of murders the perpetrator must receive a sentence of life imprisonment, unless there are “substantial and compelling circumstances” that justify a lesser sentence.“The department is clearly overwhelmed by the bottleneck that the minimum sentences have created,” Ballard told Africa Check. Her calculations show that South Africa has more offenders serving life sentences than ever before.“We represent hundreds of life offenders all over the country whose parole application processes have been delayed by years and years, simply because of systemic poor management of the process on the part of the parole boards, the national council of correctional services, and the minister, who has the final say on whether a life offender may be released,” she added.- Vinayak BhardwajHealthClaim “The department of social development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities - in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, the Free State and Eastern Cape.” Verdict correctThenational drug master planis South Africa’s plan for reducing alcohol and substance abuse, spearheaded by theCentral Drug Authority, the body responsible for itsmonitoring and implementation.According to the plan, the departments of social development and health will work together toprovide inpatient treatment facilities at community and tertiary levels.In a2016 parliamentary meeting, the deputy chairperson of the central drug authority, David Bayever, said that R150 million had been secured from treasury to build 4 public treatment centres in provinces that previously did not have these facilities: the Northern Cape, Free State, Limpopo (which, at the time, was completed but not functioning) and the Eastern Cape (which, at the time, was already functioning).National spokesman for the department of social development, Lumka Oliphant, told EWN and Africa Check that a treatment centre in the North West province has since been completed but that the centres in the Northern Cape, Free State as well as Limpopo (contradicting the parliamentary presentation) are still under construction.A year ago, the department said in amedia statementthat the Limpopo facility had already been completed. Africa Check called theSeshego Hospitalnear Polokwane,where the facility is situatedand confirmed that the building has been erected but the centre is currently not operational.Africa Check also made calls to thecentres in the North West(one located at theTaung Provincial Hospitaland another located at theWitrand Psychiatric Hospitalin Potchefstroom). From our calls, we gathered that the Witrand centre is currently open but the Taung facility is not yet operational.Further questions to Oliphant asking when these facilities were expected to be completed and operational were unanswered at the time of publication.(Note: We will update this report when she gets back to us.)- Gopolang Makou & Katleho SekhothoSouth African students from the University of Cape Town listen to Western Cape premier Helen Zille during a meeting at the university in May 2011.

They provided the organisation’s 2017 submission to parliament’s standing committee on finance.The research contained in the submission only looked at a “sample analysis of the top 17 financial services companies by market capitalisation as listed on the JSE” - not the top 100 companies, as Zuma held.The research refers to 31 December 2016 and was conducted by Intellidex , a South African capital markets and financial services research house.The submission made no reference to black-ownership of the JSE equalling 10%.“The study shows that the financial service sector companies have achieved an average of 6% against the direct equity target of 10%,” the NEF told Africa Check. - Kate WilkinsonREAD: Black ownership on SA’s stock exchange - what we know\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget \"roadmap … doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In a Feb. 24, 2011, column in the Washington Post, Matt Miller, a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress, criticized Republican plans for the federal budget. Miller specifically took aim at a \"roadmap\" put forth by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Budget Committee.\"We're so accustomed to political flimflam that, as (the late Democratic Sen.) Daniel Patrick Moynihan might have put it, we're defining truth-telling down,\" Miller wrote. He charged that leading Republicans have so far only offered \"half-truths\" about the long-term budget realities.\"Thanks to House budget chief Paul Ryan, it's possible to measure the size of this fraud. And it's colossal,\" Miller wrote. \"As can never be said often enough, Ryan is absurdly hailed as a fiscal ‘conservative’ for a ‘roadmap’ that doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and that adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then.\"Miller said that Ryan \"pretends we can keep federal taxes at their recent historic levels of 19 percent of gross domestic product as the boomers age. No can do. The math doesn't work. Ryan's endless red ink proves this.\"As Congressional leaders and the White House negotiate over the next federal budget, we thought we’d check whether Miller fairly characterizes Ryan’s proposal -- specifically whether it’s true that Ryan’s roadmap \"doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt.\"First, we turned to Ryan’s roadmap itself. In a summary table, Ryan provided the amounts for outlays, revenues, deficits or surpluses, and debt for every year of the plan through 2083. (Yes, through 2083 -- more on that in a moment.) Ryan’s table offers these figures as a percentage of gross domestic product rather than as dollar amounts.For the question of when the budget reaches balance, Miller is correct. The percentage of GDP shifts from negative (representing a deficit) to positive (a surplus) in 2063. From that point on, the percentage stays in positive territory -- that is, in surplus -- through 2083.An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’s non-partisan arbiter of budgetary figures -- doesn’t list the exact year that surpluses first occur under Ryan’s plan, but it agrees that it will happen sometime between 2060 and 2080. So on this point Miller appears to be correct.How about Miller’s claim that Ryan would add $62 trillion to the debt?We couldn’t find a $62 trillion figure in either Ryan’s roadmap or in the CBO analysis. We looked back at a previous column and discovered that Miller had also mentioned the figure there. Here’s what he wrote:\"According to the Congressional Budget Office, Ryan's plan would result in annual deficits of between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of GDP between now and somewhere after 2040, with a balanced budget coming only around 2063,\" Miller wrote. \"This would add at least $62 trillion to the national debt over the period. (My estimate is conservative mostly because the independent Tax Policy Center says Ryan's tax reforms would produce far less revenue than Ryan required the CBO to assume.)\"In other words, the $62 trillion figure is an estimate that Miller -- not Ryan or CBO -- produced, and it doesn’t cover the debt added by Ryan’s plan through either 2080 (the final year of CBO’s analysis) or 2083 (the final year of Ryan’s projection).Miller told PolitiFact that his $62 trillion estimate was conservative, stopping the count at 2050 rather than the deficit/surplus tipping point of 2063, and using lower annual debt estimates than CBO did.Whether or not Miller's figure is right -- and the number is certainly in the trillions of dollars -- it's important to note that he was selective in choosing his time frame.That’s because between 2063 and 2080, the federal debt under Ryan’s plan is projected to disappear. In fact, by 2083, the debt under Ryan’s plan would actually turn into a surplus -- a surplus equal to one-sixth of the nation’s GDP.These numbers come from Ryan’s proposal, but CBO’s analysis essentially backs them up, agreeing that the national debt would fall to between negative 0.5 percent and positive 0.5 percent of GDP in 2080. In other words, CBO reckons that the debt would be either small, zero, or in a modest surplus by then.So while Miller has a point that it would take Ryan 52 years to balance the budget -- and that perhaps trillions of dollars in debt will be added between now and then -- the columnist leaves out the counterpoint that Ryan’s plan would eliminate the federal debt after an additional 17 to 20 years.There’s also another bit of missing context: Under the status quo, it would take even longer to reach a surplus, and the U.S. would acquire even more debt.There aren’t many budgetary projections that look 69 years into the future. But CBO does produce long-term budget analyses, including one under a scenario in which the current baseline budget numbers are adjusted to include changes to those policies that are widely expected to be enacted.Under this status-quo scenario, CBO sees the deficit growing consistently as a percentage of GDP, from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2020 to 17.2 percent in 2040, 28 percent in 2060 and 42.8 percent in 2080.So under this model there isn’t a surplus in sight at all, at least through 2080.As for debt, the situation is similar. According to CBO, the status-quo model produces debt levels that reach 433 percent of GDP by 2060 and 716 percent of GDP by 2080. The comparable numbers for Ryan’s plan are 77 percent of GDP by 2060 and essentially zero by 2080.By glossing over what happens to the debt under Ryan’s plan between 2063 and 2083, Miller does give a misleading impression of its projected full fiscal impact.Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, calls Miller’s debt assertion \"ridiculous. Yes, Ryan's plan may allow $62 trillion of debt, but that is far, far, far less than what would happen under current law.\"But Miller makes two counter-arguments.First, Miller isn’t advocating the status-quo plan CBO used. To the contrary, his point is that while some of Ryan’s proposed policies are admirable, the lawmaker should be more aggressive about deficits and the debt by proposing tax increases. Such increases, which are anathema to most Republicans, could help reduce the deficit and the debt much more quickly than Ryan’s plan would.Second, 70-year budgetary estimates ought to be taken with a big grain of salt. On the one hand, economists use the tools they have available, and because much of the federal budget is dictated by long-term demographics -- including Social Security and Medicare -- experts in the field say that the numbers are reasonable approximations.Still, 2083 is as long in the future as 1939 is in the past. Any estimates made in 1939 about what the nation’s economy would look like in 2011 would not have accounted for factors that were unimaginable then, from the baby boom to free trade policies to computerization and the Internet.\"Ryan is the one who claims his plan is ‘conservative,’\" Miller told PolitiFact. \"The idea that he runs 62 or 80 or 100 trillion in debt but then pledges to do better when all of us are long dead is silly.\"So where does this leave us?On the one hand, Miller’s statement fails to mention the fact that Ryan’s plan does eventually eliminate the debt, according to CBO -- a sizable achievement when one realizes that under status quo policies, the debt would be more than seven times the size of the nation’s economy. Still, an outcome 70 years from now is subject to a lot of uncertainty, and Miller’s actual statement was phrased carefully. It’s true, as he says, that Ryan’s plan \"doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s,\" and before it gets there, it will probably add trillions of dollars in debt. It’s a close call, but we rate his statement Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Roy Blunt \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" while in Congress.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Jason Kander, a Democrat running against Republican Roy Blunt for one of Missouri’s U.S. Senate seats, says his opponent \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" while in Congress. What are the facts behind this claim? Kander provides sources in this document on his website and even provides quotations from the Congressional Research Service. But providing a source doesn’t necessarily make a claim factual. So we took a deeper look into the legislation itself, and how congressional pay raises occur. In 1989, Congress approved an annual cost-of-living adjustment to member’s pay as part of an ethics reform bill. The yearly adjustment percentage is based on private-sector wage changes and is applied automatically unless denied by a congressional statute. This created a system in which members of Congress can receive pay raises without explicitly voting for them on the record. What Blunt did was vote against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring. Each of the times Blunt is alleged to have increased his pay came between 1997 and 2010, when Blunt was still a member of the House of Representatives for Missouri’s 7th District. Here’s how it breaks down year by year. 1997 Blunt’s first year in Washington was preceded by five consecutive years of Congress voting to not adjust their pay, but that streak would not continue. The Senate and House versions of the 1998 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill (S. 1023 and H.R. 2378, respectively) differed on the inclusion of a pay freeze, with the Senate version supporting no raise. The two chambers agreed to a conference to iron out the differences, with the House voting 229-199 to \"order the previous question,\" which is legalese for ending debate and bringing the measure to an immediate vote. The vote, which Blunt supported, meant that no pay freeze could be added to the bill and sent H.R. 2378 to conference without instructions to stop the automatic pay increase. This led to the Senate wording being dropped from the final bill, which was signed into law on Oct. 10, 1997. Members of Congress’ pay increased 2.3 percent to $136,700. On Oct. 2, 1997, Blunt told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \"I believe keeping the current salary of Congress equal with the rate of inflation is the right thing, and a necessary thing to do to be able to attract people to seek congressional office in the future.\" 1999 through 2007 From 1999 through 2007, similar actions to those in 1997 were taken in the House to order the previous question before an amendment to stop the pay increase could be proposed. For some of these years, the Congressional Research Service said \"it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that Members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity,\" as amendments other than the pay freeze were suggested before the House voted to order the previous question. Some years, however, Representatives made clear their intention to introduce a pay freeze before the vote to order the previous question was taken. Every year from 1999 through 2007, Blunt voted in favor of ordering the previous question. As a result of the automatic increases, the pay of members of Congress increased from $136,700 in 1999 to $169,300 at the start of 2008. 2009 On Feb. 25, 2009, the House voted to add a provision to an omnibus appropriations act that would prohibit the automatic pay adjustment for 2010. Blunt was one of only 24 members of the House to oppose this, with 398 members voting in favor of it. Blunt also voted against the omnibus appropriations act as a whole, but this time was joined by 178 members of the House, with 245 members voting in favor of it. As a result, congressional salaries, including Blunt’s, did not increase. 2010 Well into the recession, bills were being proposed to stop pay adjustments for 2011, instead of just tacking the legislation on as an amendment to a larger bill. Blunt voted in favor of one of these bills, which passed the House 402-15 and went on to become law. So Blunt actually voted against the automatic pay increase in 2010. The vote Kander claims is a vote to increase Blunt’s pay this year comes from the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, which froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years. While this isn’t a direct vote on his own pay, the 1989 ethics reform bill, which began the automatic pay increases for members of Congress, specifies that their pay cannot be increased by a higher percentage in a year than that of general schedule employees. So a vote against this could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases, though it may be even more of a stretch than Kander’s prior claims. While Blunt actually voted in favor of this bill when it was passed in the House 415-3, Kander points to Blunt’s vote against the conference bill, which resolved the differences between the House’s and Senate’s versions of the bill as a vote to increase his own pay. This final version of the bill passed the house 193-165 on Dec. 21, 2010. Our ruling Kander said \"Blunt voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" while in Congress. This is a misleading attack. Blunt did not literally vote to increase his pay 12 times. He voted in support of measures that could have blocked or limited automatic cost-of-living increases from taking effect. Even all of those cases aren’t clear-cut, as sometimes Blunt sided with efforts to stop the automatic pay increase. Kander’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbb9976c-3393-4a9a-aade-aed04f05f843\n",

And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service.\" The voters will decide if the lesser number is significant, but we find Obama's claim of two decades' experience to be accurate. To arrive at this number, we looked closely at Obama's official congressional biography, his professional resume and news articles chronicling his political rise in Illinois. If Obama wins election and takes office in January 2009, he will have served four years in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois. Before that, he was a state senator in Illinois for eight years. He also was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school during that time. His schedule from the school shows him teaching two or three classes in the fall and winter terms — usually Constitutional Law III: Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process; Voting Rights and the Democratic Process; and Current Issues in Racism and the Law. In the spring, he would attend the Illinois legislative sessions. It seems a fairly safe bet that, like most legislators, his constituent work — fielding phone calls and helping people in his district — went on year round. Press reports indicate he did a small amount of private law practice during the summer. So that's eight years as a public official in Illinois, bringing our total to 12 years. To get to 20 years of experience, we still need eight years from Obama's career prior to holding public office. Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983. He worked for a year as a financial analyst; in his memoir he said he spent his days behind a computer terminal, \"checking the Reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages across the globe\" and feeling like \"a spy behind enemy lines.\" He gave up that job to go into community organizing, work he felt was more important politically. He worked three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. We won't count the junior-level business experience as working \"on behalf of families who are having a hard time,\" but the community organizing work does seem to fit the bill. That brings his work experience to 15 years. At Harvard, Obama began to receive national attention. He became the first black president of theHarvard Law Reviewand was recruited heavily by law firms around the country. (He met his future wife, Michelle Robinson, as a summer associate at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin.) He graduated in 1991. He ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992, and then accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. The firm specialized in political and civil rights work and neighborhood economic development work. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993. He was elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1996 and took office in 1997, so his full-time work after law school comprises five years. That gets us to 20 years. (During these years, Obama also worked on his career as an author. His memoirDreams from my Fatherwas published in 1994 and reprinted after his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. A follow-up,The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, was published in 2006. His personal financial disclosure statements show that those books earned him $1.8-million in 2005 and 2006, the majority of his income.) The other part of Obama's claim is that his experience is \"on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream.\" We take that to mean his experience is broadly in the field of public service, and that too is an accurate claim. The bulk of Obama's professional experience is either in elected office or working for a nonprofit, a university or a civil rights law firm. Obama's 20 years of experience are 15 years short of Clinton's, but it's worth noting that Obama is 14 years younger than Clinton. Voters will decide whether the gap between 35 years and 20 years of experience is significant, but we find Obama's statement about his own experience to be True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The Texas Senate passed a resolution on April 2 that declared an emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border and called on Congress to fully fund border security efforts The resolution, filed by Republican Sen. Paul Bettencourt from Houston, was adopted in a party-line vote after more than two hours of debate. During discussion about the proposal, Bettencourt stressed the urgency of the resolution, noting that the Senate had to respond quickly to what he described as a worsening situation at the border. \"194,000 criminal aliens booked into Texas jails from 2011-2019 were charged with more than 299,000 criminal offenses,\" the resolution reads. Bettencourt’s numbers come from state data about people here illegally and they're accurate. But, experts say the figures take things out of context and don’t paint an accurate picture of any possible correlation between immigration status and criminal activity. Texas DPS data shows charges, convictions Cristie Ingram, a staffer for Bettencourt, said the data in the resolution came from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which tracks crime statistics related to people in the country illegally. The latest data on the agency’s website shows that between June 1, 2011, and March 31, 2019, there were 194,000 people classified as \"illegal aliens\" booked into local Texas jails. In total, those 194,000 people were charged with \"more than 303,000 criminal offenses\" that have resulted in \"over 123,000 convictions\" for homicide, assault, burglary and other charges. Ingram said Bettencourt and his staff \"stand behind the data\" and used numbers from the entire eight-year period because that is the time period available from the state. She did not return a request for comment asking why the resolution looks at charges in criminal cases instead of convictions. The numbers in Bettencourt’s resolution are the same as those published by the state, but experts said the implication in the resolution that people here illegally commit a disproportionate number of crimes or increase the crime rate is misleading. Graham Ousey, a sociology professor at the College of William and Mary who studies criminology, said counting the total criminal charges filed against people here illegally does not offer an accurate characterization of that community of people as a whole. He said a major flaw in the state’s data is the fact that the numbers only reflect criminal offenses recorded for individuals who are already in jail. \"If you were to go to any prison system and you selected 194,000 people across eight years of time and add up all of those offenses, you’re likely to get pretty high numbers,\" Ousey said. \"You’re self-selecting on a population that is criminal in their behavior.\" He noted that past criminology research has found that a small percentage of the population is responsible for \"a disproportionate share of crimes committed.\" \"A report like this, or a study that selects a sample that is (incarcerated), they’re tapping into that higher crime, smaller subset,\" he said. \"So of course the offenses that would show up would be greater in number.\" But these numbers are trying to meld two things together that aren’t necessarily related — criminal activity and immigration status. \"It’s like saying, ‘Hey there’s all these crimes being committed by people who have been arrested,’ and then attaching that or making a link to criminal aliens,\" Ousey added. \"It’s clearly being cherry picked in a way that’s trying to create an association between someone’s immigrant status and their behavior.\" The DPS website notes that the information it publishes does not \"attempt to allege that foreign nationals in the country illegally commit more crimes than other groups.\" \"It simply identifies thousands of crimes that should not have occurred and thousands of victims that should not have been victimized because the perpetrator should not be here,\" it reads. Ousey said it’s true that, \"if an offender and a victim aren’t in the same space at the same time, crime doesn’t occur,\" but removing that one offender (or population group) would not end crime. \"The only way to get rid of crime all together is to get rid of all of the people,\" he said. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed and said the state’s argument is \"statistically nonsensical.\" \"What matters is not the total number of crimes, but the crime rate,\" he said. \"That tells you how threatened you are by criminals.\" Crime rate vs. totals Nowrasteh conducted research on arrest and conviction rates for people here illegally and native-born Americans using data from 2015, the most recent and complete information available at the time of his study. He found that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the United States and that \"illegal immigrants have lower incarceration rates nationwide and in the state of Texas relative to native-born Americans.\" He also found that in Texas, \"illegal immigrants had a criminal conviction rate 50 percent below that of native-born Americans.\" Nowrasteh’s researched looked at these rates within each subpopulation, meaning he looked at things like rate of homicide convictions among unauthorized immigrants and separately among legal immigrants and native-born Americans. Michael Light, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said totals for charges or convictions, like the number offered in Bettencourt’s resolution, are fine to consider, but they don’t offer much insight into overall safety or behavior. \"Imagine I were to claim that women are less violent than men, which is as close to a social fact that we have in criminology,\" he said in an email. \"And one were to reply saying that this is not true because in 2015 over 78,000 women were arrested for violent crimes, and nearly 1,000 were arrested for homicide according to FBI records. Those statistics in no way contradict the original statement that men tend to be more violent.\" Light said if data showed that the rate of violent crime is higher among men than women, eliminating women would mean that the violent crime rate for the entire population would be the violent crime rate among men. \"In other words, our chance of being violently victimized would be substantially higher were the population of women removed, even though they have committed tens of thousands of offenses,\" he said. \"The same logic holds for removing immigrants.\" Light said research has shown low rates of crime within immigrant communities, compared to native-born Americans, and that areas with high migrant populations tend to have lower overall crime rates than those with smaller immigrant populations. \"Those statements are not contradicted by stating the number of offenses committed by immigrants,\" he said. Our rating Bettencourt’s resolution declaring a crisis at the border reads, \"194,000 criminal aliens booked into Texas jails from 2011-2019 were charged with more than 299,000 criminal offenses.\" These numbers come from data published by DPS. His figures are right, but they don't tell the whole story. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Dozens of small airports around the country were touched by federal budget cuts under a decision announced March 22, 2013, by the Federal Aviation Administration. A total of 149 air traffic control towers operated by private contractors will be shut down, the agency decided. The decision was one of the most high profile and broad based actions to come under the politically charged sequestration cuts. Eight Wisconsin airports are on the list, including Crites Field in Waukesha, which lies in the district of U.S. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls). Sensenbrenner issued a news release March 22, 2013, criticizing the FAA decision, saying the \"contract towers\" save money and have fewer safety problems. He also noted that the FAA’s budget was being cut 5 percent, but the spending for the contract towers was dropping 75 percent. Sensenbrenner added: \"Not coincidentally, 75 percent of the towers the Obama Administration is closing are located in Republican Congressional Districts.\" Critics have said the administration is playing politics with the budget cuts. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of the first we’ve seen that quantified this complaint. Are 75 percent in GOP districts? We asked the congressman’s office for evidence to support his claim. That’s when we started to feel some turbulence. \"That information came from a member of the aviation subcommittee,\" responded Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller in an email. We asked him to be more precise about the source of the claim and the actual number. Three days after our initial inquiry, Miller responded: \"We have reissued the press release noting the correction. I appreciate you pointing it out.\" Wait a minute. We didn’t offer a correction. We only asked a question. The reissued news release carried the notation \"updated,\" and this information: \"(A statistic in the previous release was unverifiable).\" Miller elaborated in an email: \"We received (the statistic) from the office of a member on the Aviation subcommittee and are unwilling to throw anyone under the bus. We couldn’t verify the statistic we received and therefore issued a retraction. Unfortunately, Rep. Sensenbrenner is unavailable for an interview today.\" Still curious on the number, we started searching, emailing and mapping. Sensenbrenner’s claim was repeated in several news accounts of his reaction to the budget cuts, including on Fox News and in the Janesville Gazette. (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel coverage did not include the claim.) We did come across a similar claim from another House member, U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Penn.). \"Two out of every three towers slated for closure are in Republican Congressional districts,\" Pitts said in a March 7, 2013 news release. \"Unfortunately, this political game has real implications for public safety.\" The statement by Pitts, who is not a member of the aviation subcommittee, came before the FAA announced its final tower closing list. At the time, there was a preliminary list of 189 airports. Pitts, whose district includes one of the airports, did some analysis of that preliminary list, said spokesman Andrew Wimer. \"We had some of our interns here look up some of the ZIP codes,\" of the affected towers and then cross referenced that information with congressional districts, Wimer said. The result: Just under 66 percent were in Republican districts, Wimer said. Wimer declined to release the data, and he would not say what the survey results say about the final closing list. So we’re on our own to test Sensenbrenner’s claim. We plotted the 149 towers set for closure on a map. And then we cross referenced by party with congressional districts. Of the 149 airports slated for closure, four fall inside two separate congressional districts. Of those four, two sit in two Republican districts while the other two straddle a Republican and a Democratic district. The overall breakdown of the House is 234 Republicans to 201 Democrats, which means Republicans have about 54 percent of the seats. There is another factor at play: Many of the affected airports are in less-populated rural areas that tend to lean Republican. Let’s land this item. Arguing politics were involved in the FAA’s tower closing decision, Sensenbrenner said 75 percent of the towers set to close were in Republican districts. Three days after we asked about it, Sensenbrenner removed the claim and, in at least in one version of the statement, included a note saying a previous version relied on \"unverifiable\" information. It would have been more accurate to say that the statement was unverified. We verified the numbers. And we rate the statement False.

            "[Evidences]:With elections in Uttar Pradesh scheduled early next year, all major political contenders in the fray are gearing up for the same. The recently concluded panchayat elections in the state threw up mixed results, forcing leaders back to the drawing boards. Amid this, a controversial letter claiming that accelerating the Covid-19 vaccination process can prove to be a game-changer in UP is doing the rounds on social media. The letter, allegedly issued by Union Home minister Amit Shah’s office, has been addressed to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Beginning on a complimentary note, the letter applauds Yogi for his efforts in handling the second wave of the pandemic. It then lays emphasis on completing registration of people in the age group of 18 years and above for Covid vaccination in Western UP by mid-July. “This vaccination registration process is a key to success in upcoming Uttar Pradesh Elections 2022,” the letter concludes. Union Home ministry officials have confirmed to India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) that the letter is fake. Shah has not written any such letter to Yogi. AFWA probe Had any such letter been written by Shah to Modi, mainstream media would’ve surely covered it. We contacted the Union Home ministry for clarification on the said letter. Responding to our email, Nitin Wakankar, Director General (Media & Communications) at MHA, called the letter fake. A closer look at the viral letter reveals grammatical errors. One of the sentences starts with “Now more efforts required”, while the correct format should have been “Now more efforts are required”. The word “mid” has been unnecessarily capitalised as well. It is unlikely that a letter issued by the MHA will have such errors. The viral letter bears a serial number “HMP 28647021”. MHA officials confirmed to us that no letter bearing the said serial number has been issued by them. Two letters issued by Amit Shah earlier can be seen here and here. Hence, it can be concluded that a forged letter in Shah’s name is being circulated on social media to mislead people. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim In a letter addressed to the UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Union Home minister Amit Shah said maximising Covid-19 vaccination registrations can ensure success in the 2022 assembly election.

            "[Evidences]:As presidential electors across the U.S. formally affirmed Joe Biden’s win, some social media users hoped that Republican electors who cast symbolic votes for President Donald Trump in key swing states could secure a second Trump term. One of these posts makes a series of misleading claims to craft an intricate theory of how Trump could still win the election despite losing both the electoral and popular votes. \"PA/GA/WI/MI/AZ/NV,\" reads a Dec. 15 Instagram post. \"6 states will cast their votes for Trump AND for Biden. A state has sent dueling electors only once when 3 states sent dueling electors for Hyde and Tillman...\" The post goes onto claim that this development will lead to a second Trump term. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Multiple legal experts and academics told us that the post is not based in fact. It’s \"somewhere between fantasy and hogwash,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Before a presidential election, state political parties nominate their candidates for the office of presidential elector. Under Article II of the Constitution, each state legislature has complete discretion as to how it chooses its electors. Since the late 1800s, all electors have been appointed by popular vote. (Electors in Maine and Nebraska are chosen by popular vote at the congressional district rather than state level.) During presidential elections, a vote for a particular presidential candidate is actually a vote for the slate of electors nominated by that candidate’s political party. The electors that win the popular vote in each state become eligible to cast votes in the electoral college for their party’s candidate. This year, Biden won the election in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, and so his electors in those states became legally eligible to cast votes for him. On Dec. 14, these electors gathered in state capitols and signed six \"certificates of ascertainment\" along with state governors, cementing Biden’s win. However, in key swing states, would-be Trump electors — often referred to as \"shadow electors\" — gathered on the same day as the certified Biden electors and cast symbolic votes for Trump. Election law experts told us that the votes of these shadow electors, however, have no legal significance because they were not certified by state governments. Since Biden won the popular vote in all states mentioned in the post, the only electors with legal standing to cast electoral votes are those approved by their state’s respective governors and certified pursuant to state law, said Rebecca Green, professor and co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School. All of the legally-recognized, state-appointed electors in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada cast their votes for Biden. \"In no case among the states in question were Republican slates approved by their state's respective governors and certified to be electors,\" said Robert Alexander, an electoral college expert and professor of political science at Ohio Northern University. \"This means their votes should not be counted.\" It’s inaccurate to say that these states sent \"dueling slates\" of electors to the House to be counted. In each state, only a single slate of electors has received legal backing. Some of the uncertified Trump electors have justified their actions by comparing themselves to Hawaiian electors during the 1960 election. In that case, Democratic electors in the state cast a conditional vote for John F. Kennedy even though the official electors had already voted for Nixon. During the vote-counting process, the House and Nixon himself recognized Kennedy as the state’s winner. However, legal experts told us that the events of the 1960 election have little relevance to the current situation. In Hawaii, a court-backed recount was already underway at the time both slates of electors cast their votes. Although Nixon had won the initial count by a 141-vote margin, the results of the recount seemed to be favoring Kennedy. When Kennedy did win the recount, Hawaii Gov. William Quinn withdrew the state’s backing from the Republican electoral votes and certified Kennedy as the winner. \"The state first certified Nixon, then certified Kennedy, and Congress counted the Kennedy electors – while making clear it was not establishing a precedent in doing so,\" said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at the New York University School of Law. By their own definition, the shadow electors would only come into play if courts attempted to throw out the officially-cast electoral votes. And courts across the country have repeatedly affirmed that Biden legitimately won the swing states in question. \"The legal basis for the competing slates of electors here have been rejected by dozens of state and federal courts throughout the nation, repeatedly,\" said Michael Morley, assistant professor at Florida State University College of Law. The post says that the current situation is similar to the \"Hyde and Tillman\" election, an apparent misspelling of the Hayes-Tilden election of 1876. Legal experts and academics rejected the comparison to the 1876 election, where multiple states sent dueling slates of electors to the House, and a political bargain struck between the parties handed the presidency to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. \"The current statutory framework didn’t even exist at that time,\" said Morley. \"Right off the bat, it’s different.\" The Electoral Count Act of 1887, a federal law written in part due to the confusion during the 1876 election, established new guidelines for the counting of electoral votes that are still in place today. An Instagram post says that \"6 states will cast their (electoral) votes for Trump AND for Biden,\" which will lead to a second Trump term. Although unofficial shadow electors did meet to cast votes for Trump in these states, these votes have no legal standing and do not qualify as certified electoral votes. The conditional electoral votes cast by these uncertified electors would only come into play if courts attempted to throw out the officially-cast electoral votes, and courts across the nation have repeatedly affirmed the legitimacy of Biden’s win in these states.

            "[Evidences]:A two-month-old vlog by former senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. that bears false and misleading claims about the Philippines’ electoral system continues to circulate on social media. It was posted Feb. 20 on his Facebook (FB) and YouTube accounts after the Supreme Court (SC) — sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) — unanimously dismissed his poll protest against Vice President Leni Robredo. The six-minute video revolved around Marcos’ allegation that the automated election system leads to cheating and fraud, and presented a “hybrid election system” as an alternative. The clip began with the erroneous claim of Marcos’ lawyer Vic Rodriguez that the PET dismissed only the former lawmaker’s second cause of action for a recount in select pilot provinces, and not his third cause of action to annul votes in three provinces in Mindanao due to alleged fraud. An updated SC briefer on Feb. 16 noted that the tribunal had dismissed Marcos’ “entire electoral protest.” This was again confirmed by the full SC decision, released on April 19, which stated: “All told, the third cause of action fails and is likewise dismissed.” (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Understanding the PET’s junking of Marcos’ poll protest vs. Robredo) VERA Files Fact Check looked into Marcos’ claims in his Feb. 20 vlog and identified one that was false, three misleading, and another that needed context. Read on to know more about each claim: On the speed of manual counting Latest data show that the number of voters per precinct can range from 200 to 1,000, according to Commission on Elections (Comelec) Spokesperson James Jimenez. He added that the manual counting of votes from 600 to 800 voters in a matter of hours has been “proven [false] time and again by COMELEC studies.” In a Viber message to VERA Files Fact Check, Jimenez, also the director of the Comelec Education and Information Department, said “even under clinical conditions, it has taken hours just to complete a count of far fewer ballots.” Historical records from election watchdog National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL) show that manual tallying and counting of votes in a precinct with 200 to 250 voters could take five to 24 hours, according to National Council Member Angel Averia. On countries that use ‘manual voting’ Marcos said this as a preface to his claim that many countries have stopped “electronic voting.” The accompanying graphic in his video did not use his wording and instead read: “209 out of 227 countries still use paper ballots.” This is misleading. Using paper ballots does not necessarily mean a country is not automating any part of the voting process. A cursory search led VERA Files Fact Check to an Oct. 30, 2020 article by United States-based think tank Pew Research Center, which reflected Marcos’ figure: that 209 of 227 countries tracked by the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network use paper ballots. This includes the Philippines, where paper ballots are manually marked during polls. What is automated in the country’s 2016, 2019, and the upcoming 2022 elections are the counting, canvassing, and transmission of votes. Two of the three countries that Marcos cited as having “stopped” electronic voting — Finland and Ireland — had tried a type of voting that was fully electronic, beginning with the choosing of candidates done through a machine. On countries returning to manual voting Marcos quoted a 2018 article about the case of Finland, where a working group appointed by its Ministry of Justice concluded in a 2017 feasibility study that “online voting should not be introduced in general elections as its risks are greater than its benefits.” Encyclopedia Britannica defines online voting as a system in which votes can be cast through the Internet without going to an election precinct or manually filling out ballots. It is different from electronic voting, in which choosing candidates is done through the aid of a computer. The Philippines does not employ online voting. Neither does it do electronic voting in the strictest sense. It uses an automated election system that uses paper ballots to record votes, and then tabulates, canvasses, and transmits the results of vote counting electronically. On the percentage of votes counted in 2013 While only 76% of total votes were transmitted in the Comelec’s transparency server during the May 2013 national and local elections, as reported by the media, this was “not the basis for the official count,” according to Jimenez. The transparency server merely mirrors the data received by the Comelec in its central server — the “central repository of all election results” — from the vote counting machines and board of canvassers in real time. (VERA FILES FACT SHEET: 3 things you should know about Comelec’s transparency server – Vera Files) In case of failed electronic transmission, Jimenez said vote results “can still be physically delivered via storage media to the next canvassing level” in accordance with the Comelec’s contingency plans. Jimenez also told a joint congressional hearing in June 2019 that 1,051 or 1.22% of 85,769 vote counting machines (VCMs) that malfunctioned were replaced, while 2,246 defective SD cards, or 1.31% of those actually used, were reconfigured during the 2019 midterm elections. In a press conference on May 14, 2019, a day after the elections, Comelec said 1,253 out of 1,665 defective SD cards were replaced. VERA Files Fact Check’s request for official data from Comelec on the transmission rate of votes to the central server, total votes consolidated and canvassed, and the number of storage media physically delivered to the canvassers during the 2013 national elections, remains pending. The same goes for the total number of defective SD cards and VCMs which had to be replaced or repaired during the 2019 elections. On the youth’s voter pessimism While the headline flashed in the vlog presents Filipino youth losing faith in the election, the actual 2019 Deutsche Welle story featured sentiments from only two Filipino students. The students said they lost their faith in the political system because “candidates backed by the administration always win,” and because the people who won in the election were “likely to protect the interests of President Rodrigo Duterte.” Neither the Social Weather Stations nor Pulse Asia, which are independent polling bodies in the country, have conducted official surveys on the topic. To support Marcos’ opinion, the video also misled viewers by flashing an informal February 2021 poll by website PH Pulse (phpulse.com) that asked netizens why they have not yet registered to vote in the next national elections in 2022. While 375 of 626 respondents (59.9%) answered “walang tiwala sa sistema (no trust in the system),” it does not elaborate any further. The non-disclosure of the poll’s demographic makes it impossible to see the breakdown of responses by age.

            "[Evidences]:“How is finding 39 missing children in a double wide trailer in Georgia NOT the biggest news story in America?” reads an August 28, 2020 Facebook post shared more than one million times. “Can someone - anyone - explain to me why finding 39 missing KIDS in a double wide trailer in Georgia not the biggest news story on the planet ??” reads another post shared 34,000 times. The claim was also shared on Facebook here and here, on Twitter here and on Instagram here. Some posts, for example here, here and here, spread the claim using the hashtag #SaveTheChildren. Supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory -- which alleges that powerful Democrats and Hollywood figures engage in child sex trafficking and abuse -- have hijacked the hashtag to stoke fears on social media about sexual predators. President Donald Trump has done nothing to tamp down the theory, and said of Q supporters: “they like me very much.” The US Marshals Service announced on August 27 that 39 children were indeed found over two weeks as part of “Operation Not Forgotten.\" However, spokesman Dave Oney told AFP by email that the children were found in multiple locations, not in a double-wide trailer. The children were mostly found in Georgia -- where all 39 were reported missing, according to Oney -- but in 15 different counties, not one trailer. Others were found in South Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Florida, Kentucky and Michigan. He said that 15 of the children were identified as victims of trafficking, while “13 of the 39 children were located during the operation and determined to be with a proper custodian.” The rest of them were victims of parental kidnappings, or runaways from foster or adoptive homes or from juvenile justice custody, he said. “These missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions,” the US Marshals press release said. Oney sent AFP a chart outlining the counties and states where each of the children were found during the operation, available below. Despite claims that mainstream media failed to cover the story, the results of “Operation Not Forgotten” were reported on or before the date of the posts by Fox News here as well as local media here, here and here, and subsequently by CBS and CNN. Oney said “there’s plenty of misinformation” circulating about child trafficking and encouraged people “to do their due diligence.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:It has been claimed that new Rs 1,000 currency notes are going to be issued. Is the government coming out with a new Rs 1,000 note? The currency notes of Rs 1,000 had gone out of circulation during demonetisation in 2016 and were replaced by Rs 2,000 notes. But lately, there have been reports about RBI stopping the printing of Rs 2,000 notes. Since then, the social media has been abuzz with photographs of Rs 1,000 currency notes that are going to be put in circulation soon. Facebook user Akhil Chaturvedi uploaded a photo of a currency note and said, \"New note of 1000 first in your group\". The photo carries an impression of Mahatma Gandhi on the left along with an image of a rupee in the centre and a stamp of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the right. The archived version of this post can be seen here. People, who believed the news, said, \"So many frequent changes with currency can only be termed as mockery with the currency of the country.\" Some other Facebook users have used two pictures of the note to give an impression of the front and back of the new note. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral photograph is only an artist's impression and there is no such note that is going to be issued. AFWA probe On close scrutiny of the viral photo of new Rs 1,000 currency notes, AFWA found that on the right corner of the note, an \"artistic imagination\" can be clearly seen. This means that it is not a real image. Just below it, 'I promise to pay the bearer the sum of one thousand prue\" is written instead of 'rupees' in the end. Had it been a real note, then 'rupees' would not have been misspelt. Also, the viral currency note photo carries a signature of Mahatma Gandhi instead of the current RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das. Das had tweeted in 2017 about no plans of issuing Rs 1,000 currency notes. Also, on the website of the RBI, there is no notification that one can find about the new Rs 1,000 currency notes being issued. The RBI does put out press releases when new notes are issued. It had done the same on Nov 8, 2016, when new Rs 2000 currency notes rupee note and Rs 500 currency notes rupee notes were to be issued. AFWA reached out to Yogesh Dayal, Chief General Manager, Department of Communication, RBI who said, \"There's no notification from our side. All communications from the RBI appear on our website. Please don't believe in rumours.\" Conclusion The viral image of Rs 1,000 that is being circulated on social media is clearly an artist's impression. No new Rs 1,000 currency notes are being issued by the RBI right now. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim New Rs 1,000 currency notes are going to be issued. Conclusion The viral photo of the notes is an artist's impression. No new Rs 1,000 currency notes are going to be issued by the RBI.

            "[Evidences]:The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a South African political party, launched its election manifesto on 2 February 2019 in the country's Gauteng province. The national election is scheduled for 8 May 2019.The party claims that \"landlessness and joblessness among black South Africans are at crisis levels, posing the biggest challenges that confront South African society today\".This report fact-checks five claims about land occupation, school dropout rates, unemployment, land redistribution and gender balance.Claim ”80% of the population continues to occupy less than 10% of South Africa’s land” Verdict incorrectThe EFF basesits claimon ownership data and the size of the African and coloured population.The party’s national communications manager, Sixolise Gcilishe, explained how it was calculated:Total land area: 122 million hectaresminus 67% – white-owned agricultural landminus 14% – state landminus 5% – land owned by Indians*equals 14% of land “left for black African and coloured South Africans”, who make up 88% of the population*This number is rounded off. The number the EFF provided was 4.82%.This fact-check evaluates each of the EFF’s assumptions stated above.Is 67% of SA land white-owned agricultural land?In 1993, the year before South Africa’s first democratic election, a Stats SA agricultural census estimated the country had about82 million hectaresof agricultural land. The governmenthas referredto this land as “white-owned agricultural land”.This was 67% of South Africa’s total land.The EFF said work by Plaas, theInstitute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studiesat the University of the Western Cape, was the source of the 67% used in its calculation.The number is contained ina2013 Plaas fact-checkon land distribution co-authored by Prof Cherryl Walker, a professor of sociology at the University of Stellenbosch. She said the 67% was commercial farmland historically reserved for white ownership, but it shouldn't be assumed to be the share in white hands today.Since 1994 black people have acquired some of this land through private sales and loans.Prof Ben Cousins of Plaas described the EFF estimates as “highly misleading”. He said much of the land acquired for land reform since 1994 was “no doubt farmland, and no longer forms part of the 67% of the total land area formerly in the hands of white farmers”.Areport on land redistributioncommissioned by parliament says “some land acquired or transferred may not be commercial agricultural land… Nonetheless, we may presume that most may be considered land zoned for agriculture outside of the former Bantustans”.How much agricultural land is owned by white people? The available data is limited.According to the2017 state land audit, farms and other agricultural land amounted to just over 111 million hectares in 2015. The audit only provides a racial breakdown for agricultural land owned by individuals,some37 million hectares. It estimates that white people own 72% of this land – 26.7 million hectares.AnAgri SAland auditestimatedthat white farmers owned 68.5 million hectares of agricultural land in 2016. This includes land owned by companies and trusts and amounts to 56% of total land.Agricultural economist Wandile Sihlobo gave Africa Check an estimate of agricultural land not owned by white people.It identifies 17.5 million hectares of farmland as “not owned by whites”. The calculation was done with the help of agricultural economist Prof Johann Kirsten of the University of Stellenbosch and based on data from 2015 and 2017.It is made up of agricultural land owned by the state, redistributed and restored land and a “guesstimate” of the land bought by willingblack buyersfrom willing white sellers. It also includes a hectare equivalent of money paid in land restitution claims.AFebruary 2019Plaas working paper, co-authored by Kirsten, containsan updated calculation, which relies on 2018 data from the department of rural development and land reform.South African land redistribution numbers Type Land (hectares) Agricultural land acquired by the state since 1994 and still held by the state for land reform purposes 2,289,063 Redistribution 4,901,150 Restitution 3,692,294 Subtotal 10,882,507 Private transactions (without the involvement of the department of rural development and land reform) 1,968,057 Total 12,850,564Source:Plaas working paper(Note: This calculation does not include a hectare equivalent of compensation paid for restoration.)Using these redistribution numbers, and an estimated 643,995 hectares of agricultural land acquired by the state for development purposes, it estimates that 64.8 million hectares of farmland (53% of total land) is owned by white people.The available data therefore does not support the EFF’s assumption that 82 million hectares of agricultural land – 67% of South Africa’s land – is in white hands.Is state land unoccupied?The 2017 state land audit focused on privately owned land. The previous audit, published in 2013, identified17.1 million hectares or 14%of the total land as state-owned land.ButCousinssaid “state land” could be a misleading category. “It includes land held for nature conservation, state forests, water and defence force use. It also includes [land] in the traditional areas.”The 2019 Plaas working paperestimatesland under traditional tenure to be 18.4 million hectares – or 15% of total land.Economist Johann Bornman, given as a source for calculations of land size in the working paper, said that in 2018 the rural development and land reform department updated its estimate of land in the former homelands to this number.Dr Aninka Claassens, chief researcher at theLand and Accountability Research Centre, said the EFF “seems to ignore the fact that black South African have underlying rights to all the land in the former homelands, which is state land”.(Note: In the explanation of its calculation, the EFF said it was “almost impossible to scientifically determine” how state land was occupied. We have asked Stats SA to help us determine who occupies land in the former homelands and will update this fact-check once we have the results.)How much land do Indian South Africans own?The 2017 state land auditfoundthat 77% of land (94 million hectares) was privately owned.But only the race of individual owners of37.8 million hectarescould be determined. And these numbers may not be spot-on.The deeds registry does not record the race of land owners. In cases where the race could not be derived from Stats SA data, names and surnames were used. “The indirect extraction of race data… exposed the land audit to the risk of under- or over-reporting,” the audit report says.The EFF calculation assumes 5% of South Africa’s total land (5.9 million hectares)is owned by Indians. But this is not supported by the land audit, which puts individual Indian ownership at 2.1 million hectares, including sectional title property.The rural development and land reform departmentpreviously toldAfrica Check it did not include sectional title units when calculating land owned by individuals “as they include units in high-rise buildings such as flats, office buildings… which may distort the numbers”.Individual land ownership by race in South Africa Race Farms and agricultural holdings Erven Sectional title Total hectares Share of SA land Indian 5% 8% 5% 2.1 million 2% African 4% 30% 17% 1.5 million 1% Coloured 14% 8% 21% 5.4 million 4% White 72% 49% 45% 27 million 22%Source: 2017 state land audit (Note: Percentages don’t add up to 100% because the categories “co-ownership” and “other” are left out.)Indian people may own land through trusts, companies and community organisations but there is no data on this.The same goes for African and coloured people, who own 6.9 million hectares of individually owned land or close to 6% of the total land. Coloured and African people together make up close to 90% of the population,according to StatsSA’s 2018 mid-year population estimates.What’s missing?The 2017 land audit only gives data on the race of the owners of about a third of the land. A breakdown by race for other types of private ownership is not available.It is also silent on who occupies this land – in some cases, owners do not occupy their land – as well as on who occupies land in the former homelands.The EFF’s calculation also does not take into account erven and sectional title units owned by white people.Verdict: IncorrectThe EFF’s calculation makes assumptions about ownership to support a claim about the occupation of land. It incorrectly assumes white people own 82 million hectares of agricultural land and overestimates land individually owned by Indians. It is therefore incorrect.Claim ”South Africa has one of the highest school dropout rates” Verdict incorrectThe EFF’s claim applies to a worldwide comparison, the party’s national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe confirmed. She referred us tothree documentsto support the statement.The common thread in these documents is work done by Professor Martin Gustafsson, an education economist and member of theResearch on Socioeconomic Policygroup at the University of Stellenbosch. However, Gustafsson does not agree that his work supports the EFF’s claim.“In fact, as far as secondary [school] completion is concerned – that’s essentially what this is about – we’re fairly normal for a middle-income country,” he said.Measuring dropout ratesGustafsson said it was “widely accepted” that the dropout rate was difficult to calculate, “especially in developing countries, where data systems are limited”.However, he said, education planners regardedthe definitionof the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) as useful: “The proportion of pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who are no longer enrolled in the next school year.”Gustafsson noted that the Unesco definition related to individual grades. “So one can talk about a dropout rate for Grade 10, another one for Grade 11 and so on.”One of the alternative methods to calculate the dropout rate is to use data from household surveys to determine what proportion of the population has obtained a matric certificate.Gustafsson said this method was not ideal, but was an “adequate stopgap”. It was the method used by the department of basic education in response to a parliamentary question about dropout rates in June last year.What is SA’s dropout rate?Thewritten replycontains an estimated dropout rate for those born between 1990 and 1992.Information from Statistics South Africa’s (Stats SA) General Household Survey for 2014 to 2016 was used to estimate that 51.5% of these people had completed Grade 12.We asked the department of basic education to provide more recent calculations if they were available, but it failed to respond to our query.International comparisonsOne of the documents the EFF referred to in support of its claim is a2011 working paperauthored by Gustafsson, but it did not include a worldwide comparison.The working paper looked at Grade 12 completion rates in 14 countries, including Turkey, Brazil and Chile, based on data from 2003 to 2009. South Africa was ranked 12th.Gustafsson referred Africa Check to Unesco’s upper secondary school completion rates as a source of more recent data that would allow for a global comparison.Based on these figures, the department’s2018 matric examination reportconcluded that “the upper secondary education completion [Grade 12] rate for South Africa has been equal to that of middle-income countries in general in recent years”.We compared the average upper secondary education completion rates of68 countries for which Unesco data were available– for the five years from 2014 to last year – and found that 38 countries had lower completion rates than South Africa.Gustafsson said while South Africa’s secondary completion rate was “fairly normal for a middle-income country”, we should aim to increase it, as many other countries are doing.He warned that “defining our vast educational inequalities only in terms of school completion would be incorrect. Many of our inequalities relate to the quality of education, not the years of schooling completed by young people.”Verdict: IncorrectThe EFF’s claim that South Africa’s school dropout rate is among the worst in the world is incorrect. Unesco data for 2014 to last year show that South Africa was in the top 50% of 68 countries based on secondary school completion.Claim ”Close to 40% of South Africans who need jobs are unemployed, meaning that more than nine million South Africans who need jobs and are capable of working cannot find employment.” Verdict correctStats SA’sQuarterly Labour Force Surveymeasures unemployment in two ways – according to the narrower, official definition and according to the expanded definition.The agency’s acting chief director for labour statistics, Malerato Mosiane, explained: “The difference between the official and expanded definition of unemployment is that the job search criterion is relaxed in the expanded definition.”In the case of the official definition, someone has to be without work, available for work and searching for work or trying to start a business. The expanded definition does not require a person to be looking for a job – they just need to be without work and available for work.At the time the EFF released its manifesto on February 2, the latest available Quarterly Labour Force Survey was for thethird quarter of last year.According to the report and based on theofficial definition of unemployment,6.2 million peoplewere unemployed at that time.This means that they:Were between the ages of 15 and 64;Were not employed in the week before the survey interview; andActively looked for work or tried to start a business in the four weeks before the interview, and would have been able to start work or a business in the week before the interview.A person was also considered unemployed if they “had not actively looked for work in the past four weeks, but had a job or business to start at a definite date in the future and were available”.A further2.7 millionwere identified asdiscouraged work seekers. This group of people wanted to work, but did not try to find work because of a lack of jobs in their area, because they had lost hope or could not find work requiring their skills.An additional 817,000 people without work provided reasons for failing to search for a job other than the ones contained in the definition of a discouraged work seeker. These included ill health, a disability, pregnancy, childcare duties and a lack of transport, said Mosiane.Capability not part of either definitionThe unemployed, discouraged work seekers and those with other reasons for not searching for a job make up the expanded definition of unemployment. According to this definition, close to 9.8 million people, or37.3%, of the labour force (26.1 million) were unemployed in the third quarter of last year.While Mosiane noted that the EFF’s claim used the term “capable”, which was not part of the official or the expanded definition of unemployment, the numbers in the claim most closely match the expanded definition.Academicshave arguedthat there is little to distinguish between the two definitions in South Africa. Stats SApreviously toldAfrica Check that the expanded definition is a more stable indicator.EFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe confirmed to Africa Check that the party had applied the expanded definition in this case.Verdict: CorrectThe EFF’s claim that more than 9 million – or close to 40% – of South Africans who need jobs are unemployed is correct. Almost 9.8 million people – or 37.7% of the labour force – were unemployed according to the expanded definition of unemployment in the third quarter of last year.Claim ”The post-1994 governments have cumulatively bought less than 7% of the targeted 30% of land meant for redistribution over a period of 25 years.” Verdict incorrectIn 2012, then rural development and land reform minister Gugile Nkwinti used hisbudget vote speechto “clarify” government’s 30% target for land reform.Nkwinti said the target applied to white-owned agricultural land – close to a third of which government wanted to distribute to the historically disadvantaged by 2014.When the target was set in 1994, white-owned agricultural land was estimated to be82 million hectares, he said.The 30% came to 24.6 million hectares, which were earmarked for all three components of land reform, namely restitution, redistribution and tenure reform, according to the department of rural development and land reform.The department pointed out that it would be incorrect to still use the 30% target as it applied until 2014. The current target is to redistribute“20% of agricultural farming land by 2030”, in line with theNational Development Plan.We were unable to confirm with the department by the time of publication whether land previously redistributed would count towards the new target.How much land has the state bought?EFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe told us the party based its claim on a2016 report on land reformcommissioned by a high-level panel on the assessment of key legislation and the acceleration of fundamental change.The panel, chaired by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, was tasked with assessing the effectiveness of legislation that has come into effect since 1994. Land reform was one of the focus areas of the panel’s work.According to the report, authored by theInstitute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (Plaas)at the University of the Western Cape,“about 5 million hectares”were redistributed between 1994 and 2014/15. A further 3.2 million hectares were restored through restitution by 2014/15.This comes to 8.2 million hectares, or 6.7%, of the total land in South Africa (122 million hectares). The EFF told us this was how it reached the figure of “less than 7%”.Thelatest available data, according to the department, largely correspond with the data in the Plaas report. They show that the state has bought 4.9 million hectares for land redistribution since 1994, and a further 3.3 million hectares for restitution. Land acquired for tenure reform (782,487 hectares) was included in the 4.9 million hectares, said the department.It would therefore be correct to say that government has bought less than 7% of the total land in South Africa, but it is incorrect to say that the state has only bought 7% of the targeted 30%. The state has bought 8.2 million hectares – or 33% – of the targeted 24.6 million hectares.Not all of the land bought or transferred to beneficiaries for the purpose of land redistribution is necessarily commercial agricultural land. According to another commissioned high-level panel report, “some land acquired may be in urban areas or in communal areas, and may have been land acquired for non-agricultural purposes – before land reform became equated with agriculture. Nevertheless, we may presume that most may be considered land zoned for agriculture outside of the former Bantustans.”Redistribution, restitution and tenure reformThe EFF’s claim only mentions land acquired for redistribution, but land was also bought for restitution and tenure reform.The Plaas reportexplainsthe difference: “Soon after the first election in 1994, an ambitious policy of land reform began to be implemented. This included a land redistribution programme aimed at broadening access to land among the country’s black majority; a land restitution programme to restore land or provide alternative compensation to those dispossessed as a result of racially discriminatory laws and practices since 1913; and a tenure reform programme to secure the rights of people living under insecure arrangements on land owned by others, including the state (in communal areas and the former ‘coloured’ rural reserves) and private landowners (farm workers, farm dwellers and labour tenants).”The department confirmed that the amount of land bought for restitution excluded cases in which compensation was paid because land could not be restored or because beneficiaries chose to be compensated instead.Verdict: IncorrectThe claim that the government has bought less than 7% of the land initially meant for redistribution since 1994 is incorrect. Data show that it has bought a third – or 8.2 million hectares – of the land.Claim The EFF… “has a higher gender balance in parliament.” Verdict correctWomen and girls make up 51% of the country’s population, according to Statistics South Africa’s2018 mid-year population estimates.

            "[Evidences]:A video clip of Malcolm Roberts, a senator from Australia, talking about the COVID-19 pandemic is circulating on social media with text that appears to announce a big legal move. \"Nuremberg 2.0 crimes against humanity trial starts Jan 2023,\" the Oct. 23 Instagram post says. \"It’s become clear that people in this country and globally have been steamrolled,\" Roberts says in the clip. \"It is also clear that it has been coordinated globally. It is also clear that it has been integrated not just over six months, not just over 2.5 years, but it has been planned over decades. The changes to legislation in this country were done so that they could control doctors and people.\" Roberts also says \"the people that are guilty\" will be held accountable. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Nuremberg 2.0 is shorthand among conspiracy theorists for the criminal prosecution of world leaders for \"supposedly engineering a false pandemic,\" Vice has reported. It’s also a reference to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. As we’ve previously reported, the Nuremberg Code is a set of ethical rules for conducting human experiments created after World War II that includes the principle that humans should not be involuntarily subjected to medical experiments. It has been regularly cited in pandemic misinformation, including in debunked claims that COVID-19 vaccinations are a violation of the code. What’s more, contrary to Roberts’ claims in the video, the COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t fabricated. In 2020, efforts to downplay and deny its existence earned PolitiFact’s \"Lie of the Year.\" The video in the Instagram post shows an August event involving Roberts that was called \"The COVID Inquiry 2.0.\" Some speakers at the event were critical of the government’s pandemic restrictions and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. But it isn’t a sign that a crimes against humanity trial starts in January. We found no news reports, press releases or other sources to suggest a \"crimes against humanity trial\" is looming. The International Criminal Court investigates and tries individuals charged with crimes against humanity, among other offenses, and its prosecutor relies on the cooperation of countries around the world for support in making arrests and enforcing sentences.

            "claim [Claim]: Says Chris Christie fired 6,000 teachers.\n",
            "[Evidences]:New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie might have won re-election with plenty of votes from Democrats (a stunning third of voters from the other party marked their ballots for him, according to exit polls), but he got no love from a major Democratic constituency: teachers and people who identify with their cause. MSNBC host Ed Schultz puts himself in the teachers’ camp. On his election day show, Schultz said Christie is far more conservative than the moderate image that swirls around him. Case in point? The governor’s education policy. \"All of a sudden, he is the self-anointed expert on education in America, and he has all the answers,\" Schultz said. \"Cut a billion dollars out of the system, fire 6,000 teachers, and just tell everybody I'm an expert.\" Did Christie’s policy lead to the firing of 6,000 teachers? We decided to dig a little. We reached out the Ed Schultz Show and didn’t hear back, but the state count of teachers undercuts the claim. Christie took office in 2010. Over the next two years, the number of teachers fell by about 4,500. Year Number of teachers Change from year before 2007 110,964 2008 111,786 822 2009 114,450 2,664 2010 114,704 254 2011 110,301 -4,403 2012 110,229 -72 Source: New Jersey Education Dept. Now, while 4,500 is less than 6,000, it’s still a lot of teachers, and Schultz could claim that he was in the ballpark. Except we know that not all those teachers were fired. \" 'Firing' is an incorrect term,\" said Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association. Wollmer said Christie backed a budget cut of $1.3 billion for schools. It produced a mix of layoffs and retirements. Wollmer said layoffs were more common than retirements, but he said he has no hard data on how many people fell into each group. Plus, the cuts led to reductions in the ranks of both teachers and support staff. Wollmer lumps both groups together. \"I’m more than comfortable saying Christie was responsible for over 6,000 layoffs, due to his cuts,\" Wolmer said. But that raises another wrinkle in the story. We need to assess whether responsibility for the loss of teachers rest solely on Christie’s shoulders. Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker and now head of a left-leaning think tank, New Jersey Policy Perspective, said two things happened after Christie took office. \"Christie and the Democratic Legislature cut $1 billion in state funds from school aid and the stimulus aid expired,\" MacInnes said. A multi-billion dollar state budget deficit made 2010 a very contentious year for school funding. Christie proposed deep reductions in aid, and local school boards tried to fill the gap with property tax hikes. Then local voters shot down those plans in record numbers. Those local decisions complicate the picture, \"Yes, funding cuts do appear in many cases to have led to staffing reductions,\" said Bruce Baker, professor of education at Rutgers. \"But I'm not sure of a good data source you could use to identify what share of those reductions were from ‘reduction in force’ policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress.\" On the other hand, as a deadline loomed for passage of a state budget, Christie refused concessions to the Democratic-controlled Legislature and the state’s smallest budget in five years passed with a minimum of Democratic support. The initial cuts were so deep, a judge reversed a portion of them. The loss of stimulus dollars also played a major role. According to the federal government website, Recovery.gov, New Jersey received over $1.6 billion in one-time education grants through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. In April 2010, Christie’s administration said schools needed to manage a slightly smaller loss of about $1 billion in stimulus funds but in either case, schools were losing a significant amount of money due to the end of the federal program. Overall, Christie gets a fair degree of responsibility for the school funding cuts, although the way those cuts translated into reductions in staff might be indirect. Our ruling Schultz said Christie firied 6,000 teachers. There are two problems with Schultz’s claim. First, the number is closer to 4,500, and even the teachers’ union would not say that all the people that held those jobs were fired. Some of them retired and were not replaced. The number of teachers declined but not necessarily through being fired or laid-off. Second, while Christie pushed hard for steep cuts to school funding, he also got help from local voters. Because of those caveats, we rate Schultz's claim Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: In September 2018, Dana Loesch hosted an NRA television segment that showed Thomas the Tank Engine characters wearing digitally-added Ku Klux Klan hoods.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In September 2018, NRATV (the National Rifle Association’s television channel) caused controversy when they digitally added Ku Klux Klan hoods to trains from the long-running children’s television program Thomas and Friends during a segment about gender and racial diversity. The segment in question was aired on 7 September 2018, during NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch’s show “Relentless.” The episode is no longer available, though clips are included in the following video: Loesch was addressing a recent development on Thomas and Friends which saw two female characters (one of them from Africa) added to the show to bolster its international appeal and give more prominence to female characters: Announcing a new direction for the Thomas and Friends TV show, Mattel said that several changes to the 30-year-old show would help to update the brand’s image and popularity, particularly in Africa and Asia, where the characters and stories were hugely popular. Changes include some new female characters, including Nia, a train engine from Kenya, and Rebecca, a strong-willed, outspoken electric locomotive. Other female characters include an aeroplane from Australia and an Indian train yard controller. The changes are all an effort to modernise the Thomas brand and give it a distinctive international flavour. “We have added new female characters before, but I think, with a show like Thomas, they tend to fall into the background after initial introduction,” said Thomas and Friends producer Ian McCue. “What we wanted to do here was really bring these two female characters to the forefront.” Another of the show’s producers, Micaela Winter, said gender equality was important to the creators in the new series and going forward. Here are the relevant excerpts from Loesch’s monologue on the subject, along with the imagery shown on screen along the way: Anyway, [the producers of Thomas and Friends] have decided that the next stop is “virtue town.” Thomas the Tank is now bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains. Seriously. One of those trains, Nia, will be from Kenya to add ethnic diversity to the show. By the way, that’s where it gets really strange to me because I’ve looked at Thomas and Friends, at their pictures, and they seem grey and blue. Am I to understand this entire time that Thomas and his trains were white? Because they all had grey faces. How do you bring ethnic diversity? I mean they had to paint what I guess they thought was some kind of African pattern on the side of Nia’s engine? I mean, how do you bring ethnic diversity to a show that literally has no ethnicities, because they’re trains! They don’t even have skin pigmentation! Was there some concern that the show had racist undertones? Because, I mean, Sir Topham Hatt clearly is white, but the trains? I’m looking at this picture, and I’m really really struggling to understand how in the world there isn’t any diversity in any of this … [Reacting to Ku Klux Klan hoods on screen] Oh. Was it because? I see it. It was the white hoods and the burning train tracks. Ok fine, fair point, I get it. Thomas the Tank Engine has been a blight on race relations for far too long. Clearly, this is overdue, right? So the segment was structured as a joke: Loesch expressed outrage and bafflement about the introduction of female characters, including one from Kenya, then questioned whether the producers of Thomas and Friends were compensating for some previous racism on the show. The fake “Ku Klux Klan” image provided a punchline of sorts, with Loesch then theatrically “accepting” that there was, in fact, a need for greater diversity on the show. Loesch made some notable omissions and errors in her monologue. First, although she claimed that the show’s producers were “bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains,” Thomas and Friends (and its spin-offs) have featured female characters (including trains) for many years. Some of those characters, including Gina and Frieda, were introduced in the 2016 film The Great Race, but others have been a part of the Thomas universe for much longer. Emily first appeared on the show in 2003, and Annie and Clarabelle (a pair of passenger coaches) were in the original 1946 book Thomas the Tank Engine and the subsequent television series. Second, Loesch failed to mention that the new initiative was part of a collaboration between the United Nations and Mattel, the toy company that own sthe Thomas the Tank Engine brand, to promote five of the U.N.’s 17 “Sustainable Development Goals”: In a press release, Mattel said that newest season of the show would see the characters travel beyond the fictional world of Sodor, to locations in China, India and Australia, and would see the introduction of several new (mostly female) characters from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and nationalities: The series will feature characters from around the world, including the new African steam engine from Kenya called Nia, Ashima from India, Yong Bao from China, and Shane from Australia, as well as host of new female characters … including Isla, an Aussie flying doctor plane, Noor Jehan, a royal express engine from India, and Hong-Mei, a Number 1 Blue Tank Engine from China. In response to NRATV’s “Ku Klux Klan” segment, Mattel issued a statement saying that “We are not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company.”\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee questioned the motives and origins of \"so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ \" during the Nov. 10 undercard GOP debate. While Huckabee, a former pastor, says he’s concerned about the plight of Christians in the region, he dismissed the idea of the United States accepting whoever —as he put it —wants free sandwiches and health care. \"We have no idea who these people are. What we do know is only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian,\" Huckabee said. \"Are we going to open the door so ISIS people can come on in, and we’ll give them a place to stay and a good sandwich and medical benefits?\" We were curious about Huckabee’s claim that the majority of the refugees don’t come from Syria. Huckabee’s spokesperson Hogan Gidley told us his source was the Eurostat, the European Union’s official statistical agency. He also forwarded us an article in the Daily Mail that said \"four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria.\" (The article’s findings were repeated by some conservative American media outlets.) We found that the Daily Mail’s and Huckabee’s statistic represents the situation in the three months before the Syrian migrants actually began arriving in Europe in bulk. Looking at the whole picture, asylum seekers from Syria represent half of all refugees. According to the Daily Mail, the European Union \"logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war.\" Those figures are lifted from Eurostat’s latest asylum quarterly report. But the Daily Mail’s use of data is flawed, and Huckabee’s extrapolation even more so. First, the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian as Huckabee’s phrasing — \"so-called Syrian refugees\" — suggests. There is anecdotal evidence of people using fake or stolen passports, but the refugees in Eurostat’s tally hail from other countries that are experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq and Kosovo. The Guardianexplains why this distorts the refugee situation: \"If you lump this group in with those who crossed the Mediterranean to claim asylum, the number of Syrians will naturally seem smaller. But this is to conflate two largely separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states.\" (Huckabee’s point was that media reports conflated the the Syrian refugees and those who were not, Gidley told us.) And last and most importantly, the 44,000 figure only represents a three-month period. This is \"particularly problematic\" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, pointed out the Guardian. Here’s a chart with data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Syria page to that point: If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively. Our ruling Huckabee said, \"Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian.\" While the claim isn’t pulled out of thin air, it’s flawed. The statistic represents the three months before the actual influx of Syrian refugees, and the four out of five non-Syrians are not purporting to be Syrian. Rather, they came from war-torn countries. Overall, Syrian refugees account for half of all refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 so far. We rate Huckabee’s claim Mostly False.\n",

Not really Recently, scientists have warned of the rapid melting of Antarctica's Thwaites glacier - also known as \"Doomsday glacier\" for its collapse could submerge many coastal cities worldwide. Amid this, a purported view of Antarctica from space is being widely shared on social media. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. This is actually a computer-generated image of the Earth with full view of the Antarctic region. The post is viral on Facebook and Twitter. The archived version can be seen here. AFWA probe We found that this picture was not taken from space. Rather, it is a computer-generated image showing the Antarctic region. We got the initial hint about this from the comment section of the post where some people questioned its authenticity. A user had commented that it was an artist's rendering, and not an actual photograph. We then conducted a reverse image search. This led us to a Pinterest post with the title \"Antarctica Visualization Wallpaper\". With the help of keyword search, we found this image was created by NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio. The\"Scientific Visualization Studio\" works with NASA's scientists to create visualisations, animations and images. Its purpose is to promote a better understanding of the Earth and space research activities at NASA. We found that in 2007, on the occasion of International Polar Year, the \"Scientific Visualization Studio\" had released some visualizations of the space view of Arctic and Antarctic on September 21, 2005. These visualizations were created by data visualiser Cindy Starr. Last year, the same picture went viral with the claim that it is part of the first photos taken by the ISRO's lunar mission Chandrayaan-2. At that time too, several websites had debunked it. Therefore, we can say that the viral picture is not of Antarctica as seen from space, but a computer-generated image created by NASA's \"Scientific Visualization Studio\".

            "[Evidences]:We've seen and been asked about a video in which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab appears to say that Covid tests false positive rate is 93%. In the video from September, Mr Raab is asked why there is not testing at airports currently. He responds: \"The challenge is that the false positive rate is very high so only 7% of tests will be successful in identifying those that actually have the virus. So the truth is that you can't only rely on that.\" The false positive rate means the percentage of tests that wrongly tell people who do not have the virus that they are infected. Tests can also produce false negatives, where people who do have the virus are told they don't. It appears Mr Raab was referencing a PHE report, which stated that the success rate of identifying Covid cases when only testing travellers on arrival at airports is 7%. By testing on arrival and then testing again five days into self isolation, the success rate goes up to 88%. Mr Raab appears to have mis-spoken, as the PHE report doesn't talk about false positives at all. It's actually referring to false negative results: incoming travellers who are infected, but who might not be identified by a single test at an airport. This can be due to factors such as the virus's incubation period, when an infected person might still test negative due to the low levels of virus in their body. In addition, the PHE study is not based on real-life data. It is simply a modelling study intended to explore how different isolation and testing regimes might improve the chances of identifying infected travellers. Like all models, it simplifies things and makes some assumptions that may not reflect reality . It's not possible to establish a definitive false positive rate for Covid-19 testing, as this can vary according to circumstance, but as we have written elsewhere there is good evidence that false positives are extremely rare with the RT-PCR tests that are used for most testing in the UK.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A new technology touted as having the ability to harvest energy from the night sky may some day bridge gaps left by solar energy. Comedian @TheLewisBlack once joked the problem with solar energy is the sun disappears at night. Answering the call, scientists have now come up with anti-solar panels that actually don't need the sun. #GreenEnergy #solarenergy @SolarEnergyNews https://t.co/bXSKaZS9pY — The Debrief (@Debriefmedia) February 26, 2021 That’s according to researchers at the University of California Davis who designed so-called “anti-solar panels” and described them in a 2020 concept in the peer-reviewed scientific journal ACS Photonics. The idea took steam again on the internet on Feb. 20, 2021, when British internet media company Unilad published an article describing the “anti-solar panels” that could “generate power at night.” Traditional solar panels are made up of small photovoltaic, or solar, cells. These electrical components generate electricity through the absorption of light. By taking this technology and flipping it, the researchers said the potential exists to generate about 50 watts of power per square meter — about a quarter of that generated by a conventional solar panel in the daytime. Ultimately, small photovoltaic cells in a solar panel deliver power because the radiation source, the sun, is very hot and the solar cell, in comparison, is cool. The solar panel thus attracts energy from the sun to convert it into electrical power. But photovoltaics can only generate electricity during daylight hours. So, how can solar technology be deployed to produce electrical power after the sun has set? It’s a new field known as radiative cooling, and the technology was described in a concept paper, so it’s important to note that it is theoretical in nature. But under this theory, an object that is hot compared to its surroundings will radiate heat as infrared light. The sun is hot, so heat from it radiates to a conventional solar cell on Earth, which is cooler in comparison. Thermoradiative photovoltaics uses this same concept to traditionally absorb heat from surrounding hot objects, like a generator’s cooling tower or an engine’s exhaust pipe, and convert it into energy. But the theory proposed by UC Davis researchers turns thermoradiative panels on Earth into these so-called hot objects and quite literally points them at a cold object, for example, the night sky. Space is cold, so a warm object pointed at the night sky will radiate heat toward it to convert heat into electricity through photons, or light cells. “A regular solar cell generates power by absorbing sunlight, which causes a voltage to appear across the device and for current to flow. In these new devices, light is instead emitted and the current and voltage go in the opposite direction, but you still generate power,” said lead researcher Jeremy Munday in a university news release at the time. “You have to use different materials, but the physics is the same.” Humans have been using similar technologies for thousands of years in design choices for their structures. For example, indigenous communities in the Southwest have created adobe homes that slowly warm up during the day and give off heat at night to regulate the interior heat. In more modern times, white paint is used to coat the roofs of buildings to reflect sunlight and reduce heat during the day. And though the actual device has not yet been developed, researchers concluded that generating carbon-neutral power at night will help in the global push for carbon neutrality, paving way for new technologies that can produce clean energy around the clock.\n",

Newschecker received the claim on our WhatsApp tipline (+91 9999499044) to be fact-checked. We also found several such posts on social media. #BREAKING #Omicron This from a Dr. friend who was on a call w/ Edward Ryan MD Director of International Infectious Disease- Massachusetts General Hospital Read full thread 1 Close to 100% of the positive cases in MA are Omicron.

This has been circulating widely and there are questions and concerns that it may contain misinformation downplaying the severity of COVID and Omicron. pic.twitter.com/PyiG5uPpIc — Jae Minard (@jaeminard) January 10, 2022 Fact Check/Verification To check the authenticity of the claim, Newschecker conducted a keyword search using the words Dr Edward Ryan and ‘talk on Omicron’ on Google and found a Reddit thread, where users had posted the same content of the message, word-to-word, wondering if it was true. These messages have been posted by those predominantly in the United States and do not attribute the content to Kiran Mazumdar Shaw. On further research, we also found the same post on a Chinese website, confirming that the message was viral in other countries before it reached India. Newschecker also came upon a press release issued by the Massachusetts General Hospital that revealed the message lacked context. “We are aware of COVID-19 information circulating online evidently reflecting an individual’s personal notes from listening to a talk by Edward Ryan, MD, director of Global Infectious Diseases at MGH. These notes lack context, details, and nuance. For instance, the role that vaccines play in mitigating severe disease or death was not included, and individuals with comorbid conditions should continue to take extra precautions to minimize contracting COVID irrelevant of age,” the statement by the hospital read. The statement, however, did not give more details on the talk. Newschecker also contacted Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, who confirmed that she was not the one who took the alleged notes. “I did not take these notes. I just received the message on WhatsApp and I forwarded the message. People are assuming that I took these notes, which is not true,” Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said.

            "claim [Claim]: Deaths after Covid-19 vaccines have overtaken the number of Covid-19 deaths in \"healthy\" people that occurred in 2020.\n",
            "[Evidences]:An article on the website TCW , formerly known as Conservative Woman , warns against teenagers receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, citing claims that vaccine deaths have overtaken the number of Covid-19 deaths in \"healthy\" people during the whole of 2020. The conclusions drawn in the article make false comparisons between different sets of data, at points directly against the advice of health authorities, and follow a number of articles that make similarly false claims , which we have fact checked before . The article also falsely claims that an increasing proportion of people will die as the Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out to younger people. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in Vaccine deaths have not overtaken Covid-19 deaths As we have written many times before, deaths after vaccination reported through the Yellow Card scheme are not proven to have been caused by the vaccine. The Conservative Woman article bases its claim that vaccine deaths have overtaken Covid-19 deaths on two mismatched sets of data—the total number of deaths reported after vaccination through the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme , and the number of fatalities 'due to' or 'involving' Covid in people aged under 65 with no underlying health conditions for the whole of 2020. The article doesn't link to the source of this second figure, but Full Fact found the figure it cites in a Freedom of Information request published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) . It's impossible to accurately compare the number of Covid-19 deaths and deaths reported after a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as they are counted completely differently. The Yellow Card scheme relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public, and is intended to provide an early warning of any previously unknown risks from medicines or medical devices. However, it is important to note that side effects reported as occurring after the vaccine were not necessarily caused by the vaccine. In its analysis of deaths reported after the vaccine , the MHRA states: \"Vaccination and surveillance of large populations means that, by chance, some people will experience and report a new illness or events in the days and weeks after vaccination. \"A high proportion of people vaccinated early in the vaccination campaign were very elderly, and/or had pre-existing medical conditions. Older age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions of people vaccinated. \"It is therefore important that we carefully review these reports to distinguish possible side effects from illness that would have occurred irrespective of vaccination.\" There is a possible link between the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and a rare form of blood clot with low platelet count, which can be fatal. On 7 April 2021, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised that , for adults aged under 30 without underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe Covid-19, an alternative vaccine such as Pfixer/BioNTech or Moderna should be given where available . Even if these figures were possible to compare, such a comparison would be misleading because they do not cover the same time period. The Yellow Card data covers the entire vaccination rollout in the UK, from 9 December 2020 to present (with a slight lag) and is updated weekly. Meanwhile, the deaths data the article uses only covers 2020 , missing the tens-of-thousands of deaths that have occurred so far during 2021. The figures are also geographically mismatched. The ONS only covers England and Wales in its numbers , while the Yellow Card data covers the entire UK. It's also important to point out that the article is focused on Covid-19 deaths where the people who died had no underlying conditions. As we have written before , this is a misleading way of interpreting the data. \"Underlying conditions\" covers a broad range of health conditions, such as asthma, kidney disease and dementia, and doesn't indicate whether or not Covid-19 was the leading cause of death. No evidence more young people will die from the Covid-19 vaccine than the virus itself Central to the article is the claim that an increasing proportion of people will die from the vaccine rather than Covid-19, as the rollout reaches younger members of the population. TCW claims that up to 21 March 2021, there were 36 Covid deaths in the whole of the UK in the 0-19 age group, it then says 91.1% of these had at least one known comorbidity—meaning they had at least one other underlying medical condition. The article does not link to the source of this information. Of these deaths, it says 20 were of young people in England and Wales. This does not align with data we have from NHS England , which states that up to 24 March 2021, 39 people aged 0-19 died of Covid-19 in hospitals in England alone. Nine of these people did not have any pre-existing conditions. It's not clear how the TCW article calculates another claim it makes: that there is a \"one in 46,911 [chance] of dying 'shortly after vaccination' following the AstraZeneca jab\" or a \"one in 73,045 chance of dying following the Pfizer jab\". The closest to this number we could calculate is by looking at the approximate number of vaccines, by brand, administered in the UK, which is outlined in the weekly Yellow Card reports . For example, if you simply divide the 21.3 million first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by the 508 UK reports of suspected adverse reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in which the patient died shortly after vaccination, you reach 41,929. However, as explained above, this totally ignores the fact that there is no proven link between these deaths and the vaccine. As we stated earlier, the vaccine rollout was first concentrated in the oldest and most vulnerable members of society, a proportion of whom were sadly more likely to die irrespective of receiving the vaccine. It's impossible to extrapolate this number to younger, healthier members of the population, as the TCW article attempts to do, simply because they can be expected to live far longer. As the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication set out in April , when the possible connection between the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines and rare blood clots was announced, there are some scenarios in which the immediate potential harms of the AstraZeneca vaccine could outweigh the benefits in people who were at a low risk of exposure to the virus, particularly in younger age groups. However, this communication of risk did not look at the potential benefits and harms for teenagers, nor the long term benefits of vaccination and only reflects the situation for one vaccine in April 2021. The end of the TCW article points parents who are considering whether or not to consent to their children being vaccinated to the Oxford University vaccination risk calculator. The tool gives users a risk score produced by an evidence-based mode l which uses a range of factors such as age, sex, ethnicity and existing medical conditions to predict risk of death or hospitalisation from Covid-19. The online tool, however, explicitly warns against the calculator being used \"for supporting or informing clinical decision-making\", stating that \"it is ONLY to be used for academic research, peer review and validation purposes, and it must NOT be used with data or information relating to any individual\". It is also only designed to be used for people aged between 19 and 100 , excluding most teenagers.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Fox News reported in 2021 that former President Donald Trump had \"vowed to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell\" if he is elected again in 2024.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In late 2021 and early 2022, critics of former U.S. President Donald Trump, primarily left-leaning, enthusiastically shared a social media post which appeared to add some credibility to long-standing rumors about him. On Dec. 29, a jury in New York convicted English socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of assisting her longtime companion, the disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, in procuring underage girls to be sexually abused, over a period of many years. Epstein died in prison in August 2019, while facing sex trafficking charges, in what the New York City medical examiner determined was a suicide. Like other influential and well-connected politicians and businessmen, Trump knew and socialized with both Epstein and Maxwell, and he has long been the subject of so-far unsubstantiated rumors of sexual impropriety involving young women and even girls. Against that background, @USAlight3, a Twitter account that regularly posts left-wing, anti-Trump content, wrote on Dec. 30: “FOX NEWS: Trump vowed to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell if he wins in 2024.” The claim was that Fox News reported that Trump had said he would pardon Maxwell if he were elected as president again in 2024. In reality, Fox News had reported no such thing. Back in the summer of 2021, several outlets wrote about a snippet from Michael Wolff’s book “Landslide” which alleged, based on unnamed sources, that Trump had mentioned Maxwell in the context of conversations about his presidential pardon power, before he left office in January 2021. Notably, Trump did not actually pardon Maxwell, even though the charges against her were well known by that time. We are issuing a rating of “Mostly False.” By logical necessity, any “vow” by Trump to pardon Maxwell if he won election in 2024 would have to have taken place after President Joe Biden’s election win in November 2020 (otherwise, Trump would have framed his intention in terms of a second term). We could find no such report on the website of Fox News during the period since Biden’s victory. Nor did we find any similar reports from any other reputable news source. So the “2024” claim, in particular, was baseless. However, although unproven, the broader allegation that Trump has held an interest in pardoning Maxwell was at least based on some external source, namely Michael Wolff’s 2021 book “Landslide.” In it, Wolff describes the chaotic final days and weeks of Trump’s presidency, and in one section, writes about Trump’s approach to issuing pardons, as follows: Bored by the process and the details, Trump nevertheless, in the last week, would trawl for candidates, with sudden spurts of determination not to leave this power unused. “Who do you think should be pardoned? Give me one person—who’s your top pick?” became a frequent conversational interruption. One “Oh, shit” moment involved his sudden interest in Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein now facing years in prison over allegations of her role in the Epstein sex-abuse scandal. Trump had tried hard to downplay his own long relationship with Epstein “Has she said anything about me?” He openly wondered. “Is she going to talk? Will she roll on anybody?” But pardon talk almost immediately segued to the question of if he should pardon himself: “They say I can. Unlimited pardon power.” Wolff’s putative sources are unnamed, so we cannot even begin to test the accuracy of that description. However, one thing we do know for certain is that Trump did not actually pardon Maxwell of anything while he was president, despite having the power and opportunity to do so.

            "[Evidences]:Leticia Van de Putte says that thankfully, few Texans stand to benefit from her proposed tax break for surviving spouses of Texans who die in action.The San Antonio Democrat, who chairs the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, told colleagues on the Senate floor May 1, 2013: \"According to Department of Defense data, there would only be about 250 killed in action, who were Texans, since 9/11.\"Michael Brick, an Associated Press reporter based in Austin, brought her claim to our attention via Twitter, wondering if that tally was low.It was, according to a table of figures emailed to us by Van de Putte spokesman Lee Nichols. The table indicates 588 Texans were killed in action from Oct. 1, 2011, to Jan. 24, 2013. It was prepared by the Defense Manpower Data Center, which is the Department of Defense’s \"human resource information source.\"Some 310 of the Texans were married when they died, the table indicates, while 253 were not married; 24 were divorced; and one had an unknown marital status.By email, Nichols noted that Van de Putte generally focused in her remarks on Texas members of the armed services killed in action with surviving spouses in the state who might benefit from her proposed constitutional amendment, which cleared the Senate and awaits House consideration. Under the proposal, which also would require voter approval to take effect, spouses who have not remarried could be exempt from paying property taxes on their homesteads.Shortly after declaring the 250 figure, Nichols stressed, Van de Putte clarified by saying: \"So we’re talking probably about 250 folks who would even qualify for this, and that’s since 9/11.\"Nichols said Van de Putte gave the incorrect figure due to staff error. By telephone, Bill Wilson, chief of staff for the Senate committee, told us that as Van de Putte spoke, he gave her the 250 figure by drawing from the wrong column on the table. His intent, he said, was to let her know that 310 of the Texans killed in action since 9/11 were married, which is of relevance to the fiscal impact of her proposal.Finally, Defense Department spokeswoman Leslie Hull-Ryde guided us to up-to-date online counts of Americans killed in action, enabling us to confirm that as of May 2, 2013, 588 Texans had been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011. Those Texans comprised 11 percent of the 5,258 Americans killed in action since 9/11, according to the government figures.Precisely, the government counts indicate, 411 Texans were killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom (which ran through August 2010); 170 in Operation Enduring Freedom (occurring in Afghanistan and other countries); and seven in Operation New Dawn (in Iraq and nearby countries since Sept. 1, 2010)--with all but 11 of the dead being men. According to the information, the deaths occurred from Jan. 4, 2002, through Dec. 24, 2012. We calculated the average age of the victims as 26. (See our breakout, including individual names and other details, here.)Brick, the AP reporter, responded to Nichols’ email on this topic by tweeting a May 2, 2013, update, followed by a confessional tweet: \"Related: This reporter once spent weeks gathering string on a story,\" as in detail, \"then spelled Sen. VDP's name wrong, so nobody's perfect.\"Our rulingVan de Putte said about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11.That’s off by more than half; 588 Texans perished in action from January 2002 through the most recent Texan's death on Dec. 24, 2012, according to the federal government.The senator likely drew her number from the wrong column on a table. Regardless, what she said rates as False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:IN SHORT : Elizabeth can be seen in the black and white photo wearing a hat and gloves and holding a handbag. Below her, men pan diamonds from a pool of water at the bottom of a deep pit. In a black and white photo posted on Facebook in September 2022, labourers work in a pool of water at the bottom of a deep terraced pit. At the top of the pit, a group of well-dressed people stand behind a railing, looking down on the labourers. \"Queen Elizabeth II (above,wearing gloves) watches work in progress during a visit to the alluvial diamond working site at Hangha in Kenema, Sierra Leone in 1961,\" the photo's caption begins. The United Kingdom 's queen Elizabeth II died on 8 September, aged 96, after 70 years on the throne. She was crowned queen in 1952. Alluvial diamonds are found in and around rivers and shorelines, having been washed out of the kimberlite rock they were formed in. Sierra Leone is a small country – about the size of Ireland – on the West African coast. It was the first of what would eventually be the United Kingdom's many African colonies . \"In 1930 diamond was discovered in Sierra Leone,\" the photo's caption continues. \"Also the country was among the top-ten diamond-producing nations in the world. Unfortunately, Sierra Leone benefitted nothing from Diamond but war which lasted for 11 years.\" Since Elizabeth's death, as with many headline-grabbing events, false information about her has been circulating online. And Meta's fact-checking system has flagged the post as possibly false. Meta is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Does the photo really show Elizabeth II watching diamond miners at work in Sierra Leone in 1961? Snapped by British photojournalist Terry Fincher A TinEye reverse image search of the photo reveals that the post is correct. The photo is part of the collections of the reputable stock image sites Alamy and Getty Images . Both sites give the photo the same caption : \"Queen Elizabeth watches work in progress during a visit to the alluvial diamond workings at Hangha in Kenema, an eastern province of Sierra Leone, 1st December 1961.\" Getty credits the photo to British photojournalist Terry Fincher , who died in 2008. In a higher resolution version of the photo on the Getty site, Elizabeth can be seen at the right of the people standing at the top of the pit. She wears a white hat and gloves, and is holding a handbag. A not-quite-post-colonial tour of West Africa In late 1961 , Elizabeth II visited Ghana , Sierra Leone and the Gambia in a month-long tour of West Africa. Ghana had gained independence from British colonialism in 1957 . In 1961, the Gambia was still a British colony . Sierra Leone was in a between stage . In 1961 it no longer had British colonial status , but remained a dominion of the crown with Elizabeth its queen and head of state. The country would only become a republic 10 years later, in 1971. That was more than 200 years after Britain, in 1748 , seized an island named Bunce . Bunce island lies in a river north of Freetown , today Sierra Leone's capital. It was a centre of the trade in enslaved people from West Africa to the Americas. The island's importance to the history of the transatlantic slave trade has put it on the World Monuments list and given it tentative status as a Unesco World Heritage Site. The language spoken by the Gullah community in the southeastern US states of Georgia and South Carolina traces their ancestry directly back to enslaved people taken from Sierra Leone. Colonisation of Sierra Leone progressed in stages, until it was officially declared a crown colony in 1808 . Diamonds in Sierra Leone Diamonds were discovered in Sierra Leone in 1930. In 1935, the British colonial authorities gave the De Beers Sierra Leone Selection Trust exclusive mining and prospecting rights over the entire country for 99 years. By 1937 , Sierra Leone was producing a million carats of diamonds every year. One carat is 0.2 grams of diamond, so De Beers was able to take 200 kilograms of diamonds from this one small colony every year. But because Sierra Leone diamonds are alluvial and so easily mined – they don't have to be dug out of rock deep in the earth – the country also has a long history of small-scale illegal diamond mining. By 1956 there were some 75,000 illicit miners operating outside of the De Beers monopoly. According to one account , this led to \"smuggling on a vast scale\" and a \"general breakdown of law and order\". After independence from Britain, conflict over diamonds continued. In 1991 civil war broke out. The war raged for more than a decade, and saw \"intense violence against civilians, recruitment of child soldiers, corruption and bloody struggle for control of diamond mines,\" says the International Center for Transitional Justice . The human cost of diamond conflict in Sierra Leone has even reached Western popular culture, in Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio's 2006 movie Blood Diamond . Small-scale or artisanal diamond mining in Sierra Leone continues today . In 2020, De Beers launched its \"innovative GemFair programme designed to help formalise the artisanal and small-scale (ASM) diamond mining sector\". The programme would reportedly cover 100 small mines. But it remains a fact that, as one headline puts it , the \"wealth from Sierra Leone's diamonds\" has failed to enrich local communities. Sierra Leone ranks at 181 out of 191 countries in the 2021/22 Human Development Index , with a score of 0.477. The United Kingdom, by contrast, ranks at 18 out of 191 , with a score of 0.929. The index is put together by the United Nations Development Programme . It assesses progress in \"three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living\".\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says President Barack Obama \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt in his first term, more than the $6.3 trillion added by the previous 43 presidents combined.\n",
            "[Evidences]:UPDATE: A more recent version of a similar claim is available here. When it comes to increasing the national debt, President Barack Obama has done more than his 43 predecessors combined.Well, at least that’s according to a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey, echoing a claim made to varying degrees by different Republican officials in recent years. With the subject line \"A picture is worth 1,000 words,\" the chain e-mail features a graphic to make its case.Above pictures of Presidents George Washington and George W. Bush, one side of the graphic reads \"Debt Added By The Previous 43 U.S. PRESIDENTS COMBINED --- 1789 through 2008.\" Beneath the presidents’ photos is \"$6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS.\"On the other side of the graphic is a photo of a smiling Obama, beneath the words \"Debt Added By PRESIDENT OBAMA --- One Term!\" The amount listed below the photo is \"$6.5 TRILLION DOLLARS.\"A picture may be worth 1,000 words, but the wording of this chain e-mail makes for a largely inaccurate claim.The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet.First, let’s explain the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public -- as accrued by Obama’s predecessors -- stood at roughly $6.307 trillion and the total debt was about $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator. Since the amount listed for Obama's predecessors in the chain e-mail appears to be in reference to the $6.307 trillion in debt held by the public on Jan. 20, 2009, that's the starting point for our analysis. Next, we'll show how much both forms of debt had increased as of April 27, 2012 -- the last date available at the time we received the chain e-mail.By that date, the debt held by the public was about $10.8 trillion and total debt had climbed to roughly $15.6 trillion.So, under Obama’s watch, debt held by the public had increased by about $4.5 trillion, or roughly 72 percent. Total debt had increased by nearly $5 trillion, or about 47 percent.By either form of debt, the amounts added during Obama’s administration were not greater than the levels on the day he took office.Now, let’s explain one way that this chain e-mail could be considered accurate.If we take into account administration projections for debt held by the public as of the end of fiscal year 2013, then the amount of that debt added would exceed the level from Jan. 20, 2009. Fiscal year 2013 is the last budget year to begin during Obama’s first term.According to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, debt held by the public is estimated to be about $12.636 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2013, which concludes Sept. 30, 2013.Based on that estimate, the amount of debt held by the public that was added during Obama’s tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion.In terms of total debt -- projected to increase to $17.5 trillion -- the amount added by the end of fiscal year 2013 would still not exceed the total amount on Jan. 20, 2009. Before we get to our ruling, it's worth noting that actions taken by both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade. Those factors include tax cuts enacted under Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which were started by the Bush administration, as well as the stimulus bill and another tax cut deal approved by Obama. Experts also have pointed to the weak economy as a contributing factor to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.Our rulingA chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims that Obama has \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt, while his 43 predecessors added $6.3 trillion combined.But the chain e-mail is wrong to suggest the additional debt during Obama’s tenure already has exceeded the level of his predecessors. In terms of both debt held by the public and total debt, the Obama administration has added less debt than the amounts in place when he took office.Still, the national debt is projected to keep increasing. The amount of added debt held by the public may exceed Obama’s predecessors by October 2013, according to White House projections.We rate the statement Mostly False.

            "claim [Claim]: \"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. (With Eric Cantor's defeat), they are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Dave Brat’s surprise primary win over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor didn’t just knock out a potential successor to Speaker John Boehner. Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP’s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO’s Real Time. \"Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact,\" Maher said June 13. \"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party.\" Does Cantor’s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian? Republicans ‘all Christian’ The 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii’s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as \"none\" (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the religious affiliation of members for a 2012 report. They joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat). When it comes to Republicans, 192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic. The only possible hang-up to Maher’s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism. Some Christians do not recognize Mormons, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians. Mormonsdo consider themselves Christians. Republicans ‘all white’ Maher also said the GOP’s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That’s Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013. To say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of \"all white,\" which isn’t always so easy to define. There are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats). There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats). But there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the Congressional Research Service. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the categories white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguisticsimilarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all. Pew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected \"some other race\" in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor. \"To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent,\" Dougherty said. \"It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress.\" It’s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher’s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. The timeline of all this One more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are \"now\" all white and all Christian, that’s not accurate -- Cantor isn’t going anywhere yet. The GOP’s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections. And as he leaves office, it’s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress. There are several possibilities: Mia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, is afar-and-awayfavorite to win a seat in the U.S. House come November. Will Hurd, an African-American Republican, secured the GOP nomination in Texas’ most-competitive House district (which backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012). T.W. Shannon, an African-American Republican, has the support of Texas’ Cruz in Shannon’s bid for an Oklahoma Senate seat. (His primary is June 24.) A Jewish Republican and state lawmaker, Adam Kwasman, is running in the Republican primary in Arizona’s 1st Congressional District. Our ruling Without Cantor, Maher said, the GOP in Congress is \"now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed.\" Maher’s show did not respond to a request for comment. If we learned anything from this fact-check, it is that straightforward sounding claims about religion and race are rarely that straightforward. Still, Maher’s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP’s ranks. On religion, Maher's claim comes down to how you view Mormonism. On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white,Hispanic or something else. Also, Cantor isn’t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It’s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves. Maher’s statement is partially accurarebut leaves out important details. We rate itHalf True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says 25 percent of Austin's public school buildings are \"underutilized.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Speaking to an Austin school task force’s exploration of possible Austin school closures, the volunteer group’s co-chair recently applauded alternative ideas yet warned that campus shutdowns aren’t off the table.Janet Mitchell told the Austin American-Statesman for a Jan. 20 news article: \"The reality is that the (Austin school) district has a long-term inefficiency in utilization of school buildings. We have 25 percent of our school buildings that are underutilized. At some point... the community is going to need to decide whether we continue to invest in under-enrolled schools or whether we need to save those dollars to invest in teachers and programs.\"One in four schools--underused?We left a message for Mitchell, then asked the school district for elaboration.Joe Silva, assistant director for planning services, provided a spreadsheet listing each of the district’s 100-plus schools and whether each one is operating at, under or over the student capacity for which it was designed.Silva said the district has historically considered a campus under-enrolled if its school buildings, not counting portables, are at 75 percent capacity or less. He said the citizens task force set an under-capacity threshold of 85 percent.By the 85-percent threshold, 34 schools -- 31 percent -- are under-enrolled. By the usual district threshold, 22 schools -- 20 percent -- are under-filled. The calculations count both students who live in a school’s attendance zone and those attending via transfers.According to the spreadsheet, the district’s least-crowded school is Pearce Middle School, at 31 percent of capacity. The school normally serves more students; sixth grade wasn’t offered this year. Also least-crowded, according to the spreadsheet, are Becker Elementary, at 40 percent, and Blackshear Elementary, at 41 percent.Silva said that four of Becker’s permanent classrooms serve students shifted temporarily from their home schools to the disciplinary Alternative Center for Elementary Students. Those students aren’t counted in Becker’s enrollment calculation, he said, because the district can place the program at any location. Mary Saul, ACES’ director, told us that up to 36 students in the program occupy permanent classrooms at Becker.Silva initially told us that the district would describe under-enrolled schools as under capacity, not underutilized. That is, he said, many schools not filled with students still use their available space to offer add-on programs for students, families and the community. Also, he said, the district’s central administration places administrative and other staff in space available in the schools.He passed along campus survey results indicating that in 2009-10, 29 of the district’s 2,425 elementary classrooms, 1 percent, were used by principals for \"discretionary\" purposes, with others used for instruction, student and parental support or by district administrative staff.\"Very few campuses are underutilized,\" Silva said. \"But many are under capacity.\"Bumfuzzled? So were we, until Mitchell told us she’d said \"underutilized\" after seeing the term in a presentation to the school board.The 15-page presentation, \"Facility Master Plan, Board Update,\" was shown to the board Jan. 10. It includes a page titled \"Current Facility Inefficiencies\" with this subhead: \"Utilization (Permanent Capacity/Enrollment).\" The page says the target utilization for the district is 85 percent to 105 percent; 27 schools -- or 25 percent -- are below the bottom target figure and 55 schools are above it. Silva later told us the results differ from the breakdown he gave us because the presentation used 2009-10 enrollment totals and ours had more recent enrollment totals.So, 25 percent or so of the schools are below target capacity for students, but that’s not to say most of their space isn’t being used.In fact, a key consultant on the master plan, Carolyn Staskiewicz, president of Ohio-based DeJong-Richter, told us in an interview that \"utilization\" -- a term reflecting the students enrolled in a school divided by the school’s capacity--could give the erroneous impression that the schools aren’t fully used.At her suggestion, we poked into the term--underutilization--by contacting the Arizona-based Council on Educational Facility Planners International. Spokeswoman Barbara Worth pointed us to Ron Fanning, chairman of the board of Ohio-based Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc., among the nation’s largest school architecture firms. Fanning agreed with Staskiewicz’s definition of utilization, but said it’s not the only factor to weigh in judging a school’s value: \"You really have to look at each individual building\" on its merits, \"what it can hold, based on the programs being taught at that school... You can’t do a broad-brush statement.\"Stefan Pharis, who has a child at Barton Hills Elementary, told us the facilities task force has yet to take into account a comprehensive state measure of schools’ efficiency. According to online posts by the state comptroller’s office, the Financial Allocation Study for Texas (FAST), as ordered by the 2009 Legislature, reflects how districts and campuses spend their money -- and how the spending translates into student achievement.\"There’s an implication when you say (a school is) underutilized, that somehow they’re wasteful in terms of spending,\" Pharis said. According to the comptroller, he said, \"Some of these schools... excel academically and they do it at a cost-effective price.\"Our take: Mitchell’s statement accurately echoes the consultant-endorsed characterization of under-enrolled schools as being below their \"target\" utilization. However, \"underutilized\" is potentially misleading when applied to schools that may in fact be fully used, and could be targeted for closure as a result of that label. This is critical, missing context. We rate the statement Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A video showing a gigantic moon rolling across the Arctic sky and briefly blocking out the sun has gone viral, with many claiming it is real. The moon in the video is very large, and appears to be extremely close to earth, moving at an unnaturally fast speed across the sky. The video went viral around the same time that many people in parts of the world saw the first total lunar eclipse in more than two years. At the same time, on May 26, 2021, the world encountered a Super Flower Blood Moon. A “blood moon” occurs when the moon takes on a red hue as it aligns with the sun and Earth and passes fully into Earth’s shadow. The moon is also at its closest point in its orbit to the earth, making it appear larger and brighter than normal, earning it the title “super.” The first full moon in the month of May is also given the title “flower moon.” But the video in question appeared to defy all scientific explanation. A number of people shared the video with the same message attached, claiming that it was taking place “between Russia and Canada in the Arctic.” Imagine sitting in this place during the day (in between Russia and Canada in the Arctic) when the moon appears in this big size for 30 seconds and blocks the sun for 5 Seconds then disappears…Glory to God's own creation. pic.twitter.com/vw6CunJZTe Imagine sitting in this place during the day (between Russia and Canada in the Arctic). The moon appears at this size and then disappears in about 30 seconds and blocks the sun for five seconds ….on its way !Glory be to God Almighty !#LunarEclipse2021 #LunarEclipse pic.twitter.com/voH7B2btCj A few red flags that told us this video is a fake: First, there is no reflection of the moon in the lake below it. Also, according to NASA, the closest the moon can approach the earth is an average distance of about 226,000 miles (363,300 kilometers), and realistically at this time the moon only appears slightly larger than it normally does. The video makes the moon look like it is rolling unnaturally close to the earth, without the photographer zooming in, which is how most photographs or videos of this nature are taken. The creator of this video appears to be TikTok user @aleksey__nz, whose account showcases CGI (computer generated imagery) celestial bodies placed over scenes on earth. One video even shows an exploding moon. #moon #foryoupage #cosmos #2021 #Odessa #space The user seems to be experimenting with CGI animation and creating fantastical scenarios, and the above video is one such scenario. Given that the video is clearly a creative exercise in CGI, we rate this claim as “False.”\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Elon Musk could have given everyone in America $1 million (and still have had $7 billion left over) instead of purchasing Twitter for about $40 billion.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In the wake of the news that Elon Musk had purchased Twitter for $44 billion, a number of social media users suggested that the Tesla CEO’s money could have been better spent elsewhere. He could have, they suggested, solved world hunger or ended poverty. One viral tweet claimed that Musk could have given every single person in the United States $1 million (and still have $7 billion leftover) for roughly the purchase price of Twitter: The math here doesn’t quite add up. Using the population figure in the tweet, if Musk really decided to dole out $40 billion to everybody in the United States equally, every individual would get about $121.21. The number 1 billion is written as a 1 followed by nine zeroes, or 1,000,000,000. Another way to describe a billion is a “thousand millions.” Forty billion, then, is 40 thousand millions. If Musk were to hand out the $40 billion in $1 million increments, only 40 thousand people would receive a payment. This isn’t the first time that bad math has been employed to criticize people with vast amounts of wealth. In fact, the above-displayed tweet was followed up with a message about a similar incident in March 2020 when MSNBC anchor Brian Williams, while reading a viral tweet, said that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg could have given every American $1 million instead of spending $500 million on ads. Politifact did the math on that one and found that if Bloomberg’s $500 million for ad purchases were divvied out equally, every American would get about $1.53. “If that sounds too good to be true,” Politifact reported, “it’s because it is. A quick use of acalculatorshows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.” As of this writing, Musk is considered the richest person in the world, with a fortune of about $270 billion. While that’s not enough money to give every person in the United States $1 million, it is a fortune of near unfathomable size. In 2021, when Musk’s fortune was approximately $195 billion, YouTuber Humphrey Yang visualized Musk’s wealth with grains of rice.

            "claim [Claim]: \"We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff on Sept. 1, 2017, an editor mentioned major tax cuts adopted under Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981. At first, Ryan joked around. \"The music was bad in those days, and the tax laws were as well,\" he replied, chuckling. \"So, I think -- I’m not a big ‘80s music guy; I’m more of a ‘70s guy.\" But the 47-year-old Janesville Republican quickly got serious. Arguing that U.S. taxes are stopping U.S.-based multinational corporations from bringing giant sums of money to America, he stated: We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws. Ryan has made essentially the same claim a number of times, including on Milwaukee television, on CNBC, on Twitter and to the New York Times. So, do U.S. tax laws essentially prevent $3 trillion being held overseas from being brought to this country? Keep the word repatriate in mind. Taxing foreign earnings The object of Ryan’s criticism is the U.S. corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, as we reported in a Donald Trump fact check during the 2016 presidential campaign, it is among the highest in the world -- though it’s worth noting that, after deductions, companies typically pay an \"effective\" rate that can be much lower. (Trump, by the way, pledged during the presidential campaign to reduce the rate to 15 percent. That promise has been rated as In the Works on PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter.) As for the focus of Ryan’s claim, he’s talking about U.S.-based multinational corporations. More specifically, the foreign-earned profits of those companies. Here’s an example of how the taxation works: If the company earns income in a country with a 20 percent corporate tax rate, it would pay that 20 percent tax immediately to that country. If that money is then repatriated -- that is, brought back to the company’s U.S. headquarters -- the company would pay an additional 15 percent to the U.S. government. (In other words, the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus the 20 percent already paid to the foreign country.) So, as long as the profits stay parked overseas, there is no U.S. tax on it. Now to the specifics of Ryan’s claim. The $3 trillion figure To back up Ryan’s statement, his office cited an April 2017 CNBC news article that said American companies are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings, and the figure has been growing. That’s the latest estimate by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, for 2015, although an estimate done in July 2017 for PolitiFact National put the figure at $2.8 trillion. So, Ryan’s claim of about $3 trillion is reasonable. It’s worth noting that the figure has been rising. In fact, considering only the Russell 1000 index of large companies, the amount of parked cash overseas has more than doubled since 2008, as shown in a July 2017 report by the Massachusetts research firm Audit Analytics: Year Amount of foreign-earned profits by U.S.-based companies kept overseas 2008 $1.09 trillion 2009 $1.19 trillion 2010 $1.36 trillion 2011 $1.63 trillion 2012 $1.89 trillion 2013 $2.12 trillion 2014 $2.3 trillion 2015 $2.43 trillion 2016 $2.62 trillion ‘Trapped’ and ‘basically can’t come back’ Ryan asserts that the money is \"trapped overseas\" and \"basically can’t come back\" because of U.S. tax laws To be sure, a substantial amount of foreign profits are repatriated each year. But Ryan didn’t invent the term \"trapped cash.\" In fact, academics for years have referred to it as a commonly used term to describe the growing amount of cash held by U.S. multinationals overseas to avoid, or at least defer, paying the 35 percent U.S. tax rate. Ryan’s claim is also backed by September 2017 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Massachusetts. The paper found a dramatic increase in U.S. corporations holding onto cash; that the cash is concentrated in foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations; and that it is explained by low foreign tax rates. News articles also have reported on the phenomenon. In August 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook said of his company’s profits parked offshore: \"We’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it.\" Apple is second to Microsoft in the amount of cash parked overseas, according to Audit Analytics. And as the San Jose Mercury News reported in May 2017, the tax is such a deterrent that even though Apple was sitting on $240 billion in overseas cash, it has continued to borrow money. The reason: The borrowing cost Apple 4 percent or less, far below the 35 percent tax that would be paid for repatriating the overseas cash. One more point before we close: The companies would like to repatriate the money because bringing it back to the parent company enables them to do things such as paying dividends, doing stock buybacks and investing in U.S. operations. Several academic experts told us that some of the overseas money, while not repatriated directly back to the companies’ U.S. headquarters, is invested in U.S. securities. That doesn’t trigger the 35 percent tax. Our rating Ryan says: \"We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws.\" To avoid a 35 percent U.S. tax, U.S.-based multinational companies have opted not to \"repatriate\" roughly $3 trillion of their foreign profits, a figure that is growing. That is, they don’t bring the money back to their U.S. headquarters, where it can be used for things such as dividend payments or investments in their domestic operations. But the overseas profits aren’t literally trapped and indeed some foreign-earned profits are repatriated, though they are subject to the 35 percent tax. Ryan’s statement is accurate but needs additional information, our definition of Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Infamous Chicago Cubs fan Steve Bartman won $3.7 million after betting that the team would be in the 2016 World Series.\n",
            "[Evidences]:On 25 October 2016, the Satira Tribune web site published an published an article reporting that notorious Cubs fan Steve Bartman had won a $3.7 million wager after the Chicago Cubs defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to earn their first World Series appearance in more than 70 years: Infamous Cubs fan Steve Bartman won $3.7 million dollars on a bet he made on the Cubs 9 years ago in Las Vegas. At the time, the odds were 25000:1 but Bartman predicted the Cubs would defeat the Dodgers in 6 games in the year 2016. And that happened Saturday night in Chicago. The Vegas sports bookie issued a check for $3.7 million to Mr. Bartman. He can win an additional $22.5 million if the Cubs beat the Indians in 7 games this World Series. The Nevada Reporter interviewed Bartman who said, “It was a five dollar bet. I was a little drunk and the bookie egged me into to. I finally said ‘you know what? The Cubs will win the Pennant in 2016 against the Dodgers’, and they did. Guess who has the last laugh now. There was no truth to this story. Bartman, who infamously interfered with a fly ball during the National League Championship Series in 2003 (and was widely blamed for costing the Cubs the pennant), did not place a $5 bet in Las Vegas in 2005 that the Chicago Cubs would beat the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the pennant in 2016, he didn’t give a recent interview to the Nevada Reporter, and he did not win $3.7 million. The Satira Tribune is a fake news web site that publishes “satirical and futuristic news.” While Bartman’s $3.7 million World Series prediction originated with a fake news story, another Chicago Cubs prediction that made its way around the internet in October 2016 appeared to be genuine. In 1993, a high school student used his senior yearbook quote to predict a 2016 World Series victory for the Chicago Cubs.\n",

            "[Evidences]:About this rating A viral screenshot appears to show a 2021 tweet from billionaire Bill Gates and claims that Gates was poking fun in the tweet atconspiracy theories about his supposedly using the coronavirus pandemic as a cover to implant trackable microchips in the world's population. The screenshot, which spread on Reddit in August 2023, purported to show a tweet from Gates' official account on the platform that has been rebranded as Xwhich stated: \"The tracking chip was in the MAGA flags. That [sic] how we have been rounding up the 6th Protesters so quickly.\" The caption accompanying the screenshot stated, \"At least Bill Gates has a sense of humor about it!\" (Screenshot via RedditB) This screenshot is fake. Gates never tweeted this, although his Twitter account has occasionallypoked fun at the same conspiracy theory about secretly implanting microchips in people in the past. Our first indication that the screenshot was fake emerged from the grammatical and spelling errors in the screenshot. Phrases like \"That how\" and \"6th Protesters\" indicated that this would not come from the official account of Gates, who otherwise has a very carefully managed profile with little to no spelling errors that we have encountered. Secondly, just below the tweet, blue text states \"Twitter for elites\" indicating that this screenshot itself is a joke poking fun at Gates. We also looked through Gates' Twitter account. All tweets prior to Feb. 17, 2021had been deleted. We then looked through his account, which has been archived on PolitiTweet's database, and noted that he did not tweet on Jan. 23, 2021. One tweet had been deleted on Jan. 22, 2021, for a typo, but it was about American leadership on climate change, which had nothing to do with the microchips joke. Furthermore, had Gates actually tweeted such a joke, it would have been headline news and analyzed by both his critics and his fans, given his high profile. The fake tweet referred to a long-running conspiracy theoryclaiming that through his work at the Gates Foundation, the billionaire used the pandemic as a cover to implant trackable microchips in populations across the world by vaccinating them. We have fact-checked variations of this theory many times. In June 2022, Gates even joked about the theory in response to a joke from \"The Daily Show's\" official Twitter account: I guess we finally ran out of microchips. https://t.co/dptfYIGl4k — Bill Gates (@BillGates) June 15, 2022 Given that the above screenshot was clearly fabricated, and we found no evidence in Gates' archived Twitter account that he posted such a tweet, we rate this claim as False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:If you heard Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno on the Brian Lehrer Show on May 11, you'd think New Jersey didn’t have any foreign trade offices for at least a decade until the administration of Gov. Chris Christie set up outposts in Shanghai and London, which led to a big surge in exports.In the middle of her statewide tour to highlight New Jersey’s commitment to economic growth, Guadagno did a radio interview on the WNYC program. After discussing the state’s effort to attract jobs from the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, the conversation turned to where Guadagno said the \"real game\" is -- overseas.Here’s how Guadagno summed up New Jersey’s international outreach:\"It's no longer just a regional market. It's attracting business from overseas. And New Jersey, for the past decade, hasn't had any offices overseas. Compare that to Pennsylvania (that) has 23. Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent.\"Fred Snowflack, a spokesman for Guadagno, said the offices in Shanghai and London opened last year through a joint effort between the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Two people are stationed in Shanghai and one person is in London, Snowflack said.According to a September 2010 press release announcing the deal, the duties of the foreign trade representatives include helping to advance export sales of New Jersey companies and arranging visits for potential investors. The London office covers the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.PolitiFact New Jersey also confirmed that Pennsylvania has 23 foreign trade offices covering 67 countries. So she is right on that point.But she's wrong on two other key points: that the state lacked foreign trade offices for the past decade and that the two new ones led to the 18 percent increase in exports.Actually, a total of 10 full- and part-time overseas offices were in operation during the past decade.New Jersey had full-time offices in Tokyo from 1988-2006; London, 1994-2004; Ra’anana, Israel, 1995-2007; Mexico City, 1999-2006; Cairo, 2000-2004; and Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2000-2007. The state had part-time offices in South Korea from 1999-2004; Greece, 2000-2004; China, 2001-2004; and Argentina, 2001-2002.Snowflack told us those offices closed for financial reasons. Asked about the discrepancy between Guadagno’s radio interview and the information on previous offices, Snowflack wrote in an email:\"As for the other question, the lieutenant governor has said on many other occasions, including her budget testimony of last year, that the offices were closed during the Corzine Administration. I submit that the important point here is that the state has reopened overseas offices, not the exact year in which some of the old ones closed.\"Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce back up the 18 percent increase in exports. Those exports included chemicals, computers and electronic products, and transportation equipment.But that's a figure for exports throughout the world and an economics professor expressed doubt that the new offices deserve much credit.\"I wish economics were that easy,\" Rutgers University professor Thomas Prusa said.Snowflack told us Guadagno was not linking the export increases to the new offices.\"She was not saying that the two new offices were directly responsible for the increase in exports,\" Snowflack wrote in an email. \"Her point was that New Jersey is trying to rekindle business relationships overseas, as evidenced by an increase in exports and two new offices. But she never said two offices that opened within the last year prompted an 18 percent increase in exports.\"That may have been what she meant, but listeners who heard her would clearly be under the impression there was a link. She said, \"Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent.\"Her wording suggests a clear linkage.Let’s review:Guadagno said New Jersey has opened foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London, marking the first in at least a decade. She’s right about those two offices, but she’s wrong to say such international efforts haven’t been done before. In fact, New Jersey had 10 offices at various times during the past decade.And there's little, if any, evidence that the offices led to the 18 percent increase. We find her statement False.

The Hindi-language caption translates as: “Sardarji is shouting ‘down with Modi government’, which is understandable, but why is he shouting long live Pakistan and long live Khalistan.” Sardarji is a title used before the name of Sikh men. Khalistan is a Sikh political ideology calling for an independent homeland. Sikh men typically wear turbans. The misleading post was shared as farmers in India demonstrate against new agriculture laws and block key highways on the outskirts of the capital. Here is an AFP report on the issue. The video was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter, alongside similar claims. But the video is being shared in a misleading context. A reverse image search on Yandex led to this YouTube video posted on July 1, 2019, as well as a Snapchat video uploaded on TikTok on the same date. The video was also posted here on a Facebook group named “Khalistan youth” that regularly posts Sikh seperatist content on its page. The videos show a stadium with crowds waving the Pakistan flag as well as the Afghanistan flag in the back. The TikTok video also shows a blue roof with the word “Headingley” plastered on it. Below is a screenshot of the TikTok video that shows the blue roof: The 2019 Cricket World Cup match between Pakistan and Afghanistan was held on June 29 in the Headingley Carnegie Stadium. News reports indicate that pro-Khalistan and Pakistan slogans were shouted during the Pakistan and Afghanistan cricket match.

            "[Evidences]:The data from the Pfizer vaccine trial was misquoted, and the severe cases observed among the participants were not related to the vaccine. The Covid Alliance in Canada is an anti-vaccine website. The six-month data from the Pfizer vaccine was manipulated in one of its videos to discredit the vaccination. It says that Pfizer's evidence reveals that the COVID-19 vaccine causes serious harm. Pfizer's data, on the other hand, refutes this assertion. The Canadain Covid alliance claims increased sickness and death based on ''Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine through 6 Months,'' a study published in New England Journal of Medicine. But the study states that despite a steady decline in vaccine efficacy over six months of follow-up, the BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine had favorable long-term safety results and was highly effective in preventing COVID-19. About 45,441 people from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Germany, and Turkey took part in the study between July 27 and October 29, 2020. Half of the participants were given the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, while others received a placebo. The participants were re-evaluated six months later. The vaccine was safe and had a low risk of side effects. A small number of participants had negative experiences that caused them to drop out of the study. Through six months of follow-up, vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 was 91.3 percent. After the second dose, only 77 cases of COVID-19 with an onset of 7 days or more were reported in vaccine recipients, and there were 850 cases in the placebo group. Thirty patients with severe COVID-19 were in the placebo group, while one was in the vaccine group. Vaccination was not associated with deaths among those who took part in the trial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that deaths reported following COVID-19 vaccination are uncommon. Even if the vaccine was not the cause, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires healthcare practitioners to report any mortality following COVID-19 vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Adverse event reports to VAERS, including deaths, may not always indicate that a vaccine is responsible for a health problem. However, no COVID-19 vaccination is certified to be 100 percent effective. For people with conditions linked to a higher risk of severe disease, the Pfizer vaccination has proven to be safe and effective, states WHO. Furthermore, vaccination was not linked to any deaths among the participants in the research, and there is no increase in illnesses in the data. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation.

            "[Evidences]:Virtually speaking before world leaders, President Rodrigo Duterte again sang a different tune on Wednesday, positively this time, when he declared that no country can “diminish” the importance of the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in favor of the Philippines against China. STATEMENT In a pre-recorded speech at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Sept. 22 (Philippine time), Duterte affirmed the country’s commitment to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other stakeholders in ensuring “peace, security and prosperity” in the South China Sea. He said: “The 1982 UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral award of the South China Sea provide a clear path towards a just, fair and win-win solution for all. The award must be seen for what it is — a benefit across the world to all who subscribe to the majesty of the law. No amount of willful disregard by any country, however big and powerful, can diminish the arbitral award’s importance.” Source: RTVMalacanang, Message for the 76th United Nations General Assembly (Speech) 9/22/2021, Sept. 22, 2021, watch from 12:41 to 13:18 (transcript) Duterte also called on all countries to commit to the “rule of law” to maintain global order. FACT Duterte’s UNGA speech is yet another turnaround on how he invokes the PCA decision favoring the Philippines which he had downplayed on other occasions when he spoke extemporaneously. In an ad lib during his sixth and last State of the Nation Address (SONA) in July, Duterte recalled his speech at the UNGA last year in which he “firmly reject[ed]” attempts to “undermine” the arbitral award. He then backtracked, recognizing China’s refusal to accept the decision: “Ano pa ang gusto ninyo (What more do you want)? What will I do with a document that [does] not bind China because they were never a part of that arbitration? There was really no arbitration at all because it was only the Philippine side [that] was heard.” Source: Presidential Communications Operations Office, State of the Nation Address of Rodrigo Roa Duterte, President of the Philippines to the Congress of the Philippines, July 26, 2021, watch from 2:07:30 to 2:08:02 (Archived Transcript) (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte is wrong; South China Sea arbitral award binds China, too – Vera Files) Prior to his SONA, Duterte contradicted his September 2020 UNGA speech when he claimed in a May 5, 2021 public address that the arbitral decision is “just a piece of paper” he would throw into the wastebasket. Several times since 2016, Duterte has changed his tune on the PCA ruling. In September 2019, he went from “invoking” to “ignoring” the arbitral win in order to pursue more “economic” agreements with China. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte shifts from ‘invoking’ to ‘ignoring’ the PCA ruling) Duterte falsely claimed on May 3, 2021, that he “never mentioned” the maritime dispute between the Philippines and China during his campaign for the 2016 presidential elections. Seven days later, he called his infamous campaign promise to ride a jet ski and hoist the Philippine flag on the Spratly Island Group as just “bravado” or a “pure campaign joke.” (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte claims he ‘never mentioned’ PH-China maritime row in 2016 campaign. He did.) In July 2016, barely 12 days after Duterte assumed the presidency, the PCA held in its “final and binding” award that China’s nine-dash line has “no legal basis” to claim ownership of the entire South China Sea, of which the West Philippine Sea is part. The Netherlands-based arbitral tribunal also declared, among other findings, that certain maritime features in the South China Sea — including Panganiban (Mischief) Reef and Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, which are both part of the Spratly Island Group — are within the Philippines’ 200 nautical miles exclusive economic zone. Contrary to claims that the arbitral award is not valid, the PCA affirmed that China is bound to comply with its decisions as a signatory since June 1996 to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). “[T]he non-participation of China does not bar this Tribunal from proceeding with the arbitration. China is still a party to the arbitration, and pursuant to the terms of Article 296(1) of the Convention and Article 11 of Annex VII, it shall be bound by any award the Tribunal issues.” Source: Permanent Court of Arbitration, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (p. 11), Oct. 29, 2016 Despite China’s deliberate non-participation in the three-year arbitral proceedings, the tribunal assured that it did not “simply accept” the evidence and claims of the Philippines. It also took note of the position paper and public statements, among other documents, from the Chinese foreign ministry and Beijing’s ambassador to the Netherlands regarding the arbitration case.

The photo was tweeted alongside a similar claim in English and in Urdu. Similar posts on Facebook and Twitter have shared another photo showing passengers of what appears to be the same boat falling into the sea. Both photos were also shared together in a tweet here. The posts -- shared over 800 times -- surfaced online days after a fishing trawler carrying hundreds of migrants capsized and sank off Greece in the Ionian Sea on the night of June 13, 2023. The incident happened within sight of the Greek coastguard and left at least 82 people dead. Authorities in Europe still have no clear idea how many people were aboard the boat when it sank -- estimates range from 400 to over 700 -- but likely hundreds came from Pakistan, with many from Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Reverse image searches on Google, however, found the photos have been shared with false context. Both pictures were published by AFP here and here on May 25, 2016 (archived links here and here).

(For clarity, we’ll exclude the unemployment claim.)First, the history of this line of attack.Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked into a claim from Romney that the median income in America had dropped by 10 percent in the last four years. At that time, the drop was $4,600 or 8.3 percent, based on a study by former Census bureau income experts at Sentier Research.We rated that claim Half True because the figure was outdated and somewhat off the mark.Also in June, we looked at a Romney surrogate’s claim that \"the average income for a family in Massachusetts went up by $5,500\" when Romney was governor from 2003-2007.That also got a Half True because the dollar figure, while accurate, was not adjusted for inflation. In addition, we ruled that governors have only marginal impact on their states’ economies.In his Janesville address, Ryan tossed the Obama and Romney records into one claim.That’s a claim-changer, because the numbers are apples and oranges.The declining incomes Ryan cites in the last four years were in real dollars -- inflation adjusted to show the true effect on purchasing power -- while the gains in household income under Romney were not inflation-adjusted.Applying the \"real\" dollar analysis to the income trend under Romney, there was a drop in Massachusetts household incomes, not a $5,000 bump up, a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation researcher told PolitiFact in June.This week we asked Gary Burtless, a former U.S. Labor Department economist with the Brookings Institution, to check that. He found a $589 drop, about 1 percent, compared to a nationwide increase of 1.4 percent.There’s nothing wrong with using unadjusted dollars, but economists we consulted said using real dollars is a better real-world way of gauging income trends.And by mixing the two methods, Ryan creates a much larger gap between the 2003-2007 experience and the 2009-2012 numbers.\"It's definitely not kosher to use inflation-adjusted numbers in one case and nominal numbers in the other case,\" Daniel Mitchell, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us. When inflation is high enough to wipe away nominal gains in income, as in the Massachusetts example, \"that makes it even more important to use apples-to-apples comparisons,\" he added.Recession roleRyan talked about a decline in median household income \"in the last four years.\"That would reach back to mid-2008 near the end of the Republican administration of George W. Bush. The Great Recession began during the Bush era, in December 2007.Let’s look back four years, using the Sentier Research study, which was the source used in a now-outdated Bloomberg News story that Ryan’s campaign cites to back up his claim of a $4,000 drop. (Though census data income data is the gold standard for these statistics, it has not been released for 2011 or 2012).The Sentier data, current through June 2012, shows a $3,317 drop in median household income since June 2008. That’s a 6 percent dip.Ryan said the decline was an \"average of $4,000,\" so he’s off going back four years.But if you assume Ryan was informally using \"four years\" as a proxy for Obama’s term so far, it’s a $4,019 drop.Our ratingRyan said in a convention send-off speech that Obama deserves blame for household incomes nationally tumbling $4,000, while Romney deserves credit for incomes growing a substantial $5,000 in Massachusetts when Romney governed that state.Earlier in the campaign, when Romney made these two claims separately, we found them partially accurate.But when they are combined, they leave a false impression of polar-opposite trend lines because one is adjusted for inflation, while the other is not.Applying the same inflation-adjusted methodology that Ryan chose to show the $4,000 household income drop under Obama, median incomes actually fell $589 under Romney during his earlier stint as governor.Ryan also affixes too much blame or credit on the pair for the trends.We rate this statement False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: In September 2019, U.S. House Democrats voted for a bill that would create an electronic health record system for immigrants on the southern border which does not yet exist for military veterans.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In September and October 2019, we received multiple inquiries about the accuracy of news reports that claimed U.S. House Democrats had voted in favor of an electronic health records (EHR) system for undocumented immigrants at the southern border with Mexico, while also rejecting a similar system for U.S. military veterans. On Sept. 28, the right-leaning Western Journal website published an article with the headline “Dems Vote to Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service.” The article reported that: “House Democrats voted Thursday to fast-track an electronic medical records system that would serve illegal immigrants, something America’s veterans have been seeking for years … The Democratic proposal would require the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to create an Electronic Health Record system … The bill gives the DHS 90 days after the bill receives final approval to get the job done. In contrast, the Veterans Administration has been working for years to implement an EHR system for veterans.” The article was given wider exposure when it was tweeted out by former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential primary candidate Mike Huckabee, who added: “Before Dems headed home to mingle with forgotten [people] who sent them to DC, they passed bill to fast-track an electronic medical records system for illegal immigrants but voted down a GOP plan to provide same for veterans, who have to wait 10 yrs for it.” Before Dems headed home to mingle with forgotten ppl who sent them to DC, they passed bill to fast-track an electronic medical records system for illegal immigrants but voted down a GOP plan to provide same for veterans, who have to wait 10 yrs for it.https://t.co/6C3xCxbNZj — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) September 30, 2019 In a similar vein, “Young Conservatives” wrote an article which was published and hosted on the website Chicks on the Right, and had theheadline, “Dems Vote to Give Illegal Aliens Better Healthcare System Than What’s at the VA or DoD.” That post claimed that: “Democrats flexed the true might of their majority in the House on Thursday when they voted to give illegal immigrants living in the United States an electronic medical records system that is better than the one currently being used at the Veterans Affairs Administration or the Department of Defense.” In support of the claim that House Democrats had rejected the opportunity to propose the same EHR system for veterans as it was proposing for immigrants, Western Journal cited comments made by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. In a tweet, Burchett wrote, “Amendment to give veterans same healthcare as illegals fails. Are you kidding me?” In an accompanying video, Burchett said the bill had related to “providing healthcare benefits to illegal aliens,” adding “When the Republicans attempted to put an amendment on there that made it so that our veterans would receive the same benefits, oddly enough they voted against that amendment …” Amendment to give VETERANS same healthcare as ILLEGALS fails. Are you kidding me? We are so out of wack. pic.twitter.com/eYgqkklrMW — Tim Burchett (@timburchett) September 26, 2019 In support of its claims, Young Conservatives cited comments made by Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., writing: The claims made by Western Journal, Huckabee, Burchett, Young Conservatives, and Walker were largely inaccurate and grossly misleading. An EHR system already exists for veterans In reality, an electronic health record system (EHR) already exists for veterans in the U.S., and has done so for years. What House Republicans alluded to were improvements to that system, scheduled to be implemented over the next decade, whose delays in implementation have proven controversial. The enhanced, modernized, updated EHR system for veterans and serving military members is not the same as the comparatively rather basic EHR system being proposed, for the first time, for immigrants stopped at the U.S. border. What the immigrant bill actually proposed A bill passed by the House on Sept. 26 (H.R. 3525) proposed introducing an EHR system related to immigrants stopped crossing into the United States, but it did not propose giving them any specific “healthcare benefits,” as Burchett falsely claimed. It certainly did not propose a “better healthcare system” or better EHR system for immigrants stopped at the border than currently exists in relation to serving military personnel or military veterans, as Young Conservatives falsely claimed. The full text of the legislation, introduced by Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., can be read here. Roughly speaking, it proposes two innovations: What House Republicans proposed (and Democrats rejected) The Republican proposal that Democrats rejected during the course of the debate would not have provided veterans what was proposed, in Underwood’s bill, for immigrants crossing the border. That claim, as made by Burchett and Huckabee, was false for two reasons. First, an EHR system already exists for veterans, so veterans therefore already have what the bill proposed for immigrants. Second, the Republican proposal did not actually propose any services, whether new services or an expansion of existing services, for veterans. Rather, it proposed delaying the implementation of the immigrant EHR system until 2027, the date on which the roll out of the new, improved veterans EHR system is expected to be completed. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., introduced the “motion to recommit” (to send the bill back to the Homeland Security committee for reconsideration), which included the 2027 delay proposal. From the floor of the House, Green said: Despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain … The very benefits that Congresswoman Underwood, in this bill, advances for illegal aliens flooding across our southern border — our veterans don’t have those benefits. Let me say that again. This bill, without the amendment I’m asking this body to consider, advances healthcare services to illegal aliens, before it does our American heroes. The VA secretary testified before Congress that it will take his department 10 years to fully deploy this new system … This timelines states that our veterans will not get an interoperable electronic health record [system] at all VA facilities until September 20, 2027 … All this amendment does is ensure our veterans get this service first. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are giving an electronic medical health record [system] to illegal aliens, before our veterans. That claim was false. As we have explained already, the VA has had an EHR system for years, as Green himself acknowledged just moments earlier, when he said “despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain.” If Green and others were to propose that, as a matter of principle, Congress ought to implement the new and improved VA EHR system before it creates any EHR system for immigrants detained along the southern border, that would be a subjective value judgment to which nobody could pose any factual objection. However, the specific and explicit factual claim made by Green and others was that Underwood’s bill would provide, in the context of immigrants detained at the border, an EHR system that does not yet exist for veterans, and will not fully exist until 2027. That claim was false. The only accurate element in the foregoing news articles and pronouncements was the claim that House Democrats had introduced a bill that would create an EHR system relating to immigrants detained along the southern border. As such, we issue a rating of “Mostly False.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:On March 22, 2021, a 21-year-old man allegedly walked into a King Soopers supermarketin Boulder, Colorado, with a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol and killed 10 people. As investigators sought evidence to determine what, exactly, drove the suspected gunman, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, to go on the killing rampage, rumors about his background and prior affiliations circulated widely online. Specifically, social media posts, like the one displayed below, alleged he identified as Muslim and disagreed with former U.S. President Donald Trump. (See here for facts about Alissa’s birth country and when he emigrated to the U.S.) Before we investigate the legitimacy of those assertions regarding Trump and Islam, let this be clear: There was not enough evidence as of this writing to explain why Alissa, who lives in the Denver suburb of Arvada, allegedly opened fire at the crowded supermarket in Boulder. Two anonymous law enforcement sources told journalists there was nothing to indicate his political or religious ideologies played a role in his alleged actions. For example, court documents provided to Snopes by the Boulder County District Attorney’s office that detail how and, under what circumstances, authorities took Alissa into custody make no mention of him expressing his personal beliefs during or after the shooting. That said, it was true that at least three people who knew Alissa, including his brother, confirmed with journalists that he believed in Islam, and archived screenshots of the suspected killer’s Facebook activity obtained by Snopes showed he referred to himself as a member of the Muslim community. For example, after speaking to Ali Aliwi Alissa, the suspect’s 34-year-old brother, CNN reported: “The brother told CNN on Tuesday that in high school bullies made fun of Alissa’s name and for being Muslim and that may have contributed to him becoming ‘anti-social.'” He attended Arvada West High School from 2015 until he graduated in 2018, and he was on the wrestling team his junior and senior years, reported The Denver Post. Two people who identified as his former wrestling teammates — Dayton Marvel and Angel Hernandez — spoke to the news outlet after the mass shooting, saying: Hernandez said Alissa frequently appeared to be paranoid about perceived slights against him, and Marvel said Alissa was often concerned about being targeted because of his Muslim faith. ‘He would talk about him being Muslim and how if anybody tried anything, he would file a hate crime and say they were making it up,’ Marvel said. Another man named Damien Cruz who claimed to be a friend of the suspect also told journalists Alissa complained about islamophobia and people’s prejudices against him because of his Syrian background and name. “He talked about how Muslims were all treated poorly,” Cruz said. Additionally, Alissa repeatedly expressed pro-Islam sentiments or promoted aspects of the faith online, according to our analysis of archived screenshots of his Facebook page that the social media platform permanently deleted after his arrest. On March 31, 2019, for example, he listed virtues such as decency and forgiveness, with the caption: “What Islam is really about.” Also, around the same time, Alissa authored a Facebook post from denouncing the actions of a white supremacist who shot and killed 51 people at two Christchurch mosques in New Zealand. “The Muslims at the #christchurch mosque were not the victims of a single shooter. They were the victims of the entire Islamophobia industry that vilified them,” that post read. Months later, in July 2019, he expressed fears that someone was targeting his phone because of his religious beliefs. “Yeah if these racist islamophobic people would stop hacking my phone and let me have a normal life I probably could,” he wrote. As far as Alissa’s political leanings, it was true that he criticized specific actions of Trump and his far-right supporters, though nothing on the Facebook page or in news stories after the supermarket shooting explicitly outlined his overall perception of the former president. On Nov. 8, 2016, days after Trump’s presidential victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the suspected shooter authored the below-displayed Facebook post that said he would “remain optimistic” with Trump in the White House. Additionally, at least one Facebook post (displayed below) bluntly criticized the former president’s approach to immigration. “[Trump] could do whatever he wants and his base would still support him regardless of what he says or does,” another post by Alissa read. Like Snopes, the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online extremism, analyzed an archived version of Alissa’s Facebook profile after the supermarket shooting. It found no evidence of him expressing “any radical or extremist views” on the platform. “We still don’t know what his motive was, or if he had one at all. But what I can say is that based on what I’ve seen of his social media presence, he didn’t even remotely suggest having radical Islamist leanings, or really radical leanings of any kind,” said Rita Katz, executive director of SITE, according to The Washington Post. In sum, we rate this claim “true.” The suspected gunman considered himself Muslim and criticized Trump and/or his supporters online. As of this writing, Alissa had just made his first court appearance, where he didn’t speak other than to say “yes” to a question from the judge, according to The Associated Press. Prosecutors advised him of the 10 charges of first-degree murder he faces.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A theme is emerging in New Jersey’s U.S. Senate race: opponents blaming one another for bloating government debt.Republican challenger state Sen. Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTV’s \"On the Record\" that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges.\"Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory,\" Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos’ watch.Then, Menendez said: \"Here's someone who raided the state's -- voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.\"Kyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the state’s pension system.To be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitman’s overall impact on the pension system. We’re looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off.Both statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found.The bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the state’s Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers.A separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds.The move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget.Melissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said \"skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds' obligations.\"Whitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid.Now, what’s the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029?Menendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system.Treasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said it’s unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said.Ultimately, the state’s general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million.Castro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. \"Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy,\" she said.Our rulingMenendez said Kyrillos \"voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.\"Kyrillos voted in favor of borrowing $2.75 billion to put into the state’s pension funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid nearly $600 million in pension payments that year, but overall, money went into the system, not out of it. To call it a vote to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion is inaccurate.Also, the bonds will cost taxpayers, in total, about $10.1 billion, not $15 billion.We rate this claim False.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n",

It claims that there was a “4,250% increase in fetal deaths reported to VAERS after flu shot given to pregnant women” and concludes that the flu shot “was causing a massive spike in fetal deaths”. The article bases its claim in part on a 2012 study which reported that the number of fetal losses recorded in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), increased from 4 during the single-vaccine 2008/2009 season to 174 during the two-vaccine 2009/2010 season[1]. The study’s author attributes this to a “toxicity effect” from the double dose of the flu vaccine that pregnant women received during the 2009/2010 season. The increase in the number of fetal losses between the two seasons was indeed 4,250%, but these losses occurred in different sized population groups. Therefore, this number does not reflect an increase in the rate of fetal loss. In addition, the study contains several major flaws. Firstly, the VAERS data used in the study include all adverse events that follow vaccination whether they were proven to have been caused by the vaccine or not. Adverse events can be reported by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members, and as VAERS states, “no proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the [adverse event] report.” Secondly, Goldman did not examine whether the vaccinated women were at risk for spontaneous abortion due to other factors, such as advanced maternal age, smoking, or alcohol use, which may have contributed to the increase in fetal losses between the two seasons. Thirdly, spontaneous abortions also occur in unvaccinated pregnant women, but Goldman did not compare the rates of spontaneous abortion between unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Therefore, the study does not show that the flu vaccine causes an increased risk of fetal loss because it did not investigate whether the risk associated with vaccination is actually higher than the baseline rate. In short, the study’s author mistakenly concluded that the fetal losses must be the result of the flu shot simply because they occurred at some point after vaccination (this is known as the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). Numerous studies, as well as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, have reported that the inactivated flu vaccine is safe for pregnant women and unborn children[2,3,4], and that thimerosal used in the flu vaccine is not a cause for concern. Furthermore, by reducing the risk of influenza infection, the flu shot may actually prevent congenital abnormalities associated with maternal respiratory infection, as shown by a review and meta-analysis of more than 20 studies[5]. Infants born to women who are severely ill with influenza are also more likely to have poorer outcomes, such as low birth weight and Apgar scores[6,7,8,9]. REFERENCES\n",

            "claim [Claim]: 92-year-old Pam Nelson of Victoria, Texas, was unable to vote because of new laws requiring voters to present ID.\n",
            "[Evidences]:On 13 April 2016, the Facebook page “Occupy Democrats” published the above-reproduced image meme statingthat 92-year-old Pam Nelson of Victoria, Texas, was unable to vote in her state’s primary because of a new law requiring voters to present photo ID at the polls: This is 92-year-old Pam Nelson from Victoria, Texas. She’s voted in every election she’s ever been eligible for. Due to Texas’ new “voter ID law” she WASN’T able to vote in last month’s primary. She tried several times to get an ID but couldn’t wait the hours in line required. She tried to get an ID by mail, but you can’t do that if you’re over 70. Share if you agree “voter ID” laws are voter suppression! The post did not include links to any news articles or other media providing more information about “Pam Nelson” or her inability to vote. We were unable to find any other articles providing information about the claim, andwe were unable even to locate anyone by that name in or near Victoria, Texas. Eventually, “Occupy Democrats” contacted us to say that, oh, the woman in the meme wasn’t named Pam Nelson, as they stated; rather, Pam Nelson was her granddaughter’s name (and the woman herself was named Bernice). In 2011, the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 14 (SB 14), creating a new requirement for voters to show photo identification when voting in person. Acceptable forms of identificationinclude the following: · Texas driver license issued by Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) · Texas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS · Texas personal identification card issued by DPS · Texas license to carry a handgun issued by DPS · United State military identification card containing the person’s photograph · United States citizenship certificate containing the person’s photograph · United States passport The reference to age in the meme suggests that “Bernice” had an expired driver’s license and was unable to renew it in time to use it as ID for voting because Texans over the age of 70 can’t renew their licenses by mail, and the lines at her local Department of Public Safety (DPS) were too long for her. This isn’t quite correct: Texas DPS requires that persons 79 (not 70) or older must always renew their licenses in person because they must take a vision test. Still, wasn’t “Bernice” effectively disenfranchised from voting by this requirement? Not fully. For starters, Texas allows driver’s licenses to be renewed up to one year before their expiration date, and Texas voter ID laws allow the acceptance of an approved form of ID up to 60 days after its expiration date — so “Bernice” had a fourteen-month span during which she could have renewed her license in time to vote, including a full two months after its expiration. Moreover, Texas allows residents lacking current driver’s licenses to obtain an Election Identification Certificate (EIC) as a form of valid voter ID. EICs are available at a variety of locations other than Texas DPS offices (and their presumably lengthy lines). As well, a person lacking a valid form of photo identification at the polls may still cast a provisional ballot, which provides that person up to six days after the election to present him/herself to the county voter registrar and present appropriate photo identification. If the provisional voter presents the photo identification to the county voter registrar within the six-day period and meets all other requirements, then the provisional ballot must be accepted. Finally, and most important, Texas allows persons aged 65 or older to vote by mail, a form of voting that does not require the presentation of a current piece of photo ID. Subsequent Facebook posts indicated that “Bernice” (who is actually 97) could indeed have voted by mail but … didn’t want to. So apparently this issue was far less a case of voter disenfranchisement than it was an instance of the democratic process taking a backseat to personal preference.\n",

            "[Evidences]:One of the catch phrases for the stimulus has been \"timely, targeted, temporary.\" Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the bill was none of those things, attacking it on the Senate floor on Feb. 5, 2009. We were particularly interested in his claim that it was not timely. The Congressional Budget Office, Roberts said, \"estimates that only 15 percent of this stimulus package will be spent in 2009; 37 percent, 2010; the remaining part spent in 2011 and beyond. Less than half the money will be spent by the end of next year. This is not immediate relief that families and businesses desperately need now to help get the economy back on track.\" We wondered about this because Democrats counter that the bill is timely, with as much as 80 percent of the money being spent in the first two years. Roberts' office pointed us toward a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated Jan. 28, 2009. There it is in black and white: \"About 15 percent of that spending would occur in the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009; another 37 percent would be spent in 2010. A total of almost 80 percent of the cumulative 11-year spending would occur from 2009 through 2011.\" Case closed, right? Not quite. The numbers the CBO referred to applied to spending from the House version of the bill introduced on Jan. 26, but left out what many people consider a key stimulative impact of the bill: its tax cuts. Also, the CBO considered spending according to fiscal years, which begin on Oct. 1. So when the CBO said that spending for 2009 is only 15 percent, it meant spending by Sept. 30, 2009, not the full calendar year. Additionally, Roberts made his remarks on Feb. 5. Yet, just three days earlier, the CBO had published a new analysis on the Senate version of the bill. The Senate version got its spending out of the gate faster: Using the same method of looking at only spending and not tax cuts, the CBO data showed that 20 percent would be spent in 2009, and 38 percent in 2010. That would push the money spent in those two years to 59 percent, which would be more than half spent by the end of the fiscal year 2010, which is Sept. 30, 2010. If you include the tax cuts in the Senate version, the bill's overall impact for 2009 and 2010 are 79 percent of the total package. So that is where the Democrats got their numbers in response. All are legitimate numbers from CBO reports, depending on how you pick and choose the data. Finally we should also note that none of this data addresses the late-night compromise reached by Democrats and three Republican senators on Feb. 6, 2009. As of this writing on Feb. 9, the CBO analysis of the compromise was still in the works. So we have several problems with Roberts' use of the CBO numbers. He uses numbers for a House bill in a Senate debate, when data on the Senate version has been available for several days. He refers to the stimulus \"package,\" but he uses figures that take into account spending only, ignoring the benefits of tax cuts. His statement leaves the impression that the Senate bill would do little by the end of 2010, and we find there's a lot in the CBO data to contradict that. For these reasons, we rate his statement Barely True. \n",

            "[Evidences]:Referring to PM Modi's speech, several users claimed that Manik Saha, whom the BJP wanted to be removed four years ago, has now been brought back by as CM. After Biplab Kumar Deb resigned as the Chief Minister of Tripura, an old speech of Prime minister Narendra Modi has now gone viral on social media. Several users claimed that Manik Saha, whom the BJP wanted to be removed four years ago, has now been brought back as the chief minister. Multiple social media users have posted the portion of the speech of PM Modi where he can be heard urging people to replace Manik (ruby) with “Hira” (diamond) in Tripura. The caption says: PM Modi had told the people of Tripura 4 years ago-\"Now you don't want a Manik, get rid of Manik. Now you need diamonds. Do you want a diamond or not? \" Today, BJP has snatched the diamond and brought back Manik Saha as Tripura's new chief minister. Another Facebook caption in Hindi reads, \"Now you don't want Manik Saha, get rid of Manik Saha. Now you need diamonds. Do you want a diamond or not?’ Today, BJP has elected Tripura Chief and Rajya Sabha MP Dr. Manik Saha as the new Chief Minister of Tripura.” The same post has gone viral on Twitter. The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room ( AFWA) found that in the four-year-old video, PM Narendra Modi was referring to the then Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar and not Manik Saha. The viral posts are archived here, here, and here. AFWA probe We have found that Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a rally in Tripura’s Sonamura in February 2018 during the state assembly election, had targeted the then Chief Minister Manik Sarkar and said that people of the state did not deserve ‘Manik’ but a ‘HIRA’ i.e 'H'ighway, 'I'ways (digital connectivity), 'R'oadways and 'A'irways. This was reported in 2018 on multiple mainstream media. In the 2018 election, BJP toppled the Manik Sarkar-led Left government in Tripura and Biplab Kumar Deb assumed the office of the chief minister of the state. Biplab Kumar Deb resigned from the Chief Minister’s post recently -- just a year left before the assembly election. Manik Saha, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from the state and the state president of BJP has sworn-in as the new chief minister on May 15. Thus, a few netizens have mixed up the former CM Manik Sarkar with Manik Saha, the new CM of Tripura, while referring to an old clip of PM Modi’s speech. (With Inputs from Yash Mittal) INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Four years back PM Modi said that Tripura should get rid of Manik Saha. But now BJP has brought back the same Manik Saha. Conclusion Four years back in an election rally PM Modi had urged people to replace “Manik” with “Hira”.

            "[Evidences]:A video circulating online claims that the Supreme Court (SC) has ruled in favor of presidential aspirant Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. over a petition seeking to cancel his candidacy in next year’s election. This is not true. The petition filed with the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to cancel his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) has yet to reach the High Court as the poll body is only now preparing to hear the case. The petition was filed on Nov. 2 by human rights groups on the grounds of “false material representation” after the former senator declared his eligibility to run despite a 1995 tax evasion conviction. Neither retired SC senior associate justice Antonio Carpio nor Vice President Leni Robredo has anything to do with the petition, as falsely claimed in the erroneous video originally published on YouTube by Showbiz Fanaticz, which is behind a lot of disinformation previously fact-checked by VERA Files. Comelec Spokesperson James Jimenez told the media on Nov. 9 that the case had been raffled to the Commission’s 2nd Division. On Friday, he said the summons had been issued. The case will only reach the SC “if the Commission’s decision is brought by the aggrieved party to said Court” before the ruling becomes final and executory five days following its promulgation, as per Comelec’s Rules of Procedure. The supposed “official letter” from the High Court cited in Showbiz Fanaticz’ video was a copy of a June 1997 SC ruling affirming a 1994 Court of Appeals (CA) decision denying a petition by Marcos in connection with his family’s estate and income taxes. This 1997 SC decision is unrelated to the 1997 CA ruling which found the former senator “guilty beyond reasonable doubt” of violating Section 45 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) after failing to file income tax returns from 1982 to 1985. (See Final decision to bar Bongbong Marcos in 2022 nat’l elections due to tax evasion is on SC — Carpio) Marcos’ 1995 conviction is the basis of the petition calling for the cancellation of his COC. Petitioners pointed out that as per Section 253 of the now amended NIRC, any public officer or employee convicted of a crime under the tax code “shall be dismissed from the public service and perpetually disqualified from holding any public office.” But Marcos declared in his COC that he has never been found liable for an offense that imposed a penalty of “perpetual disqualification to hold public office.” Petitioners argue that this is a case of false material representation, and is a ground for the cancellation of COC under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code. On Nov. 4, Facebook page Duterte News Info uploaded the video from Showbiz Fanaticz’ YouTube channel that now has over 218,000 views. While on Duterte News Info’s FB page, the video has been viewed more than 633,000 times by netizens. It garnered 86,000 engagements and could have reached 3.7 million FB users, as per the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. Both Showbiz Fanaticz and Duterte News Info — created in November 2017 and December 2020, respectively — are notorious for spreading false and misleading information online.

            "[Evidences]:A Few social media posts with videos with the claims like Indian and Chinese army recent standoff, recent ceasefire violations at India, China border etc. are being widely shared. These posts can be seen here (archived), here (archived) and here (archived). Through this article let’s fact-check the claims made in these posts. Claim: Videos related to the recent Indian and Chinese troops standoff near Ladakh on the intervening night of 29/30 August 2020. Fact: The Government of India in a press note on 31 August 2020, mentioned about a fresh standoff between the Indian and Chinese soldiers on the intervening night of 29/30 August 2020. The videos shared on social media were found to be available at least a few months prior to this incident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. Video 1: Reverse image search of the screenshots of this video led us to a YouTube channel called ‘SDP ARMY MAN’ in which the same video was uploaded on 04 January 2020. Further reverse image search led us to a news channel report with these visuals dating back to 20 May 2020. The description of the video reads ‘Tensions escalate at India-China border’. With this, we can conclude that this video is at least months old. Video 2: Reverse image search of the screenshots of the video led us to a video of a news report about the ceasefire violations at the Line of Control near India-Pakistan border in Jammu & Kashmir. This news video had the same visuals as in the post. This news report dated back to 14 June 2020. The same video was uploaded on 15 April 2020 in a Facebook page called ‘IAF Guard’. With all these, we can conclude that this video is at least months old and not related to the latest standoff between Indian and Chinese army. Video 3: Reverse image search of the screenshots of the video led us to the same video which is posted on tumblr on 30 January 2020. We did not find any credible source to confirm that the soldiers seen in the video are Indian and that the video is from the Indo-China border. To sum it up, in the light of the latest standoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers near LAC, old videos like these are being circulated across social media platforms with misleading claims.

            "[Evidences]:In his 2021 Madaraka Day speech, president Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenya's gross domestic product at independence in 1963 was KSh6.4 billion. This is mostly correct. But his claim that this was increased to KSh4.5 trillion in the following 50 years is misleading. He claimed his administration had doubled the GDP achieved by \"the colonisers and the first three administrations\". This is also misleading. Two claims about the national government's allocations to Kenya's 47 counties are understated. And claims about issuing more title deeds to land, and improved renal health facilities, are mostly correct. With just over a year left in his presidency, Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta has been highlighting his administration's achievements since he took office in 2013. His second and final term is set to end in August 2022. A notable theme in his recent statements has been comparing his legacy with that of his predecessors. On 1 June 2021, in a speech marking 58 years of self rule on Kenya's Madaraka Day national holiday, Kenyatta drew attention to economic growth and improvements in healthcare, among other areas. We looked at seven claims in his speech . We have asked the presidency to comment on our findings. Kenyatta said that \"after 74 years of colonial occupation, that was what Kenya was worth every year\". Kenya became independent on 12 December 1963. A country's gross domestic product is an attempt to measure the size of its economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. For historical data on GDP, we consulted John Kinuthia , senior programmes officer at IBP Kenya , the Kenyan arm of the International Budget Partnership budget transparency think tank. He directed us to the World Bank 's data portal .  This is compiled from the national accounts of individual member countries. It shows that in 1963, Kenya's GDP was KSh6.6 billion in that year's prices, a measure known as current GDP. We therefore rate the president's claim as mostly correct. Kenyatta's three predecessors, including his father Jomo Kenyatta, were in office from independence in 1963 to 2013. We asked Benjamin Muchiri, who is in charge of national accounts at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , how GDP should be compared across several years. It was important to adjust for inflation, he said. \"When we are reporting GDP for 2020, it is based on 2020 prices, and 2019 GDP would be based on 2019 prices. When we say current GDP it means that at the respective year price,\" Muchiri said. He gave the example of a farmer selling 100 bags of maize at KSh3,000 this year. His output would be KSh300,000. Next year, if the farmer produced the same number of bags but sold each for KSh4,000, their output would be KSh400,000. \"In actual sense, your output has not changed,\" he said. \"It is the same 100 bags, but the prices have gone up. When you are doing constant GDP [on the other hand], it holds the prices constant. The only thing that changes is either the quantity or the quality.\" The World Bank also says that constant prices are adjusted for inflation and so measure true growth. Current prices aren't, and don't. In addition, how GDP is calculated has changed over time as the system of national accounts – internationally agreed standards for measuring economic activity – are reworked to cater for changes in the economy, Muchiri said. The key changes were in 1968, 1993 and 2008, when the current guidelines were established, he added. The World Bank data shows that Kenya's current price GDP grew from KSh6.6 billion in 1963 to KSh41 billion in 1978 when the senior Kenyatta died. In 2002, when Moi stepped down, it was KSh1.04 trillion, and KSh4.75 trillion in 2013, when Kibaki left office. But GDP for 1963 at constant prices comes to KSh371.9 billion. By the time Kenyatta took office in 2013, GDP when adjusted for inflation was KSh3.6 trillion. Kenya's GDP at start and end of presidential terms Year Current price GDP Constant price GDP 1963 KSh6.6 billion KSh371.9 billion 1978 KSh41 billion KSh998 billion 2002 KSh1.04 trillion KSh2.1 trillion 2013 KSh4.75 trillion KSh3.65 trillion The figures appear to swing wildly. This is to be expected. \"We must be very careful whenever we try to compare GDP across different years,\" Dr Abraham Rugo, the country manager of budget transparency think tank IBP Kenya, told Africa Check. In doing the maths, we have to consider inflation, currency valuation, population changes, technology and movements in the services sector across the years, he said. While Kenyatta's figure of KSh4.75 trillion for 2013 is accurate, it is not real growth. When adjusted for inflation, the actual GDP that year was about a quarter (23%) less. We therefore rate the president's claim as misleading. Kenyatta said the country's GDP was now KSh10.3 trillion. He gave 1885 as the year the country was colonised, making it 128 years from then until he took office in 2013. The most recent government data puts Kenya's GDP at KSh10.2 trillion in 2020. The World Bank's figure is slightly higher: KSh10.5 trillion in 2020. In 2013 GDP was KSh4.75 trillion, less than half of these figures. This seems to support Kenyatta's claim that GDP has doubled. But the claim faces the same comparison challenges discussed in the previous claim. The president's comparison was based on nominal, or current, values, John Mutua , the programmes coordinator at the Institute of Economic Affairs Kenya policy think tank, told Africa Check. But we can't directly compare GDP under Kenyatta with GDP under his predecessors, Mutua said. \"One has to factor inflation; there are issues of population growth and the likes. A comparison of just nominal figures is not accurate.\" The comparison also discounts the 2014 rebasing of GDP that, on paper, increased the size of the economy by 25%. (Read our analysis: The trouble with statistics in Africa .) GDP growth built from previous achievements A good indicator would be to use \"real\" GDP, which is adjusted for inflation, Mutua said. This was KSh5 trillion in 2019 according to data from Kenya's central bank . The most recent World Bank figure we found was also KSh5 trillion, but for 2020. The rise from KSh3.6 trillion, the real GDP in 2013, to KSh5 trillion in 2020 is not a doubling. On that score alone, the president is incorrect. Population size also matters when calculating GDP, IBP Kenya's Rugo told us. This is because household consumption is relevant. \"Does the government want to take credit for the annual rise in population numbers?\" he asked. Kenyatta's administration has invested heavily in major infrastructure such as rail , roads and energy , adding to the GDP, Rugo said. A lot of this is driven by debt, but does count when calculating GDP. Rugo also said that while Kenyatta's administration could lay claim to the infrastructure investments, a lot of the economic activity driving GDP growth today were put in place under his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki. \"GDP is incremental. You don't start from zero,\" he said. Kenya's constitution says the national government must share revenue with the country's 47 counties. It adds that this share must not be less than 15% of the last audited and approved national revenue. The counties also receive grants from the national government. Allocations to counties are set out in the law on division of revenue , which is approved every year. The table below shows the total allocation to counties since 2013. Allocation to Kenya's counties (2017 to 2020) Fiscal Year Amount (KSh billions) 2013/14 9.8 2013/14 210 2014/15 226.7 2015/16 287 2016/17 302.2 2017/18 345.7 2018/19 372.7 2019/20 378.5 2020/21 369.9 TOTAL 2,502.5 Source: Division of Revenue Acts The total is KSh2.5 trillion. The president understated it by KSh200 billion. Kenya's national treasury estimates GDP at the end of the 2019/20 financial year as KSh10.2 trillion , a\"preliminary actual\" figure. In his speech, the president said the most recent GDP figure was KSh10.3 trillion. From 2012/13 to 2020/21, county governments received a total of KSh2.5 trillion. This is equivalent to 24.5% of GDP, not 16.9% . On a \"pro-rata basis\", Kenyatta said , the 5.1 million title deeds to land issued under his administration were \"seven times what the previous administrations had done combined\". According to Kenya's lands ministry , the government has issued 5.1 million title deeds from 2013 to 2021. Six million were issued in the first 50 years of independence. In Kenyatta's first term, from 2013 to 2017, more than 3.21 million titles were issued, the ministry says . Over 1.26 million deeds were issued from 2018 to April 2020. Period Title deeds issued 2013 to 2017 3,218,170 2018 to April 2020 1,269,396 Total (2013 to April 2020) 4,487,566 Source: Ministry of Land and Physical Planning Africa Check previously asked the lands minister for data on title deeds issued since April 2020, but has not yet received a response. Based on the available data above, Kenyatta's claim that his administration has issued 5.1 million title deeds in seven years is mostly correct. This improved health infrastructure was an increase from only six renal units established under his three predecessors, Kenyatta said . Enquiries with the Renal Patients Society of Kenya and the Kenya Renal Association brought us to McDonald Ogutu, a researcher at the association. Ogutu told Africa Check that the association's database showed \"there are 212 renal units in Kenya at the moment, with 54 of them in public hospitals, while 158 are in private and faith based hospitals\". In March 2016, the health ministry reported that the president had pledged to distribute 289 dialysis machines to go with the 44 in place. The figure is in the president's state of the nation address of that year. A September 2020 senate report records that 305 additional dialysis machines were installed in 54 public health facilities during Kenyatta's tenure. Added to the 44, it brings the number to 349. We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct.\n",

            "[Evidences]:More than two decades after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, conspiracy theorists are claiming there is new footage of that day’s attack on the Pentagon. An Instagram reel, shared Sept. 12, shows a grainy video under bold text that reads, \"9/11’s HIDDEN FOOTAGE MISSILE HITTING PENTAGON.\" The low-quality video replays a short clip of a blurry white object moving toward the Pentagon, but the clip loops to the beginning before any explosion. The post’s caption said, \"newly released footage of a camera overlooking the Pentagon appears to show none other than a SCUD Missile hitting the Pentagon.\" (Scud missiles are tactical ballistic missiles developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.) The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) There is overwhelming evidence that a hijacked airplane struck the Pentagon on 9/11, not a missile. The 9/11 Commission report explains in detail what happened the day of the attacks. After American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked and redirected toward the Pentagon, around 9:38 a.m. that day, it crashed into the building at 530 miles per hour, killing all 64 people onboard and 125 people in the Pentagon. Pentagon security footage shows a white object, the plane, flying into the building before exploding upon impact. This footage was released in 2006 as a result of a public records request filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch. FBI photos of the attack’s aftermath also show debris from the airplane. Images from the Navy Archives similarly show pieces of the plane on the ground outside the Pentagon. The Pentagon has memorialized those killed at the site. The flight victims included sisters Zoe and Dana Falkenberg, ages 3 and 8, of Maryland, who were on a trip with their parents to Australia; American Airlines employee Mary Jane Booth, 64, of Virginia, who was flying to Las Vegas for a meeting of the employees’ credit union; and U.S. Navy Capt. John D. Yamnicky, 71, of Maryland, who was headed to California to work on a missile program. We rate the claim that a video shows a missile hitting the Pentagon on 9/11 Pants on Fire!\n",

Several posts on social media claim that governments, health organizations, philanthropists, and others involved in the COVID-19 vaccination programs violate all 10 rules of the Nuremberg code. The Code relates to the atrocities carried out in Europe under Nazi rule in 1930s and 40s. Nuremberg bears no relation or relevance to COVID-19 vaccines. The Nuremberg Code is a set of principles aimed to protect human life, specifically stating that all participants must voluntarily consent to medical trials. The code was established shortly after the Second World War, when Nazi medics carried out inhumane medical experiments with the aim of promoting \"racial purity.\" The viral post refers to principles outlined by UNESCO and refers to Article 6, which relates to informed consent. However, a paper published in 2005 outlines that informed consent and vaccination are compatible, especially when individuals risk transmitting the illness. It further claims that those authorities will be punished for enforcing laws related to vaccines. Currently, there are no instances or calls for compulsory vaccination. In the U.S., children wishing to attend school and those who opt for permanent residency have been told they must get vaccinated. However, the legislation allows exemptions for medical reasons. Pfizer and AstraZeneca re among the vaccines to have undergone extensive clinical trials before gaining the necessary regulatory approval for mass production. They are now used globally. The FDA oversees the safety and efficacy of all vaccines. The CDC monitors the process of immunization in its entirety, and all adverse events are documented. We mark the claim as false as the Nuremberg Code has nothing to do with current medicinal practices.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"A million people … could get health insurance right away\" if Texas expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Visiting Dallas on Nov. 6, 2013, President Barack Obama sought to allay worries about his signature health-care law and assert Texans’ need for more health coverage. Texas could have helped many immediately, he said, by accepting the law’s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid, a key Obamacare initiative. \"Across this state, you've got a million people -- because this is a big state -- a million people, citizens, who don’t have health insurance that could get health insurance right away if the state of Texas decided to take advantage of it,\" Obama said at Temple Emanu-El to volunteers who helped people enroll via the act’s insurance marketplace on Healthcare.gov. Texas consistently has the nation’s highest percentage of residents without health insurance. The Census Bureau estimated 6.4 million Texans in 2012 had no health coverage. The state Health and Human Services Commission estimated that in January 2013, Texas had about 1 million adults on Medicaid. Under the health care law, the federal government offered to pay expansion costs during the first three years for states that extended Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Texas Gov. Rick Perry rejected that deal July 19, 2012. Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the state commission, which administers Medicaid in Texas, told us by email, \"We estimate that almost 1.4 million Texans would become eligible for Medicaid if the state opted to expand.\" The Urban Institute, a non-partisan research institute in Washington, D.C., reached a slightly larger figure in a July 2012 report that said, \"State decisions regarding whether to expand Medicaid under the ACA will directly affect the 15.1 million uninsured adults with incomes below 138 percent of FPL (federal poverty level) who are not currently eligible for Medicaid. Of these newly eligible uninsured adults ... 1.7 million live in Texas.\" The institute said its estimates were made using data from the Census Bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey. In a March 18, 2013, report, the state agency contrasted how Texas’ uninsured population might differ in two different Obamacare scenarios using Current Population Survey census data from March 2012. \"Current state\" populations included 19.5 million insured and 6 million uninsured (24 percent uninsured), the report said. The implementation of Obamacare alone, without Medicaid expansion in Texas, would shift that rate to 16 percent uninsured (4.2 million Texans), the agency estimated. Under Obamacare implementation with full Medicaid expansion, 12 percent (3.1 million Texans) would remain uninsured. Not all the newly eligible adults would be expected to sign up immediately, Goodman said, citing 2012 estimates from the agency that show Medicaid adult enrollment rising by 341,000 in 2014, by 776,000 in 2015 and by just over 1 million in 2016: Our ruling Obama said, \"A million people … could get health insurance right away\" if Texas expanded Medicaid as encouraged by the Obamacare law. Estimates show some 1.4 million to 1.7 million would be eligible immediately. We rate his statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

            "[Evidences]:Texas is a bastion of opportunity that attracts newcomers, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in his Jan. 18 inaugural address. \"Last year, out of the 500,000 (in) population growth we had in the state of Texas, about 250,000 of the 500,000 came to Texas, voted for Texas, with their feet,\" Dewhurst said. \"They came from the other 49 states--and it wasn’t because of our weather.\"That was more dramatic than his prepared remarks, which read: \"Last year, more than 200,000 people moved to Texas from the other 49 states.\"Either way, that’s a lot of volunteer Texans.We zeroed in on what Dewhurst actually speechified. Asked for back-up information, Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz pointed us to the state demographer, Lloyd Potter of San Antonio.Potter said there are no published figures yet on the state’s population gains in 2010 due to migration from other states. However, Potter singled out a U.S. Census Bureau estimate covering July 2008-July 2009, which says the population of Texas increased by 478,012, or 2 percent, to 24.8 million over those 12 months. During the period, net migration from other states--the number of people who moved to Texas minus those who left Texas for other states--was 143,423. The net migration of residents who moved to Texas from outside the U.S. was 88,116.That is, the state’s population increased by nearly 480,000 with the 143,423 new residents hailing from other states accounting for about 30 percent of the increase.At the bureau, Dallas spokeswoman Suzee Privett guided us to a different collection of data estimating new Texans. According to the bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, Texas enjoyed a net gain of 128,137 residents coming from other states in 2009.Robert Bernstein, a Maryland-based bureau spokesman, said the two census estimates differ because they cover different time periods--July 2008-July 2009 compared to calendar year 2009--and use different data-gathering approaches. The former estimate draws on government records including birth and death certificates, he said, while the survey is based on samplings of households across the country.Potter said it’s possible that Dewhurst’s reference to 250,000 people moving here from other states included those from other countries, which is a common misunderstanding.We shared the 2009 estimates with Walz. He replied by e-mail that Dewhurst was trying to show that roughly half of the state’s population growth is from migration, with the other half due to natural increases, in-state births minus deaths.But we’re left weighing what Dewhurst actually said: that half the growth Texas experienced -- 250,000 out of 500,000 additional residents last year, he said -- was due to residents moving in from other states.Not quite. First, the census data for 2010 hasn’t been released yet. And the most generous census estimate prior to last year indicates net migration from other states equaled 143,000 people from July 2008 to July 2009, accounting for less than a third of the state’s population increase in the period.However, looking at Texas population growth in terms of people moving here \"with their feet\" versus people born here, Dewhurst pegged the ratio correctly -- about half-and-half.We rate his claim Half True.\n",

Chris Christie said his self-proclaimed \"Jersey Comeback\" continues to gain momentum, despite a rising unemployment rate.At a July 23 news conference in Trenton, Christie said he would like to see the unemployment rate -- which jumped to 9.6 percent in June from 9.2 percent in May -- drop, but cited other labor statistics to show a more optimistic picture of the state’s employment market.\"By the way, the numbers indicate that the comeback is still very strong -- 9,900 new jobs last month. We created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000,\" Christie said.Is job growth as vibrant as the governor claims? In this fact-check, we are strictly examining whether the numbers are correct, not whether Christie's policies deserve credit for them. We found Christie’s numbers are on target. In June, the state added 9,900 jobs overall, including private-sector and public-sector employment. Adding that to the jobs gained since the beginning of the year puts 2012’s total so far at 39,600 jobs overall, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Last year the state gained 31,100 jobs.So the first six months of job gains in 2012 have already outpaced job growth in 2011 by 8,500 jobs, supporting the governor’s point.Christie also said \"2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000.\"That is accurate as well.New Jersey added 33,400 private-sector jobs in 2011. The year before that, the state gained 10,200 jobs. And in 2008 and 2009 -- in the peak of the recession -- the state lost 224,900 private-sector jobs in total.Over the last decade, New Jersey only experienced better job growth in 2000 than it did in 2011. In 2000, the state added 64,500 private-sector jobs.Our rulingChristie said that \"we created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000.\"So far this year New Jersey added 39, 600 jobs in total. That’s 8,500 more jobs than the state gained in all of 2011.And in 2011, the state added more private-sector jobs than any year since 2000.The governor earns a True on this claim.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while launching multiple development projects in Varanasi on July 15, 2021, claimed that Uttar Pradesh had 12 medical colleges till four years ago or before the current BJP government came in to power in the state. He also said that this number has increased four-fold now. \"Today, UP is witnessing unprecedented improvement in medical infrastructure, be it village health centres, medical colleges or AIIMS. Till 4 years ago, where there used to be a dozen medical colleges in UP, their number has now increased almost 4 times. Many medical colleges are in different stages of construction,\" said Modi at the inaugural ceremony of projects worth around Rs 744 crore, including nine medical colleges. He also inaugurated many public projects and works, including a 100-bed maternal child health wing in Banaras Hindu University, multi-level parking at Godauliya, Ro-Ro Vessels for tourism development on River Ganga and three-lane flyover bridge on the Varanasi Ghazipur Highway. Key development projects in #Varanasi include multi-level parking at Godaulia, Ro-Ro Vessels for tourism development and three-lane flyover bridge on the Varanasi-Ghazipur Highway. Watch this short film for more details🔽 pic.twitter.com/ZWcKV34fdt — PIB India (@PIB_India) July 15, 2021 But Modi is not the first one to make such a claim. This statement has been made by several officials in the UP government during past few months and has been published as facts. Around 10 days before this statement, the Times of India had written about the inauguration of nine medical colleges in the state and how that would take the count to 48. In the article, a spokesperson is quoted as saying, \"There were just 12 medical colleges in UP till March 2017. But the BJP government announced to raise more medical colleges and ensure that people of the state do not have to travel to other states for treatment.\" In another TOI article dated March 18, 2021, \"officials\" are said to have made the same claim. In fact, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath too made the same claim while addressing an investment and tourism event organised under the banner of Uttar Pradesh Association of North America in December 2020. In a PTI article, he is quoted as saying that till 2017, UP had just 12 medical colleges, 30 more are now being constructed and the government plans to have one in each of the 75 districts. But this claim, although made several times, is incorrect. FactChecker looked at responses given in the Lok Sabha, Press Information Bureau releases and records kept by UP's Directorate of Medical Education and Training. Although all official documents don't have the same numbers, still none show the numbers claimed above. Fact-checking Claim Part 1: 12 colleges till March 2017 Three official documents prove this claim to be untrue. Firstly, according to a July 2018 document filed under the Reference Division of Parliamentary Library on the 'Status of Medical Education in India', Uttar Pradesh had 45 medical colleges for the academic year 2016-17. Of these, 16 were government colleges and 29 private. Secondly, in a response given in the Lok Sabha on July 22, 2016, the then Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Faggan Singh Kulaste gave a state-wise list of medical colleges in the country. The list shows that of the 439 medical colleges in the country, Uttar Pradesh had 38. Lastly, the records of UP's Directorate of Medical Education and Training, which controls medical colleges and attached teaching hospitals, list government and private medical colleges with their year of establishment. According to these lists, the state had 41 government medical colleges and 24 private medical colleges till 2017. Also, it shows that while no private college has been established in the state since then, seven government colleges have been setup in 2019. Fact-checking Claim Part 2: UP got 36 medical colleges in 4 years Modi and Adityanath claimed that Uttar Pradesh now has 48 medical colleges, of which only 12 existed before the current BJP government came into power. This means the Adityanath-led government made at least 36 medical colleges. But, according to two responses given in the Lok Sabha in February 2021 by Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Uttar Pradesh has 57 medical colleges and only 12 of them were established between 2018 and 2020 (9 government and 3 private). This doesn't include the nine medical colleges PM Modi inaugurated on July 15, 2021, which takes the number to 21 and not 36. When the same data is presented based on academic year, it can be seen that between academic years 2017-18 and 2019-20, 10 medical colleges were established in the state. Also, the statements made give no clarity on what setting up or establishing these colleges means. So, FactChecker looked at how many colleges have got approval from the Medical Council of India in recent years. In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on September 15, 2020, Choubey gave a list of medical colleges recognised by the MCI or the central government during the last three years. This list includes only six medical colleges from Uttar Pradesh. The MCI was replaced by the National Medical Commission (NMC) in 2020 with an aim to overhaul the medical education regulation system. Although data from all sources is different owing to the time they were collected, but none is even close to the numbers PM Modi and UP CM Adityanath have quoted. FactChecker tried contacting both for a comment via email and calls to their offices but neither had responded by the time this article was published. If and when we do receive a response, we'll update the story.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The claim was shared here on Facebook on May 7, 2021 alongside an image that appears to show an asteroid hovering near Earth. Thai-language text overlaid below the photo translates as: “Nuclear bomb can’t stop! “NASA warned an asteroid will hit the Earth in six months, nuclear bomb wouldn’t be able to stop it.” Other posts with a similar claim have been shared here and here on Facebook and here on a public forum. The claim is false: the posts have misrepresented a NASA simulation exercise as real. AFP found the image was originally published by the Thai news organisation The States Times here on Facebook on May 6, 2021. The States Times cites information from this report published by British tabloid The Daily Mail on May 3, 2021 . The Daily Mail report reads in part: “Mission IMPOSSIBLE: NASA warns even a nuclear bomb wouldn't stop a giant asteroid heading for Earth after massive six month simulation exercise ends in devastating impact. “In a simulated exercise, US and European scientists were told they had six months to come up with a lifesaving plan to stop a massive rock smashing into Earth that had been spotted 35 million miles away.” Fictitious asteroid A NASA spokeswoman confirmed the purported asteroid is not real. “The social media post appears to misinterpret the hypothetical asteroid impact simulation, which occurred during the 7th International Academy of Aeronautics Planetary Defense Conference,” NASA spokeswoman Karen Fox told AFP. “This exercise was purely a simulation and involved a fictitious asteroid named 2021PDC. This asteroid does not exist, and as such is not a threat to Earth.” The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA-funded research and development lab, released a statement titled “The 2021 PDC Hypothetical Asteroid Impact Scenario” stating that the scenario is “completely fictional” and “does not describe an actual potential asteroid impact”. According to the statement, NASA created a scenario where an asteroid called “2021 PDC” could potentially impact the earth in six months’ time. NASA said that there are no known asteroids that pose a significant risk of impact with Earth over the next 100 years.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A very well known supermarket in France reinstated cash payments after a protest involving 50 people against card-only payments.\n",
            "[Evidences]:A post shared more than 14,000 times on Facebook details a vague anecdote about a protest against a cashless policy at a \"very well known supermarket\" in France that led to the retailer reinstating cash. The same post has also been shared thousands of times on X (formerly known as Twitter). Despite this, there's no evidence that the protest recounted in the post ever took place. All businesses in France must accept cash by law, apart from in a few very limited circumstances such as if the notes are in a poor condition or the customer attempts to pay in a different currency. Claims surrounding cashless payments , a central banking system and digital currency are extremely popular on social media and we have fact checked them many times before. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What does the post say? The post, which features a screenshot of a Facebook message or status, says: \"In France for three months now...Their approach to digital banking is simply fantastic. I'd like to share a bit about it. \"A very well known supermarket here decided to go cashless. \"A group of 50 people got together and agreed that they would all do a big shop on the same day. Pilling their trolleys to the brim and each person getting to the checkout - the human check out, not the machines - and having everything scanned before bringing cash out. \"The staff were absolutely overrun. There management in a complete tizz, everyone repeatedly, calmly and in a very organised and polite fashion acting as if they knew nothing. No edges, no rudeness, no humiliation. \"Offering No other method of payment than cash, willing to leave their trolleys behind if cash was not accepted... \"The supermarket reinstated cash.\" The post later adds: \"They are doing it in every single area of France. Simply refusing to be part of it.\" Businesses in France are obliged to take cash It is illegal not to accept cash in France —in shops but also in all other businesses, such as the petrol stations and restaurants which are referenced in another part of the same post. The law says : \"Refusing to accept banknotes and coins that have legal tender in France at the value at which they are in circulation is punishable by a fine applicable to class two offences.\" Banknotes and coins can only be refused in very limited circumstances , such as if foreign currency is used, if the coins or notes are in poor condition, if the currency is detected as counterfeit and if the payment consists of more than 50 coins. Cash may also be refused for security or technical reasons, for example by a shopkeeper on a nightshift, or at parking meters to deter vandalism. Because of this, it's unlikely that a \"very well known supermarket\" in the country would decide to go totally cashless. No evidence any such protest has taken place Full Fact could find no information online about any protest like the one described in the Facebook post. While we were unable to find accounts that matched the social media protest, some large supermarket chains in the country have hit headlines in recent years after using a loophole in French law to keep stores open on Sunday afternoons. French labour laws state that employees of large supermarkets can't work past 1pm on Sunday. To avoid having to close the stores these supermarkets have sent cashiers home and kept self-scanning options only, an approach that has resulted in some protests from people who fear such a move could put jobs at risk. In 2022 Banque de France reminded two of France's biggest retailers that they were obliged to accept cash, after the introduction of self-scanning options (which do not accept banknotes or cards) only on Sundays meant that customers had to pay by card. Christophe Baud-Berthier, a director at Banque de France was quoted in French media saying : \"This is the principle and it must be remembered: a merchant cannot refuse a cash payment.\" Image courtesy of Tara Clark\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Facebook posts that list more than 30 reasons in the world economy as to \"why Ukraine matters\" contain accurate data.\n",
            "[Evidences]:On Jan. 3, 2022, a Facebook user posted more than 30 purported reasons as to why Ukraine matters. It was copied and pasted many times on social media in what’s known as copypasta. The data from the posts also showed up on the AndesiteBlue website and in Twitter threads. We found a similar post on LinkedIn from January 2021 titled: “Ukraine’s positions in Europe and the world.” It was credited to Mykola Siutkin. That indicated to us early on that some of the data were perhaps outdated when it went viral in 2022. The more recent social media posts came at a time when hundreds of thousands of Russian troops were on the brink of invading Ukraine. The signs of a potential conflict led to NATO allies telling their citizens to leave the country. The situation also escalated warnings of “devastating economic and trade sanctions” for Russia. Some readers may have seen that The New York Times published a story on Feb. 19 with the headline, “Why Ukraine Matters: What to Know About the Crisis With Russia.” However, that article appeared to have a very different focus than the social media claims. For this story, we will look at the truthfulness of the more than 30 individual claims that were listed in the viral Facebook posts. One of the many Facebook posts with the copied-and-pasted text read as follows: Why does the Ukraine matter? Just a little info on the natural resources, economy, geographic location, and size of why it’s important to Europe and the global supply chain. How the nation of Ukraine ranks: Ukraine is an agricultural country: Ukraine is an industrialized country: https://ukrainainc.net/2022/01/28/ukraine-ranks/ The link at the end of the post appeared to perhaps go to a source for the information. However, it simply led to a website that cited the original Jan. 3 Facebook post. The viral posts were broken out into three sections: Ukraine’s ranking in the world for key natural resources, for agriculture, and for industry. We’ll look at each individual claim, one by one. Data vary based on the year gathered, so we looked for the most recent reports available for each category. ✅ True. “1st in Europe in proven recoverable reserves of uranium ores.” Data from 2018 that were published in 2020 showed that Ukraine was seventh in the world for recoverable reserves of uranium ores and in first place for Europe. (Source: Statista.com) ✅ True. “2nd place in Europe and 10th place in the world in terms of titanium ore reserves.” According to information from 2021, Norway was the only European country with more titanium ore reserves. (Source: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Page T11, Exhibit C) ✅ True. “2nd place in the world in terms of explored reserves of manganese ores (2.3 billion tons, or 12% of the world’s reserves).” The website ukrainetrek.com backs up this data. (Sources: ukrainetrek.com and USGS) ✅ True. “2nd largest iron ore reserves in the world (30 billion tons).” Data published in 2010 showed that Ukraine was only topped by China in this category. It’s unclear if more recent numbers changed those rankings. (Source: USGS) ✅ True. “2nd place in Europe in terms of mercury ore reserves.” As of 2010, Spain was the only European country that had more mercury ore reserves. (Source: USGS) ✅ True. “3rd place in Europe (13th place in the world) in shale gas reserves (22 trillion cubic meters).” This was correct with the context that it appeared the “22 trillion cubic meters” number was a typo. According to Reuters in 2012, the number was 42 trillion cubic meters. (Source: Reuters) ❌ False. “4th in the world by the total value of natural resources.” We were unable to find any data to corroborate this statistic. According to theglobaleconomy.com, in 2019, Ukraine ranked 78th in the world for “income from natural resources” in “percent of GDP.” In 2021, Investopedia also published a list of the countries with the most natural resources. Ukraine did not make the top 10. (Sources: theglobaleconomy.com and Investopedia) ? Outdated. “7th place in the world in coal reserves (33.9 billion tons).” While this was true according to data from 2016, updated numbers from 2019 showed that Ukraine fell one spot to eighth place. (Source: BP) ✅ True. “1st in Europe in terms of arable land area.” According to the CIA’s World Factbook, 56.1% of Ukraine’s land is arable. Arable land is defined by Merriam-Webster as land being “fit for or used for the growing of crops.” (Source: CIA) ✅ Mostly True. “3rd place in the world by the area of black soil (25% of world’s volume).” While we did not find data that matched these exact numbers, the point being made here was that black soil was abundant in Ukraine. In 2014, the FAO Investment Centre published a report on worldbank.org that mentioned more data: Ukraine is renowned as the breadbasket of Europe thanks to its black soils (“Chernozem” black because of the high organic matter content) which offer exceptional agronomic conditions. One-third of the worldwide stock of the fertile black soils, which cover more than half of Ukraine’s arable land, a large variety of climatic zones, and favourable temperature and moisture regimes, offers attractive conditions for the production of a large range of crops including cereals and oilseeds. Ukraine’s proximity to large and growing neighbouring markets – the Russian Federation and the European Union – and access to deep sea ports at the Black Sea, provide direct access to world markets, especially large grain importers in the Middle East and North Africa. (Source: worldbank.org) ✅ True. “1st place in the world in exports of sunflower and sunflower oil.” This data came from 2019. (Source: The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC)) ? Outdated. “2nd place in the world in barley production and 4th place in barley exports.” According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, (USDA), the barley production figure was outdated. As of 2021-2022, Ukraine was fourth in barley production. Meanwhile, as of 2020, data for barley exports did show Ukraine in fourth place. Both sets of data came from several years in the past, but since that time the country happened to not move out of its fourth place standing for barley exports. (Source: USDA and worldstopexports.com) ? Outdated. “3rd largest producer and 4th largest exporter of corn in the world.” According to data from 2019-2020, Ukraine is the fifth-largest corn producer in the world and the fourth-largest exporter. The data in the “why Ukraine matters” social media posts looked to be outdated, even though the corn export placement was still the same. (Sources: Investopedia and worldstopexports.com) ? Outdated. “4th largest producer of potatoes in the world.” While outdated, this was still a positive category for the country. Ukraine was third place in potato production, according to the most recent data that came from 2019. (Source: FAO Investment Centre) ? Outdated. “5th largest rye producer in the world.” This was another case where the data were outdated, but the recent numbers were more positive for Ukraine. The 2019-2020 growing season showed that the country was the fourth-largest producer of rye in the world. (Source: Statista.com) ✅ True. “5th place in the world in bee production (75,000 tons).” The website NationMaster.com showed that this was true. (Source: NationMaster.com) ? Outdated. “8th place in the world in wheat exports.” We’re not sure what year the data were collected, but we found in 2020 that Ukraine ranked fifth worldwide in wheat exports, higher than the viral Facebook posts claimed. The figure in the viral “why Ukraine matters” posts was outdated, but the more recent numbers were even more positive for the country. (Source: worldstopexports.com) ? Outdated. “9th place in the world in the production of chicken eggs.” According to data from 2020, the most recent we could locate, Ukraine wasn’t in the top 10 for egg production by country. The ninth place figure appeared to come from older reports. Further, the country had a “crisis” over issues with egg production in 2021, meaning that it did not have as strong of a standing in this category. (Sources: Statista.com and PoultryWorld.net) ❌ False. “16th place in the world in cheese exports.” Data compiled in 2020, which was the most recent year available, showed that Ukraine ranked 50th in cheese exports by country, not 16th. In that year, the country produced $24,319,000 worth of cheese exports, a decline of 9.2% from the previous year. We also looked at data from 2018 and found that Ukraine wasn’t in the top 25 that year either. (Source: World’s Top Exports) ✅ True. “Ukraine can meet the food needs of 600 million people.” This statistic appeared to come from Kyiv Post. (Source: Kyiv Post) ❌ False. “1st in Europe in ammonia production.” Data published in 2020, the most recent numbers available, showed that Germany, Netherlands, and Spain all had more ammonia production than Ukraine. We were unable to find figures from a previous year that showed Ukraine to be in first place in Europe for this category. (Source: Statista.com) ✅ True. “2nd in Europe and 4th largest natural gas pipeline system in the world (142.5 bln cubic meters of gas throughput capacity in the EU).” A 2007 report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said: “Roughly 20% of Europe’s gas passes through Ukraine and the country has the third-largest gas production and the fourth-largest gas market in Europe.” As for the number included in the parentheses, we found that it had been published by TASS, the Russian News Agency. (Oxford Institute and TASS) ? Outdated. “3rd largest in Europe and 8th largest in the world in terms of installed capacity of nuclear power plants.” This data appeared to be outdated, but more recent numbers were more positive for the country. In 2020, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Ukraine had advanced to second place in Europe and seventh place in the world for the installed capacity of nuclear power plants. (Source: IAEA) ? Outdated. “3rd place in Europe and 11th in the world in terms of rail network length (21,700 km).” This appeared to be outdated. The most recent cited data that we could find was from 2014. It showed Ukraine in fourth place in Europe and thirteenth in the world for rail network length. The length number that was included was 22,300 km, which was more than what was shown in the “why Ukraine matters” Facebook posts. (Source: NationMaster.com) ❓ Unproven. “3rd place in the world (after the U.S. and France) in production of locators and locating equipment.” We were unable to find reliable data for this specific category. ? Outdated. “3rd largest iron exporter in the world.” This data likely came from several years back. The most recent data that we could find was from 2020. It showed that Ukraine was in 5th place for iron exports. (Source: Statista.com) ❓ Unproven. “4th largest exporter of turbines for nuclear power plants in the world.” We were unable to find reliable data for this specific category. ❓ Unproven. “World’s 4th largest manufacturer of rocket launchers.” It’s unclear if this category meant all kinds of rocket-firing equipment or only a portion of the weaponry. Either way, we were unable to find reliable data. It’s true that Ukraine does manufacture rocket launching equipment, but data based on country rankings of manufactured units did not appear to be available. ? Outdated. “4th place in the world in clay exports.” This data appeared to be outdated, but still positive for the country. Figures from 2019 showed that Ukraine had advanced to third place in the world for clay exports. (Source: OEC) ? Outdated. “4th place in the world in titanium exports.” This data came from 2018. By 2019, Ukraine had fallen one spot to fifth place in the world for titanium exports. (Sources: World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) and OEC) ❓ Unproven. “8th place in the world in exports of ores and concentrates.”There’s no question that Ukraine’s overall ore exports placed the country as one of the leaders in the world, as numbers from the International Trade Centre (ITC) showed. However, we were unable to find any data that said Ukraine was in eighth place for “exports of ores and concentrates.” The closest we could find was a source that said Ukraine was in ninth place worldwide for exports of “ores, slag, and ash.” (Source: ITC) ? Outdated. “9th place in the world in exports of defence industry products.” This data appeared to be outdated. A source put Ukraine in twelfth place for “market share of the leading exporters of major weapons between 2016 and 2020, by country.” (Source: Statista.com) ? Outdated. “10th largest steel producer in the world (32.4 million tons).” Ukraine was the 10th largest producer of steel in 2016. However, the most recent data from 2020 showed that the country fell two spots to twelfth place. (Source: Wikipedia and World Steel Association) Much of the data included in the viral “why Ukraine matters” posts were true. Some of the items on the list had become outdated, but more recent numbers still showed that the country had a strong standing in various categories of reserves, production, and exports. However, we were unable to find figures to confirm a few of the claims, and a small number of them were flat-out false. For all of these reasons, the social media posts were neither definitively true, false, outdated, nor unproven, but rather a mixture of all four. That’s why we chose the rating of “Mixture.” Curious about how Snopes’ writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption?

            "claim [Claim]: \"Since President Obama took office, our federal spending has increased by nearly 30 percent and our national debt has increased by almost 50 percent.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:With an uncontested primary victory under his belt, freshman Wadsworth GOP Rep. Jim Renacci is gearing up for a hotly contested general election battle with Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton. The incumbents were placed in the same district by a GOP-controlled state legislature, which had to eliminate two of Ohio’s current 18 congressional seats because the state’s population has grown more slowly than other parts of the country.In an April 5 campaign email that sought volunteers and donations, Renacci touted his experience as a Northeast Ohio CPA and former small business owner in warning that \"Washington’s debt crisis threatens the prosperity of every American.\"\"Since President Obama took office, our federal spending has increased by nearly 30 percent and our national debt has increased by almost 50 percent,\" it continued. \"The time to stand up and say enough is enough is now!\"The kind of spending Renacci cited sounded excessive over a bit more than three years, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to audit his numbers.According to the U.S. Treasury Department’s website, on Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009 inauguration date, the total outstanding public debt was $10.627 trillion. By the time of Renacci’s April 5 missive, the total outstanding public debt had risen to $15.620 trillion. That’s almost 47 percent higher than it was the day Obama took office, a number that approximates the \"almost 50 percent\" statistic cited by Renacci.It’s worth noting that public debt began to escalate well before Obama’s presidency. On the inauguration date of his GOP predecessor, George W. Bush, total outstanding public debt was $5.728 trillion. On April 5 of Bush’s fourth year in office, public debt had swelled by approximately 25 percent to $7.142 trillion. When Bush left office, the debt was 85 percent higher than when he entered.Unsurprisingly, Obama’s Treasury Department blames most of the current debt on decisions made under Bush, including tax cuts (which it says cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion). It attributes a 12 percent fraction of the deficit to Obama administration policies like the $800 billion recovery act. Treasury Department spokesman Matthew Anderson says the recession further threw the budget out of whack by boosting the need for government aid at a time when tax revenues decreased.Renacci also stated that federal spending escalated by nearly 30 percent since Obama took office. When we asked his spokesman, James Slepian, where Renacci got the number, he correctly said that federal spending in the last year of Bush’s presidency was $2.982 trillion. He then said that spending would rise by $820 billion, or 27 percent, if President Obama’s $3.803 trillion proposed 2013 budget were to become law.When we observed that Obama’s proposal is unlikely to become law, and asked whether it’s appropriate to treat that number as dollars that have already been spent, Slepian replied that Obama’s budget reflects the president’s desired spending level. He also conceded it might have been more precise if Renacci had said \"Since President Obama took office, his budgets would increase federal spending by nearly 30 percent.\"Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman provided a more accurate take on the rise in federal spending in a statement that PolitiFact Ohio examined in January. PolitiFact found that Portman’s assertion that federal spending rose 21 percent over the past three years was Mostly True, because his percentage was accurate, but his statement didn’t reflect that the extra spending was a temporary elevation driven by the economic downturn.Renacci’s statement that the national debt has increased by almost 50 percent on Obama’s watch is accurate, although it fails to account for factors beyond Obama’s control that drove a significant part of the rise. And while federal spending has increased significantly on Obama’s watch, it hasn’t risen by \"nearly 30 percent,\" as Renacci claimed. Nor does Renacci’s statement reflect that plenty of the spending he criticizes is tied to the faltering economy and some was due to decisions made before Obama took office.On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Vice President Joe Biden went on the Today show on April 30, 2009, to quell concern about swine flu. But he didn't quite stay on message. Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began. \"We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move,\" Biden told Lauer. Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, \"Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ...\" — Biden laughs here — \"No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?\" Biden: \"I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing.\" That ended Lauer's flu questions. (His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to People magazine's list of most beautiful people.) Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement: \"On the Today Show this morning the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick.\" We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. \"Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,\" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. \"The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.\" We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze \"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\" Overfelt said. \"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\" \"Quite a bit of research indicates that,\" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: • A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to \"a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.\" • A 2003 study in the New England Journal of Medicine on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were \"clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft.\" • A 2005 study in The Lancet concluded, \"The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.\" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to — you guessed it — rubbing your eyes. \"If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,\" Overfelt said. \"With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane.\" If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was \"When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.\" That's just wrong. And he made the statement in the context of a highly sensitive public health matter where it's important to give the public accurate information. For fanning the flames of fear without having the facts on his side, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In a Feb. 8, 2011, speech at Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, Vice President Joe Biden -- who as a U.S. senator commuted almost daily to and from his home in Delaware using Amtrak -- touted rail as an integral part of the nation’s transportation future.During his address, he made a striking comment: \"If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic.\" (It wasn’t the first time he made the comparison; he also included in an article he wrote for Amtrak’s Arrive magazine.)For readers who hail from outside the northeastern U.S., we should explain what the Northeast Corridor is. Though definitions vary, the one we’ll use is the passenger rail line Amtrak uses from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with stops in such major cities as Baltimore; Wilmington, Del.; Philadelphia and New York. It is heavily trafficked by commuters and inter-city travelers -- more than 10 million riders in 2010.Interstate 95 runs from Maine to Florida. The relevant portion for Biden’s comment is the stretch that mirrors the Northeast Corridor, running from Washington north to Boston.When we asked Biden’s office to back up the claim, they said that the numbers came from the Transportation Department. Specifically, Biden’s office said, 5 billion passenger miles are traveled in the Northeast Corridor every day by rail, including both intercity rail and commuter rail, with an additional 14.5 billion vehicle miles traveled on I-95 between Washington, D.C., and New York City. Using these numbers, Biden’s office said, eliminating all trips by rail could increase volume on I-95 by 23 percent.Biden's office added that the claim factors in population growth over the next 40 years, which is projected to increase volume on I-95 by 80 percent. So the combination of eliminating rail and accommodating future growth would result in roughly a doubling of demand on I-95. Accommodating that demand during peak periods would require a doubling of I-95’s current average size of seven lanes between Washington and New York City.Steven E. Polzin, director of mobility policy for the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, consented to do his own back-of-the-envelope analysis for us, using a different methodology. He said that a freeway lane can handle 1,800 to 2,000 cars per hour. If each car holds the national average of 1.6 people per vehicle, that means that each lane can accommodate up to 3,200 persons per hour. An eight-coach, two-locomotive Amtrak train has a capacity of 400 riders. So Amtrak would would need to run eight trains per hour to equal the capacity of one freeway lane. (That's more than actually run now: Amtrak often runs two trains an hour from Boston to Washington and another two in the opposite direction, plus some additional trains that travel shorter portions.) Using current Amtrak ridership numbers, Polzin got a similar result -- that eliminating Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor would require one new lane in each direction.Either way, it’s less than one-third of what the Transportation Department study suggests.\"That suggests that the seven-lane number uses some real different assumptions,\" Polzin said. For instance, he said, if you use Amtrak’s 2050 ridership projections, if you assume that all riders go the entire length of the corridor and if demand tends to highly concentrated in a peak hour, \"one could get to three lanes in each direction. But that’s a lot of unlikely ifs.\"Indeed, our sources raised some questions about Biden’s explanation.• Was Biden in his statement sufficiently clear that he meant future traffic loads? When we and several of our experts first read his comment, we assumed he meant that shifting the current train passenger loads to I-95 would require seven new lanes. But Biden’s office clarified that he was referring to both current and future loads. The statement is not phrased incorrectly, but we think it could have been made more precise.• How reliable are the study’s assumptions about rates of growth? The Transportation Department estimated future growth using two different approaches -- projecting travel based on Census data and using travel growth estimates from state departments of transportation. But projections over several decades come with significant uncertainty, so we are taking them with a grain of salt.• Does Biden’s calculation include traffic on regional commuter lines? In his statement, Biden said that shifting Amtrak passenger loads would cause the seven-lane increase. But commuter lines such as MARC, New Jersey Transit and SEPTA also use the corridor, and the Transportation Department confirmed that its study factored in commuter line ridership as well.Commuter lines are far from a trivial factor. Commuter rail trips in the corridor actually exceed Amtrak’s by roughly a 20-to-1 margin, although the two are similar in terms of total miles traveled, since commuter trips are typically shorter than Amtrak jaunts.We think most people would assume that Biden’s reference to shutting down \"Amtrak's Northeast Corridor\" referred only to Amtrak trains. Rail experts (like Biden) may know that closing down one system likely means closing down the other, but we don’t think the average listener would. So we think Biden erred in failing to mention commuter lines alongside Amtrak in his speech.• Does Biden’s calculation assume that all the rail traffic will shift to I-95? Some of the longer-distance traffic is likely to shift to airplanes -- a factor the Transportation Department confirmed did not play into its study. The problem is that the \"real impact\" of shutting down the Northeast Corridor could be felt in the already-congested airports in and around New York, said Robert Puentes, a transportation scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.We should note that Biden did mention the potential impact on airports in a subsequent portion of his Philadelphia speech. But factoring air travel into the statistics about adding lanes would almost certainly have changed the mathematics.• Does Biden’s calculation take into consideration how people actually ride the Northeast Corridor? Say 10,000 riders travel from from Boston to New York, another 10,000 riders travel from New York to Philadelphia and 10,000 riders travel from Philadelphia to Washington. These would be counted as 30,000 riders, and their miles traveled would be lumped together. However, the the impact of switching them to I-95 would only add 10,000 lane trips, not 30,000.So where does this leave us? Biden based his comment on a professionally done, federally sponsored study. However, experts note methodological shortcomings, notably that the study does not factor in air travel, and they offer alternative models that suggest less drastic shifts than seven-lane increases.In addition, Biden compounded these uncertainties by his framing of the study. We don’t think the average person would have assumed he was talking about shutting down commuter rail systems as well as Amtrak. On balance, we rate his statement Barely True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A woman who entered an Uber in Tampa, Florida, on 18February 2019 was the victim of an attempted kidnapping by a \"sex traffic worker.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Kidnapping linked to sex trafficking has emerged in recent years as among the most pervasive fears in online forums and on social media in the United States. Facebook posts that describe “close calls” or thwarted abductions often go viral, feeding off of and further fueling existing fears about the activities of criminal gangs and traffickers, in particular along the United States’ southern border. Many of these warnings are no more than unsubstantiated rumors or urban legends, as we have examined in detail on many occasions over the years. In early 2019, an incident involving an Uber driver in Tampa, Florida, went viral on Facebook, stoking the fears of millions of readers, as Facebook user Emmy Hurley wrote on 19 February: Last night I was picked up by an Uber. Same car, female driver. I MADE A MISTAKE. I got in before checking, as she opened the back door for me from her seat. She drove erratically and didn’t speak. About 10 minutes in, my actual Uber called me asking where I was. My voice cracked, because in that instant I knew. “A car… I think I need help.” She told me not to hang up and to get out of the car however I possibly could. The lady refused to stop or respond to me. I told her she was driving by my friends (random girls I saw) and they would call the cops. She slowed a little, pointing at her phone saying “Uber. I take you back then.” I said, no here is fine. She kept going. I booked it out the door, car still moving. She sped off. I later found out she is a sex traffic worker. They use women to lure people in, and possibly hang out in the Uber lot to steal rides of similar looking cars. The cops didn’t come, but my real Uber driver did, and hugged me, kept me safe, and cried with me. Always, always check your Uber. I’m lucky. The claims contained in Hurley’s post, that she had been the victim of an attempted kidnapping perpetrated by a “sex traffic worker,” appeared to be corroborated in another Facebook post later that day, this time by a woman who presented herself as Hurley’s intended Uber driver, Cristin Cinquino, who wrote: Last night I was doing what I always do, waiting in the lot to get a ride. My phone goes off with a ride from Uber and it’s a girl, she says she’s there waiting. I tell her where to go and tell her i’m [on my way] to get her. I pull up and she’s not there. I called, no answer, called again, no answer, called again, still no answer… something told me not to just mark her as a no show and leave, so I called one more time and she answered. I asked her where she was and she said “who is this?” I said “it’s cristin, your uber driver”, the next 5 min was the LONGEST, SCARIEST 5 min of my life… she said back to me, “i think I got in a car that’s not an uber, I NEED HELP.” I listened on the other end, helplessly, while this girl is crying, begging the driver to let her out. The driver wouldn’t turn around and look at her and kept yelling at her to calm down and saying “i’m uber driver” in a foreign accent. The driver wouldn’t stop and was not headed to her destination, she got off the interstate at the Port of Tampa exit (likely headed to a warehouse near the port or directly to a boat where they ship all these victims away) I told her whatever she does, do NOT hang up the phone and that I didn’t care if the car was moving, leave your stuff and jump out of the car. She finally saw some people walking and told the driver they were her friends and she was on the phone with them and they would call the cops. The driver slowed down and she jumped out and ran. I’m still on the phone this whole time telling her to run as fast as she can and find somewhere she can go inside. I made it to her to pick her up a few minutes later, she got in my car and I hugged her and we cried for a few minutes. I’m pretty sure this woman was watching me and when she saw me get a ride on my phone, she left before me, in the same type of car, and picked up my rider. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, ask your drivers name, tell them to tell you your name, and check the license plate number!!!! It was late, she was tired as her flight was delayed a few hours and made a mistake that likely almost cost her her life. Cinquino’spost was deleted on 20 February, but an archived version can be read here.Her version of the story further fueled its spread, adding the ominous specter of “a warehouse” and “a boat where they ship all these victims away,” as well as claiming that Hurley had almost lost her life in the incident. In reality, both Hurley’s and Cinquino’s accounts were false. Hurley did enter the wrong Uber at Tampa International Airport on 18February, but she was the victim of no more than what Tampa police called a “simple mix-up” and not a life-threatening, attempted kidnapping linked to a sex-trafficking operation. In response to our inquiries, a spokesperson for Tampa Police Department clarified what actually happened, writing in an email that: A woman visiting Tampa posted on Facebook on Tuesday [19February] that she got into the wrong car at the airport, believing it to be her Uber driver. Our investigation indicates that is exactly what happened. However, there is no evidence to support the woman’s statement posted on social media that she later “found out she is a sex traffic worker.” Tampa Police has contacted everyone involved. The driver of the car in question is a legitimate Uber driver who was at the airport to pick up someone else. The driver’s primary language is Spanish. The language barrier, and the fact that the woman got into the wrong car, led to confusion. Unfortunately, that also led to inaccurate conclusions that were then posted on social media. We asked Tampa Police Department whether they had any evidence of a more general recent or ongoing pattern of attempted or successful kidnappings involving Uber or taxi drivers, and in particular incidents related to sex trafficking. The spokesperson was clear in the response: “We don’t have any credible information that reveals a trend or pattern of attempted or completed kidnappings involving ride-share drivers or taxi companies within our jurisdiction.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Barack Obama gave a major speech Dec. 1 to make the case for increasing troops in Afghanistan. But antiwar Democrats still say it's the wrong decision.One of those Democrats is Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida. The night before Obama's speech, Grayson appeared on MSNBC'sThe Ed Showto argue against sending more troops.\"We have people now who are in first grade and second grade who have never known an America their entire lives that was an America at peace. And I think it's time we thought about that, thought about what we're like as human beings and as a country. We need to pursue peace,\" Grayson said.Host Ed Schultz asked Grayson what should be done to oppose the policy.\"What we always do,\" Grayson said. \"Organize, organize and organize. Tell the president, tell our elected representatives, and hope that we can build bridges among enough congressmen so that we can tell the president honestly that this war should be over. And I've been following the polls and I've seen that, in the case of Afghanistan, the polls are shifting. In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there. And that's what we need to do. We need to change people's minds.\"We wondered if Grayson was right about a dramatic shift in the polls on the war in Afghanistan. As usual with polls, a lot depends on how you ask the question.We asked Grayson's staff what polls he was referring to, and they pointed us to a USA Today/Gallup poll taken from Nov. 20-22, 2009.The poll question: \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling the situation in Afghanistan?\" The poll showed a 20-point drop in approval for Obama. In July, 56 percent of respondents said they approved of how he was handling Afghanistan. In November, 35 percent approved.But we don't think approving of Obama's handling of Afghanistan is quite the same as saying Americans \"have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan\" and think we \"shouldn't be there.\"More on point might be the Gallup poll that asked the question, \"Thinking now about U.S. military action in Afghanistan that began in October 2001, do you think the United States made a mistake in sending military forces to Afghanistan, or not?\" The answer to that question has been relatively stable. In November, 60 percent said no, we didn't make a mistake. In July, it was 61 percent, and in August 2008, it was 63 percent.We also found this question from the ABC News/Washington Post poll: \"All in all, considering the costs to the United States versus the benefits to the United States, do you think the war in Afghanistan has been worth fighting, or not?\" In November, 44 percent said yes, it has been worth it. In July that number was 51 percent, and last December it was 55 percent. That's a decline of about 11 points, not more than 20.In reviewing a number of polls about Afghanistan, the approval for Obama's handling of Afghanistan has seen a particularly wide swing this year. This could be because he's displeasing both antiwar Democrats and more conservative Republicans. We should also note that these polls were before his speech, and that it's possible such a high-profile speech could improve Obama's ratings.Grayson said, \"In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there.\" But that 20 percent number represents displeasure with Obama and not the dropoff in support for the war, which is at just 11 percent. And another measurement -- whether people believe the United States made a mistake by sending forces to the country -- has remained stable. So we rate the statement Barely True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:CFO Alex Sink, a Democrat running for governor, is appealing to Florida’s elderly by putting the spotlight on a two-year crackdown on an investment scam and refund to a Delray Beach woman. Sink wrote about the episode in a fundraising e-mail to supporters. \"As Florida’s CFO, I shut down [Larry] Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine [Passinissi] and other victims of this con man,'' she said in an e-mail addressed to \"Dear Friend.\" It said: \"Please contribute $25, or whatever you can, right now to help me keep fighting for Floridians like Josephine.\" Sink’s e-mail contains several claims, but we're focusing on two: Whether the CFO's office shut down the investment \"scam\" and whether it returned $1.2 million to Passinissi and the others.Sink has been claiming credit for the crackdown and using it to promote her Safeguard Our Seniors Task Force since her office put out a release on Sept. 28, 2009, under the headline \"CFO Sink Returns $1.2 Million to Delray Beach Seniors Scammed out of Life Savings.\"The Miami Herald wrote a brief item about the episode at the time that called it insurance fraud and likewise characterized it as Sink returning $1.2 million to four Delray Beach seniors \"after they were allegedly misled into buying equity indexed deferred annuities.\" It said Larry Yale Krakow, who sold the investment products to them, was suspended from selling insurance and was ordered to pay a $25,000 fine.A deferred annuity is an investment product packaged with an insurance policy, in which an insurance company guarantees an income stream to the investor starting at a specified future date in return for a lump sum or series of payments. But the products are usually considered inappropriate for seniors because they tie up needed income.The Herald noted that annuities scams involving seniors have been a growing problem in Florida. And that the Department of Financial Services launched 267 senior annuity investigations in the fiscal year ending June 30.Kevin Cate, Sink's press secretary at the Florida Department of Financial Services, provided us with links to the Florida statutes that illustrate the CFO's authority on the topic. The law also notes the rights of victims not to be identified. He faxed us the 2008 and 2009 settlement agreements that resolved four citizens' complaints against the Allianz insurance company, which Krakow purportedly represented, brought by the Florida Department of Insurance Division of Legal Services. Each had the seniors' identities redacted, but a summary page showed the range in reimbursements. The smallest was $19,319.27, while the largest was for one investor with nine annuities valued at $932,837.09.His summary page also noted that, with subsequent settlements, the figure was more than $1.5 million, which was slightly higher than Sink had said. Sink’s office handled the case through its Division of Insurance Fraud, which is part of the Department of Financial Services.Reached by telephone, Passinissi confirmed the refund. She said her share of it was $270,000. A former owner of a private employment agency, Passinissi, 74, said she tried to get her money out of the annuity in 2008 by contacting the insurance firm itself -- to no avail. She mentioned her plight to a banker she knew, who sent her to Sink. Passinissi said she called and then wrote Sink directly -- and enclosed documents to illustrate the problem.Passinissi is happy to see Sink take credit.\"She wrote to me way, way back and I remember I was very impressed. She said, 'Don’t worry we’ll get to the bottom of it.' After that she sent a person to get a deposition from me, to get the facts,\" Passinissi said.As CFO, Sink oversees the Department of Financial Services, which investigated the complaints and arranged for people such as Passinissi to recoup their money. Sink's claim actually understates the amount that was recouped (she said $1.2 million when it ultimately totaled $1.5 million), but we find she can rightly claim credit for the department's work.So we rate Sink’s claim to be True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:To hear some members of Congress talk, the government’s gone on a hiring binge – at taxpayer expense -- while private-sector hiring is in the dumps. That’s not only lopsided, they say, but it wasn’t the way the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill, was supposed to work.U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette appears to hold this sentiment. Addressing a gathering of the Portage County Tea Party on July 6, the Bainbridge Township Republican noted how other nations are adopting austerity budgets to deal with their economic problems. Yet, LaTourette said, President Barack Obama seems to think that saving government money is a crazy idea, and told world leaders as much during the Group of 20 summit in Canada in late June.Obama \"chastised them and he said, ‘You guys are nuts,’ \" LaTourette said, according to a complete online video of LaTourette’s speech to the Tea Party group. Characterizing Obama’s statements further, LaTourette said the U.S. president told the globe’s economic leaders, \"We need to spend more money. We need to stimulate the economy with government spending.’\"And so as a result,\" LaTourette told his Portage County audience, \"since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know who's done OK and who's not complaining today? The public sector. We've gained 590,000 public sector jobs.\"Is LaTourette correct? We at PolitiFact thought we should check it out.We’ll deal with the numbers momentarily. As far as his characterization of Obama’s sentiments, some license for political hyperbole is in order. Obama doesn’t appear to have called fiscal austerity a nutty idea, and he actually agreed with the global leaders’ goal of halving their budget deficits by 2013.But Obama also said just before the summit that nations must \"be flexible\" in how they cut spending. Withdrawing stimulus measures too quickly, he said, could trigger \"renewed economic hardship and recession,\" according to news service reports. And he argued strongly against \"any early slowing of stimulus spending by governments,\" according to a Voice of America report from the summit, \"saying that it might bring about a second recession.\" Transcripts of Obama’s closing news conference on June 29 in Toronto are consistent with that report.But what about LaTourette’s numbers on hiring?His numbers are right, but only after omitting a key qualifier. In January 2009, there were 110,961,000 private-sector jobs in this country, according to a database of employment statistics maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. By the end of May 2010, that number had dropped to 107,635,000.That means a private-sector job loss of 3.3 million between January 2009 and May 2010, as LaTourette said.As for public sector jobs, LaTourette was counting federal workers and not the state and local workforces, which have actually contracted. In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By May, there were 3,396,000 federal workers. That’s a gain of 593,000, putting LaTourette on the money.But here’s the problem. BLS makes clear, the White House makes clear, and every major news report makes clear when these numbers are released each month that the stimulus had little to do with the growth of the federal workforce. Most of it -- 559,000 new jobs from January 2009 through May – came entirely from the temporary buildup of census workers. And many of those jobs have already disappeared.For example, the government brought on 411,000 temporary U.S. Census Bureau workers in May 2010. But one month later, 225,000 temporary census workers completed their work and were let go. One month made that big a difference.Exclude all the census workers hired from January 2009 through May 2010 and total federal hiring comes to only 34,000, not the 590,000 figure that LaTourette cited.You could contend, as LaTourette’s office did when we contacted it initially, that BLS counts all these jobs in its online databases without separating or distinguishing the Census hires from the rest of the federal workers. That’s true. But BLS makes those distinctions elsewhere -- in its monthly releases of job numbers, and in a fact sheet on census hiring -- and distributes them widely to economists, policymakers, journalists and whatever segment of the public that might be interested.The distinction for the census is crucial here because it was LaTourette who said that \"as a result\" of stimulating the economy, the public sector gained 590,000 jobs.The government gained the jobs, but the stimulus had little to do with it. The hiring was planned before Obama became president, as were the rapid-fire census terminations occurring now . By saying there was a cause and effect, LaTourette went off the mark, but he was accurate with his private-sector number, so we rate his claim Half True. Comment on this item.\n",

            "[Evidences]:'One new school a week' Claim \"We opened at least one new school a week in the Eastern Cape last year [2013] and will continue to eradicate mud schools and other inappropriate structures.\" Verdict incorrect An Africa Check investigation into the department of basic education's \"one school a week\" campaign revealed that education officials had staged ceremonial school \"hand-overs\" months after many of the schools had actually opened their doors. Africa Check spoke to 11 schools, which the department claims it \"delivered\" in 11 weeks. At face value, it seems an impressive achievement. But the real delivery dates (when learning and teaching actually commenced in the schools) showed that the department only delivered those 11 schools over 12 months. In one instance, a school had been open for a full year before a formal opening ceremony was held. And at least two schools were declared \"open\" even though construction had not been completed. By scheduling ceremonial openings to take place week after week, the department created the misleading impression that it was opening a new school a week. In reality, many schools promised by Zuma in the Eastern Cape had failed to materialise . Matric pass rate up Claim \"The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61% in 2009 to 78% last year [2013] and the bachelor passes improve each year.\" Verdict mostly-correct The first part of Zuma's claim was true. In 2009 the matric pass rate was 60.6%. It increased to 78.2% in 2013 . However, South Africa's high dropout rate means that many young people never get the chance to write their matric examinations, let alone pass them. When the matric class of 2013 started grade two in 2003 there were 1,111,858 pupils. But by the time they came to sit for their final exams their numbers had fallen to 562,112. (The latest figures from 2014 show that when the 2014 matrics started grade two in 2004, there were 1,085,570 of them. Only 532,860 pupils remained to write their final matric exams.) The second part of Zuma's claim was false. Bachelor passes had not improved consistently each year since 2009. According to the education department, the number of bachelor passes increased from 109,697 in 2009 to 126,371 in 2010 . But in 2011 the number of bachelor passes dipped to 120,767 , before increasing to 136,047 in 2012 and 171,755 in 2013 . (The most recent data shows that 150,752 pupils achieved a bachelor pass in 2014.) Number of children in Grade R has 'more than doubled' Claim \"The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300,000 to more than 700,000 between 2003 and 2011.\" Verdict correct In 2003 there were 315,387 pupils enrolled in Grade R, according to the department of basic education. By 2011, enrolment had increased to 734,654 . These figures include both public and independent schools. (The most recent data shows that 813,044 students were enrolled in Grade R in 2014.) University enrolments increased Claim \"Student enrolments at universities increased by 12% while Further Education and Training college enrolments have increased by 90%.\" Verdict correct Zuma did not give dates for the increases but his claim appeared to have been supported by the department of higher education and training's 2012/13 annual report. It stated that student enrolment at universities had increased by 12% from 837,779 in 2009 to 938,201 in 2012/13. However, demand for university education far outweighs the number of places available. In 2013, the University of the Witwatersrand received over 35,000 applications for approximately 5,500 first year places. Further Education and Training College enrolments increased from 345,566 in 2010 to 657,690 in 2012/13 - a 90.3% increase.

            "claim [Claim]: The U.S. Department of Energy blocked a request from Texas officials to suspend environmental obligations in order to maximize power generation during a February 2021 winter storm.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In February 2021, as Texas began to recover from a devastating winter storm that brought record-low temperatures, killed dozens of people, and cut the power to millions of homes, a report emerged online that blamed the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden for supposedly denying requests to increase the electricity supply within the state. On Feb. 20, the website Infowars, a notorious producer of conspiracy theories and inflammatory disinformation, published an article with the headline: “Smoking Gun! Joe Biden’s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm.” The article reported that: An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex. Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power! That article was subsequently republished on the website Your News, and both iterations were shared widely on Facebook in the following days. The report was highly inaccurate. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) actually granted a request from Texas officials to temporarily allow energy providers to produce energy at levels that would ordinarily exceed limits set out in environmental regulations, thus having the opposite effect of that claimed by Infowars. The DOE’s authorization did come with certain limitations, namely that the excess electricity generated must only meet levels that state officials deemed “necessary,” but in reality that was a restriction in principle only and effectively gave officials wide discretion to allow excess energy generation during the winter storm. Federal environmental laws and regulations impose certain standards and guidelines on power plants in the United States, limiting the emission of various harmful elements and compounds such as carbon monoxide, mercury, nitrogen oxide, and so on. At the same time, federal law — in particular the Federal Power Act — enables the U.S. energy secretary to declare an emergency in a specific location and “to require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in [their] judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.” Where producing and distributing additional electricity comes in conflict with other regulations, such as environmental regulations, the secretary is required to ensure that excess energy generation and distribution takes place “only during hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.” On Feb. 14 the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the non-governmental organization that runs the electricity grid in the state of Texas, wrote to Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga, requesting that he issue exactly that kind of emergency order. The letter outlined the dilemma faced by energy providers in Texas as follows: ERCOT has been notified by three major generation owners that their generating units will, or are likely to, encounter operating restrictions during the next several days due to various emissions and other limits established in federal permits… These units are subject to a number of environmental limitations that may restrict output. ERCOT has been informed that the operation of gas-fired generators during the next few days could be impacted by permit restrictions on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions, that coal-fired generators would be impacted by permit restrictions on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide, and that generation fueled by distillate fuel oil would be subject to various restrictions on operating duration and/or emissions. ERCOT has also been informed that generators of various fuel types may be subject to wastewater release limits… Because the output from all of the generators subject to these restrictions would help mitigate the impact of rotating outages on Texas consumers during this extreme cold weather event, ERCOT seeks an immediate order from DOE authorizing the provision of additional energy from all generating units subject to emissions or other permit limitations. Later that day, Huizenga issued Emergency Order No. 202-21-1, declaring that “an emergency exists in Texas due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.” The order added: Given the emergency nature of the expected load stress, the responsibility of ERCOT to ensure maximum reliability on its system, and the ability of ERCOT to identify and dispatch generation necessary to meet the additional load, I have determined that additional dispatch of the Specified Resources is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest for purposes of FPA [Federal Power Act] section 202(c). Because the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, I am authorizing only the necessary additional generation, with reporting requirements… So Huizenga’s order temporarily authorized ERCOT, from Feb. 14-19, to generate whatever power it deemed necessary to serve the needs of consumers in Texas, even if that additional generation would, in the normal course of events, cause emissions to exceed maximum levels set out in federal environmental laws and regulations. In keeping with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, Huizenga ordered that the excess electricity must not go beyond what is necessary to address the ongoing emergency, but left the details of that determination to ERCOT itself, adding: ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits. To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes. [Emphasis is added]. In its report, Infowars wrote that: The [Emergency Order] shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards, while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits. In reality, as we have shown, the order did precisely the opposite.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A photograph shared widely in April 2022 showed a divorced couple dividing up their Beanie Babies on the floor of a courtroom.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In April 2022, internet users shared an unusual old photograph along with a caption that read “A divorcing couple divide up their Beanie Baby collection in the court room, 1990s” (or words to that effect). The picture was authentic and unedited, and such descriptions were entirely accurate. Our rating is “True.” For example, one April 17 Facebook post included the picture, along with the caption “A divorcing couple dividing Beanie Babies in court, 1999”: That is exactly what the strangely moving picture shows. It was captured by Reuters photographer Aaron Mayes on Nov. 5, 1999 at the Clark County Family Court in Las Vegas, Nevada. The original Reuters caption reads as follows: Attorney Frank Totti looks over papers while his client Frances Mountain sorts out Beanie Babies with her ex-husband Harold Mountain in Judge Gerald Hardcastle’s Family Courtroom in Las Vegas November 5. The couple, who were divorced four months ago, were ordered to divide up the collection valued at $2,500 to $5000 but were unable to do so by themselves. The collection was ordered spread on the court floor and divided up one by one under the supervision of Family Court Judge Hardcastle. According to Clark County court records, the couple jointly filed for divorce in August 1998, one that Judge Gerald Hardcastle granted in May 1999. A Nov. 5, 1999 entry on the case docket notes “Return Hearing (9:00 AM)…DIVISION OF BEANIE BABIES.” The Las Vegas Sun reported at the time that Hardcastle was intent on making an example of the erstwhile couple, due to their failure to resolve the distribution of the toys: This morning, a frustrated Clark County Family Court judge ordered an erstwhile couple to divide up their collection of Beanie Babies one by one under his supervision in the courtroom. Maple the Bear was the first to go. “This isn’t about toys. It’s about control,” Family Court Judge Gerald Hardcastle told the couple. “Because you folks can’t solve it, it takes the services of a District Court judge, a bailiff and a court reporter.” …Frances and Harold Mountain divorced four months ago. According to the divorce decree, the parties were supposed to divide up their Beanie Baby collection, estimated to be worth between $2,500 and $5,000. But the man and woman failed to split up their toys by themselves. The collection was still in Frances’ possession Thursday when Hardcastle heard Harold’s motion to get his share of the litter. “I’d just had enough,” said Hardcastle, who has been a Family Court judge for seven years. “We spend a lot of time dealing with some simply unreasonable issues. They are time-consuming, expensive issues. A lot of our calendar is made up of just this kind of nonsense. “So I told them to bring the Beanie Babies in, spread them out on the floor, and I’ll have them pick one each until they’re all gone.” Hardcastle also invited reporters.

The video is shared with a caption: How many of you know that Nehru took Citizenship of London in 1956 & took oath to be true to the Queen of England? Here’s the link to the above post. FACT CHECK NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be Misleading. In the video, we noticed the logo of British Pathé on the top right corner. Scanning their YouTube page, we found the same video — dated April 13, 2014 — uploaded with a title: London Honours Two Great Premiers (1956). According to the video description, Prime Minister Nehru of India and Prime Minister Holland of New Zealand receiving the ‘freedom of the City of London’ at the Guildhall. We found archived videos on the website of Associated Press (AP Archive). According to the description, the videos were dated July 4, 1956. We also found the newspaper archive of Indian Express, dated July 4, 1956, and a BBC report published on July 3, 1956, about the same. According to the BBC report, ‘Jawaharlal Nehru of India and Sir Sidney Holland of New Zealand were honoured in a ceremony at the Guildhall in the British capital. The two Commonwealth leaders signed the roll of fame and were given the documents of the Freedom, contained in ornamental caskets, in a service presided over by the Principal Clerk to the Chamberlain’.

            "claim [Claim]: Said Dan McCready \"got nearly $1 million in support from a Nancy Pelosialigned dark money org in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, ‘Dark money has no place in our politics’.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In a tight 2018 congressional race that is now being redone because of allegations ofelection fraud, Democratic candidate Dan McCready spoke outon Twitteragainst dark money in politics. But now he is being accused of benefiting from it. McCready’s opponent in the do-over election, Republican Dan Bishop, called him out in a May 31Facebook postfor receiving support from dark money organizations, citing anarticleby the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political journalism website. \"Turns out ‘Wrong Dan’ (McCready) got nearly $1 million in support from a Nancy Pelosi aligned dark money org in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, ‘Dark money has no place in our politics,’.\" Bishop’s post says. PolitiFact North Carolina found this claim particularly interesting because McCready has been outspoken about his opposition to dark money. When we contacted his campaign, it released a statement from McCready saying he believes that \"money is corrupting our politics and that we’ve got to take on special interests and the status quo, which is why if elected to Congress I will advocate for the mandatory disclosure of all donors to dark money groups.\" \"Federal election law expressly prohibits candidates from coordinating with a political nonprofit on its independent expenditure spending, and the McCready campaign fully complied with the law,\" Amanda Sherman, a spokesperson for McCready’s campaign, said in an email. Sherman also said McCready has been endorsed by End Citizens United, a group dedicated to reversing the Supreme Court decision that allowed dark money groups to grow in influence, Citizens United v. FEC. So, we decided to investigate further. It turns out McCready indeed got support from a dark money group. As for the connection to Pelosi, the truth is a little more complicated. WHAT IS DARK MONEY? TheCenter for Responsive Politicsdefines dark money as \"political spending meant to influence the decision of a voter, where the donor is not disclosed and the source of the money is unknown.\" Dark money groups are usually either political nonprofits that are not required to disclose their donors or super PACs, which are allowed to accept unlimited donations from political nonprofits and other corporations that may or may not have disclosed their donors. Dark money organizations exist on both sides of the political spectrum -- some examples of 501(c) political nonprofits are Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association. \"If you look at the overall amount spent on elections, (dark money) is a relatively small part, but when you look at the most contested races, it’s when you see dark money playing a big role,\" Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said. \"Dark money and outside money, generally, tend to gravitate towards the most competitive races.\" McCready’s 2018 congressional race against Republican Mark Harris was one of those tight elections that drew outside spending. DID MCCREADY GET SUPPORT FROM DARK MONEY? Patriot Majority USA is a lesser known, liberal-leaning dark money nonprofit. We found that, as Bishop said, the group supported McCready in 2018. Patriot Majority spent $944,060 against Harris. However, Patriot Majority did not send money directly to McCready’s campaign. Instead, it ranTV adsattacking Harris’ campaign for being \"out of step\" with North Carolina families and alleging that Harris wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare. The ads did not say anything about McCready. Anna Massoglia, a researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics who specializes in dark money, said this is a common tactic used by these organizations. \"In many cases, the spending that we do see on political ads by dark money is more common actually against a candidate than in support of one,\" Massoglia said. \"...They aren’t necessarily ‘using’ dark money, I wouldn’t use that term. I would say that they benefit from dark money whether they like it or not.\" If a dark money organization decides to use their money against a candidate, there is really not much a campaign can do, said Robin Kolodny, a professor of political science at Temple University who specializes in political consultants and campaign finances. \"(Patriot Majority USA) is entirely independent of the campaign and there is nothing either candidate could do to stop the spending even if they wanted to,\" Kolodny said. \"The Supreme Court has held time and again that people may exercise their free speech in whatever amounts they wish.\" IS PATRIOT MAJORITY USA ALIGNED WITH NANCY PELOSI? The claim that McCready is in cahoots with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was actually the subject ofanother fact-checkby PolitiFact, based on a claim made by Harris in 2018 that was found Half True. \"It’s certainly true that Patriot Majority is a dark money group, and that they support Democrats, and that they’re aligned with Democrats,\" Fischer said. \"I don’t know if that’s enough to say that they’re specifically aligned with Nancy Pelosi, unless they’re using Nancy Pelosi as a stand-in for all Democrats.\" While we know that Patriot Majority USA spent almost all of its money in support of Democratic House candidates, we couldn’t find a record of Patriot Majority USA being connected to Pelosi. The McCready campaign also received support from the House Majority PAC — a super PAC that is not considered dark money because it discloses its sponsors, according to Massoglia. House Majority PAC is known to be aligned with Pelosi. She raised money for it in 2011, when it first started. In 2018, the House Majority PAC spent $340,018 against Harris, benefiting McCready. OUR RULING Bishop is correct that McCready received support from a dark money group. The McCready campaign did not take money from the group and cannot control the independent expenditures of outside organizations, but that doesn’t change the fact that the campaign benefited. While we know that Patriot Majority USA is aligned with the Democratic Party and spent most of its money on House Democrats, we didn’t find evidence that Pelosi is aligned with Patriot Majority USA. And while the Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC did support the McCready campaign by spending money against Harris, it is not considered a dark money group because it discloses its donors. Therefore, we rate Bishop’s statement Mostly True. UPDATE: This story was updated after publication to add McCready's position on changing campaign disclosure laws. This does not change our ruling.

            "[Evidences]:A post is being shared on social media claiming that banks will charge 173 rupees for every Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transaction beyond the permissible limit. This post claims that beyond four free ATM transactions, banks are going to charge ₹ 150 tax and ₹ 23 additional service charge for every transaction. Also, the post claims that beyond four free bank transactions, banks will charge ₹ 150 rupees per additional bank transaction. According to the post, these new guidelines will come into force from 01 August 2021. Let’s verify the claims made in the post. The archived version of the posts can be seen here. Claim: Banks are now going to charge 173 rupees for every ATM transaction beyond the permissible limit. Fact: On 10 June 2021, RBI issued a notification by revising the interchange fees and customer service charges of Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. According to the new RBI regulations, customers are eligible for five free transactions every month from their own bank ATMs and three free transactions in other bank ATMs in metro centres. Beyond the free transactions, banks are allowed to charge 21 rupees for every additional ATM transaction. These RBI guidelines will come into force from 01 January 2022. The charges mentioned in the post are related to the cash transfer charges (does not include ATM transactions) in few private banks including ICICI, HDFC and HDFC. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. When we searched to check whether RBI had issued any such new regulations on their website, we found out that on 10 June 2021, RBI had issued a notification by revising the interchange fee structure and customer service charges of Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. Considering the increasing cost of ATM deployment, expenses towards ATM maintenance and the need to balance the expectations of stakeholders, RBI decided to increase the interchange fees and customer service charges of ATM transactions. According to the new RBI guidelines, customers are eligible for five free transactions every month from their own bank ATMs. They are also eligible for three free transactions in other bank ATMs in 6 metro centres, and five free transactions in non-metro centres. Beyond the free transactions, banks are allowed to charge ₹ 21 for every ATM transaction. These RBI new guidelines will come into force from 01 January 2022. Currently, banks are charging ₹ 20 for every ATM transaction beyond the permissible limit. Several news websites published articles reporting the new guidelines issued by RBI. They can be seen here and here. The charges mentioned in the post are related to the cash transfer charges (does not include ATM transactions) in few private banks including ICICI, HDFC and AXIS banks. ICICI recently issued a notification by revising the limits of cash transactions, ATM interchange and chequebook charges. These new regulations reportedly came into force from 01 August 2021. According to the ICICI regulations, ICICI allows their customers four free cash transactions (cumulative of both deposit and withdrawals) per month. Thereafter, it will charge 150 rupees for every cash transaction. HDFC and AXIS banks are also charging the same cash transfer fees from their customers. ICICI, HDFC and AXIS banks are charging ₹ 20 for every ATM transaction beyond the free limit. The ATM interchange and cash transaction charges in these banks can be seen here, here, and here. To sum it up, banks will not charge 173 rupees for every ATM transaction beyond the permissible limit.\n",

            "[Evidences]:As a longtime gun owner, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens made his support for Second Amendment rights one of the early themes of his campaign for U.S. Senate. Rubens launched a \"2nd Amendment Protection Tour\" earlier this year, traveling to gun shops around the state to pledge his support for firearms owners. It was a move that invited comparisons between himself and the man he views as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Brown has voiced support for increased gun control after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and has since faced blowback from gun owners in New Hampshire. During a stop at Lee’s Gun Shop in Hudson, Rubens said he would oppose a ban on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines if voters send him to Washington to replace Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Rubens also provided recommendations to address gun violence and mass shootings, such as encouraging schools to hire armed security personnel. The presence of armed civilians would send the message that shooters won’t achieve their aims, he said. \"In mass shooting incidents where you had a person inside the premises during the incident, you have an average of 2.5 people killed if there is someone with a firearm able to stop the crime in progress,\" he said. \"In similar instances where there’s no such person with a firearm, you have an average of 18 people killed and dead as a result of it.\" This seemed like a sharp contrast, so we asked Rubens to back up his claim about shooting deaths. His campaign pointed us to an article by Davi Barker, who runs a website called Daily Anarchist. In July 2012, Barker wrote that he studied several mass shootings and determined the average number of people killed in mass shootings when the shooter is stopped by police is 18.25. \"I based it on 10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere,\" he wrote. \"I honestly don’t even remember where.\" Barker was challenged when he posted these statistics on Facebook, leading him to conduct a more thorough study, according to his website. After reviewing 100 \"rampage shooting\" incidents, Barker revised his calculations, claiming that the number of people killed when the shooter is stopped by police is really closer to 14.29. He pegged the average for incidents in which civilians stop the shooter at 2.33. The Rubens campaign acknowledged that the figures he provided were incorrect, saying that Rubens now stands behind Barker’s latest figures. \"Bottom line remains: an on-premises armed citizen saves lives in a shooting rampage in a public place,\" communications director Brian Tilton wrote in an email. We looked for a separate analysis of shooting incidents to determine whether those casualty figures are accurate. One of the best sources we found is an academic study published in January in an FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin by Dr. Pete Blair, director of research for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT) and an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University. Blair and two other researchers examined more than 100 shootings between 2000 and 2012, investigating factors such as the average response time of law enforcement and the outcomes based on the actions taken by civilians at the scene. Looking at \"active shooter\" incidents, the study found the median number of people shot is five (excluding the perpetrator). Blair said shooting incidents that lead to deaths in the range of 18 people -- the number Rubens initially offered -- are rare. \"Eighteen would be really out there,\" he said. The study documented only nine incidents in which the number of people killed or wounded was 14 or higher. Blair also pointed out problems with the terminology Rubens used in his statement. The term \"mass shooting\" is widely understood to mean an incident in which four or more people are shot, he said. Therefore, incidents in which only two or three people are shot -- the average Rubens offered when civilians take action -- would generally be excluded from the category of mass shootings. Blair said it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Roughly half of all active shooter events Blair studied ended before law enforcement officers arrived. The most common occurrence was that the shooter stopped the attack spontaneously on their own. The decision was often made after an initial burst of violence, in which the shooter attacked everyone who was in the immediate area, Blair said. When those who remained either ran away or barricaded themselves in secure areas, shooters often made the decision to leave the attack site or commit suicide, he said. Blair said he also documented cases in which civilians took direct action. Civilians stopped about one out of every six active shooter events, but their actions rarely involved the use of firearms, he said. The most common method was tackling the attacker, as was the case during a campus shooting in Seattle this week. Blair said he found only three cases in which an armed civilian shot the attacker, and in two of those incidents, the civilian who took action was an off-duty police officer. Blair said it would be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of armed civilians in stopping active shooter events based on the limited data that exists. In general though, Blair said, fewer people were killed or injured in the events that ended before police showed up at the scene -- either because civilians took action, or because the shooter spontaneously stopped or committed suicide. Data suggests the best course of action for civilians is first to avoid the attacker, and if that’s not possible, to deny access by barricading themselves in locked rooms or other secure areas. Blair teaches training courses for law enforcement and civilians on how to respond to active shooter events through ALERRT, which receives funding from the Bureau of Justice Administration at the U.S. Department of Justice and from the Texas governor’s office. Blair said he encourages civilians to take physical action to defend themselves only when it’s impossible to escape. \"We see the firearm as being an adjunct to that part,\" he said. Blair said there are pros and cons to having armed civilians at the scene of a shooting. Confronting the shooter with a gun would likely provide the fastest resolution, he said. But if multiple civilians are wielding guns at the scene, it could also create confusion about who the shooter is -- particularly for police who are arriving to render aid. Our ruling Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Finally, both Rubens and the internet blogger who first offered the statistics that Rubens cited have acknowledged the figures were incorrect. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2.33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Allen West, a Republican candidate for Congress for the South Florida seat now held by Democratic Rep. Ron Klein, claims that close to half of Americans aren't paying \"any taxes.\" On a page about the economy on his Web site, West claims, \"Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes.\" That's a strong claim -- that nearly half of Americans aren't paying \"any taxes.\" We wondered, could that be true?First, a look at the context in which West made this claim. He made it in a section that focuses on income taxes -- though he said \"any taxes\":\"If we are serious about restoring the American economy then suspend payroll taxes until the situation improves. I would begin with a 3 month suspension and willingly extend that to 6 months if necessary. In order to inspire investment, innovation, ingenuity, and real growth we must end capital gains, dividend, and death taxes, just abolish immediately. We should begin to redefine our tax code, no more progressive tax system; we need to go to a flat tax system. Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes; a (flat tax) rate of around 15-17% would be adequate. A twist I recommend is to have a flat tax up to an income level of $2 Million, then institute a progressive system. My intent is to inspire Americans to earn and develop their wealth.:The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes federal income tax issues, found the number was actually 36.3 percent based on tax year 2008 filed in 2009. The figure refers to federal income taxes.\"We found that out of the 142 million tax returns filed, roughly 51.6 million paid no income taxes or had negative income tax liability,'' said spokesperson Natasha Altamirano in an interview April 26, 2010. That equals 36.3 percent \"who paid no income taxes or got additional money through refundable tax credits\" and she added the 2008 numbers are actually the record high. Altamirano said that it's important be precise in describing that group. \"One of the problems is when people say 'half of everyone, one-third of everyone does not pay taxes' -- that's not true,'' she said, because it omits other types of taxes such as property and sales taxes that those people still pay. \"This is just federal income tax. Unless they are saying 'federal income taxes' it's just not true.''Another measure: According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, 46.9 percent of Americans paid no federal income taxes for 2009, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.We read him Allen West's quote about 40 to 45 percent of Americans not paying \"any taxes,\" and Williams said: \"That's not true at all.\"People who don't pay income taxes probably pay taxes in many other ways such as state and local sales tax and state and federal taxes on gasoline and alcohol. To avoid paying taxes entirely, \"you couldn't drink, you couldn't smoke, you couldn't drive a car, you couldn't live in a house,'' Williams said. \"It's hard to avoid them. We are very careful when we say 47 percent pay no federal income tax.\"West campaign spokeswoman Valentina Weis said West was referring to federal income tax.\"This paragraph refers to Allen's position on the federal income tax, and it has been well documented that the mentioned percentage (actually quoted higher in some instances, 47 percent) do not pay any federal income taxes,'' she wrote in an e-mail. We spoke to West, who also told us that his claim referred to federal income taxes. When asked why he didn't state \"federal income taxes\" rather than \"any tax\" he said:\"I presume people are smart enough to know what I'm talking about because I'm running for federal office,'' he said in an interview. West's campaign provided links to an editorial in USA Today and articles from CNN, the AP and Business Insider which cite the 47 percent figure. West's statement was made within a paragraph in which he discussed taxes, including several aspects of the income tax, but it appeared on a page about the economy that covered a range of financial issues including the \"death tax,\" sub-prime mortgages and foreign aid. If West meant to say 40 to 45 percent of Americans don't pay \"federal income taxes,\" he could have been more specific. As it is currently worded, the sentence is not specific and can lead people to believe he was referring to all types of taxes. So for the lack of important context, we rate this claim Barely True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:DA candidate Tariq El-Shabazz went nuclear on reporter Ryan Briggs last week after Briggs published an investigative story onCity & State PAquestioning El-Shabazz’s handling of a 2000 murder case. In a two-page critique released on Twitter, El-Shabazz referred to Briggs as a \"fake news reporter\" and accused him of racism. The long statement, released Friday, also suggested Briggs had incorrectly stated the former client of El Shabazz was on death row and included this line: \"In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death.\" Has El-Shabazz really never represented someone who was sentenced to death? We’ll start with Anthony Brown.Briggs’ articleoriginally included the following passage: \"With nothing but death row ahead of him, Brown began to file state and federal court petitions largely centering around El-Shabazz’s failure to investigate his case.\" According to aPhiladelphia Daily Newsarticle from 2000, Brown was given a life sentence for the murder. State records also indicate nobody by the name Anthony Brown has been sentenced to death in Pennsylvania. Greg Salisbury, editor ofCity & State PA, said the line about death row was a copy editing error. He said the story was corrected Monday. The above sentence now reads, \"With nothing but the rest of his life in prison ahead of him,\" and a correction is noted at the end of the piece. But another client of El-Shabazz, infamous drug dealer Kaboni Savage, presents a murkier picture. In 2013, Savage was given a federal death sentence for 12 counts of murder, six of which stemmed from a 2004 retaliatory fire bombing in North Philly. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage during the federal case for which he received the death penalty. Salima Suswell, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz, said he was disqualified from representing Savage because of a conflict of interest and couldn’t represent him. The conflict arose because of the earlier case in which he repped Savage. In federal court filings, El-Shabazz is not listed as an attorney for Savage in the case. The earliest motion by the defense comes from Christopher Warren, who was a court-appointed attorney. Savage wasn’t El-Shabazz’s client in that matter, Suswell said. \"So the statement stands as true.\" A 2004Inquirerarticle indicates El-Shabazz was representing Savage when the drug dealer was already being suspected — but not yet charged — in the fire bombing. The article explains that the FBI was targeting Savage, lists El-Shabazz as his lawyer and quotes him as saying Savage had nothing to do with the firebombing \"directly or indirectly.\" So the fact-check comes down to this question: Is it fair for a lawyer to say none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death when a major client of his received a death sentence in a case he didn’t litigate after being disqualified from representing him? Two legal experts say yes. Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at Penn, said given the context, El-Shabazz’s statement is not incorrect. \"He’s trying to prove he’s a good lawyer,\" Finkelstein said. \"If you look at the spirit of it, it doesn’t falsify the claim. He’s not responsible for that guy getting the death penalty.\" Said Jules Epstein, a longtime trial lawyer and a professor at Temple Law, who disclosed that he knows El-Shabazz: \"The fact that a former client got the death penalty with a different attorney is no reflection on this lawyer whatsoever.\" Our Ruling After a critical article was published about him last week, Tariq El-Shabazz released a statement Friday calling reporter Ryan Briggs racist and of publishing fake news. In his statement, El-Shabazz said the article had incorrectly claimed former client Anthony Brown was given a death sentence and that not a single client of his had ever been sentenced to death. Brown was not given the death penalty. He received a life sentence, andCity & State PAcorrected the error Monday. But a former client of El-Shabazz, Kaboni Savage, received a death sentence. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage in the federal case that led to the sentence. Because he didn’t represent Savage in that case, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz said his claim stands as true. A former trial lawyer and expert on legal ethics agree. But while true in a legal sense, El-Shabazz’s statement needs clarification. We rule the claim Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:SecurityClaim “Our ratio of police to the population is 1 officer for 380 citizens, better than the prescribed UN ratio of 1 officer for every 450 citizens.\" Verdict incorrectThe police to population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has 1 police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100.In its pre-electionmanifestolaunchedinFebruary2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s ruling party pledged to“increase the police-citizen ratio from 1:1,150 to a ratio of 1:800 citizens within five years...”.(Note: The actual ratio continues to vary - for example on 3 MarchKenyatta saidthe ratio in 2013 “was 1 policeman to 1,000 civilians”.)In a January 2017 speech, Kenyatta said that “we now have 98,732 officers in our ranks compared to 78,885 in 2013, an increase of more than 25%”.In its 2013-2018strategic plan, theNational Police Serviceshowed that75,325 people (not 78,885) served in its three branches in 2013.Africa Check contacted inspector-general Joseph Boinnet to clarify these numbers, but he is yet to provide the data, despite promising to do so.In March 2017, some 5,916 officers graduated. Using the president’s numbers, this would bring the total number of police officers to 104,648. In itsmost recent estimate, theKenya National Bureau of Statisticsplaced Kenya’s population at 44.2 million in 2015.Using these numbers, the ratio works out to a policeman for every 422 Kenyans. For the ratio to be 1:380, Kenya’s current population would have to be to 39.8 million, or police numbers would need to increase to 116,315.Senior researcher forAmnesty International,Abdullahi Boru,reckons thatthe president was using Kenya’s 2009 population estimate of 38.6 million people to work out the ratio, despite there beingnewer estimates of the population.A second issue with the ratio is that theUN defines police personnelas “those whose principal functions are the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and the apprehension of alleged offenders”.The UN (which gets its data from the official data agency) therefore only includes the number of Kenya Police members, who are often referred to as the regular police, in its database.If we use the number of regular police members atlast count by the National Police Service Commission(44,705), the ratio works out to 1 police officer for every 989 KenyansIf we add the new recruits the ratio falls to 1:872.Africa Check was unable to find proof that the UN has ever recommended a ratio of 1:450. It seems to date back to theUnited States’ policing of occupied Germany in 1945when one American policeman oversaw 450 German civilians.Available literatureshows thatits success at the time has tended to inform international policing.Analystswe spoke to saidthe focus should be on the quality of policing , not absolute numbers.DevolutionClaim “My administration has gone over and beyond the constitutional requirement by increasing the percentage of shareable revenues [with Kenya's counties] from 15% to 34%.\" Verdict correctIn 2010,a new constitutionprovided for the creation of 47 county governments. The sharing of revenue between them has generatedconsiderable political debateincluding calls for areferendum to increase the share to the counties.The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of “not less that 15%” of all revenue collected by the national government. This amount is calculated using “the most recent audited accounts of revenue received, as approved by the National Assembly.”TheCommission on Revenue Allocationis tasked with this,according to Jason Lakin, a research fellow at theInternational Budget Partnership. The agency’s proposals are then submitted toparliament,whichenactsalaw outlining what both the national government and counties are due.The commission’sdata showsthat county governments got KSh190 billion in the 2013/14 financial year and KSh226.66 billion in the 2014/15 financial year. The most recent audited accounts were those of 2010/11, which showed theBut because these had not been approved by the National Assembly as the chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee Mutava Musyimitold the Housethen, 2009/10 revenues were used.Based on this data, the revenue was KSh529.3 billion, meaning the allocations worked out to 28% of the “most recent audited accounts of revenue” that had been approved.The same base yearwas usedfor the 2014/15 allocation, with KSh226.66 billion going to the counties. This was 43% of the most recent audited and approved accounts of revenue.For the 2015/16 financial year, revenue data from 2012/13 was used, which showed KSh776.9 billion had been collected by the national government. The allocation to counties was KSh 259.8 billion, or 33%.Lawmakers further approved audited accounts for the financial year 2013/14,raising the base revenueto KSh935.5 billion. The counties got KSh302 billion, or 32.3% for the 2016/17 financial year.(Note: TreasuryrecordedKSh304.2 billion, or 33% of audited revenue.)Over the four years, allocation to Kenya's counties works out to an average 34% of the most recent audited accounts of revenues - above the constitutional threshold of \"not less than 15%”.EconomyClaim “Our gross domestic product has expanded at [a] strong average annual growth rate of 5.9% since 2013.\" Verdict unprovenIn its most recentquarterly report, theNational Treasurysays that Kenya’s economy grew by 5.7 % in 2013, fell to 5.3 % in 2014 and recovered to 5.6 % in 2015.These figures are mirrored in theEconomic Survey 2016produced by theKenya National Bureau of Statistics, the government’s official data agency.For 2016, Treasuryrecords average growthacross the first, second and third quarters of 2016 at 5.9%, 6.2% and 5.7% respectively.The World Bank, in its October 2016Kenya Economic Updateforecast full2016 growth of 5.9%.TheParliamentary Budget Officethe non-partisan office that advises parliament on the budget and the economy - in a forecast released in March 2017has predictedthat the economy in 2016 would grow by 5.8%, with a slower Q4 growth of 5.4%. This, it says, is due to reduced rainfall, slower manufacturing output and the effects of an interest rate cap, which the president admitted was hurting lending.We have asked the presidency for the source of the president’s economic numbers and will update this report with their response.In the absence of full 2016 data however, we find this claimunprovenbecause evidence publicly available at this time neither proves nor disproves the statement.Despite this brisk growth, therehas been concernthat many Kenyans are not benefiting, sentiments that Kenyatta also acknowledged.Kwame Owino is the chief executive officer of theInstitute of Economic Affairsthink-tank in Kenya. He said that despite the country’s growth being above the regional average, it was not being felt in the country because the bulk of it was in big-money investment into a KSh447 billionstandard-gauge railway project.Funded by a loan from China and with the main contractor being a Chinese firm, it is planned to connect the coastal city of Mombasa with the western Kenya border town of Malaba and is the current administration’s flagship project.“Most of what we are calling growth is driven by the standard-gauge railway. Most of the money is going back to China, and only a small share has percolated, so to speak, into the local economy, and even that is not distributed evenly,” Owino told Africa Check.Claim “Our debt is at about 50% of our gross domestic product.” Verdict downplayedKenyatta’s reference to the country’s public debt followed what he said were legitimate concerns that it might be too high.(Note:Public debtis how much a government owes to lenders. It is not the same as external debt, which is what is owed to foreign investors by both the government and private entities.)PreliminaryInternational Monetary Fundfindingsput Kenya’s debt at 52.1% of its gross domestic project in the 2015/16 financial year, which ended on 30 June 2016. This is compared to a 2014/15 debt ratio of 48.7% of GDP.(Note: The IMF projects Kenya's debt to be at 52.5% of GDP in the current financial year, rising to 53.3% in 2017/18.)As for calendar years, the ratio was at 48.6% of GDP in 2014 and 51.2% in 2015, rising to a projected 54.4% in 2016.Development economistAnzetse Weretold Africa Check that rising debt may not be sustainable in the long run. This was due to ballooning non-productive spending, she said, citing recurrent expenditure such as salaries.“The government needs to focus on getting the balance between recurrent and development expenditure right,” she said.A 2010 World Bank studyfound thatfor developing economies, a debt-to-GDP ratio of 64% was the “tipping point” at which public debt would hurt economic growth.Public wage billClaim “In simple terms, 50% of all the money collected as revenues in Kenya goes into the pockets of less than 2% of the country's total population.\" Verdict correctThe most recent estimate of Kenya’s population is44.2 million, contained in the 2015 Economic Survey by theKenya National Bureau of Statistics.Using this data, the country would need to have not more than 884,000 people on its public payroll. In his speech, Kenyatta said 700,000 public officers were being paid KSh627 billion, an amount he termed “staggering”.A recentauditcommissioned by Kenya’s parliament and overseen by theauditor-generalfound that there were 700,700 public sector workers in 2013. The bureau’s Economic Surveycaptured718,400 workers as contracted in 2015.Does their pay, which includes both salaries and allowances, take up more than half the government’s revenue?TheKenya Revenue Authorityis the principal tax collector of revenue in the country. The commissioner-general of the authorityput tax collectedin the financial year 2015/16 at KSh1.2 trillion.This figure is also backed up by the Treasury’sBudget Review and Outlook Paperfor 2016 which records that total tax revenue including appropriations-in-aid (budget jargon for monies that a department can retain, such as fees and levies) amounted to KSh1.237 trillion.The numbers thus appear to support the president’s claim.Senior University of Nairobi lecturer Gerrishon Ikiara says the issue is clearly a major public concern as a higher wage bill means the country has less money to use on development.“Controlling it is not easy due to a liberal constitution that has spurred strikes and also partisan interests,” Ikiara, who focuses on economics and development studies, told Africa Check.“An economical way of dealing with issues such as overrepresentation may be by tabling them at [upcoming elections], but also by picking leaders who see the bigger picture.”HealthClaim “Today, we have doubled the numbers of expectant mothers delivering under the care of skilled medical attendants to over 1.2 million by the end of 2016.” Verdict unprovenWhen he took office in 2013, Kenyattatold parliamentthat he would “expand and promote maternal, child and primary health care services” and “abolish all charges” for women giving birth at public hospitals.Kenya’sDemographic Health Survey of 2014showed that between 2009 and 2014,37% of births took place at home, while 61% were in a health facility. Nearly all of the births in a health facility were facilitated by a skilled medical attendant, translating to 62% of all births in the period surveyed.Kenya National Bureau of Statisticsdata shows that of the 870,599 births registered in 2013, a total of 711,105 births (or 81.7%) took place in health facilities.In 2014, births in health facilities rose to 796,230 out of a total of 954,254 listed (or 83.4%). Provisional 2015 figures showed that 855,720 out of a total of 950,226 births - 90% - were in health facilities. The agency has yet to release 2016 data.Did the number of mothers delivering under the care of skilled attendants jump more than 40%, from 855,720 in 2015 to over 1.2 million a year later? In the absence of the latest data, it is impossible to say.ElectrificationClaim “Today, we have connected an additional 3.7 million new homes to electricity.” Verdict incorrectThe supply of energy to Kenyans is the mandate of the national power utility company,Kenya Power. Theministry of energyhas oversight over new connections, though, including through theRural Electrification Project.In the last financial year of the preceding government,2,330,962 customers were connected to the power grid. In the first full financial year of the Kenyatta administration (2013/14), the number of connections rose to 2,766,441. At the end of June 2016, Kenya Powernotedthat it had connected 4.89 million customers.When the head of Kenya Power, Ben Chumo, left the company in January 2017,he saidthat one of his major achievements was increasing the customer base from 2.2 million in 2013 to 5.5 million in 2016 - which would be an increase of 3.3 million. (Note: These figures were echoed by energy cabinet secretary Charles Keter in abrieftwo days later.)However,following media reportsthat nearly a million of these connections were inactive, Kenya Powersaid974,173 connections were “zero-vend” ones (meaning no power units were bought since installation).

That figure is also replicated inthe Budget Policy Statement 2017.According to theEconomic Survey 2016by theKenya National Bureau of Statistics, roads “under bitumen” increased from 11,300 km in July 2013 to 13,900 km by July 2015.However, the survey did not clarify whether this increase of 2,600 km was “new roads” or existing roads that had been tarred.In the data agency’sStatistical Abstract 2016, a table sourced from theKenya Roads Boardshows that the bitumen roads rose from 11,230 km in 2013 to 11,274 km in 2015 and 11,378 km in 2016, or only an additional 148 km.We have contacted the roads board for comment and will update this report with their response.

            "[Evidences]:There is no evidence that the Philadelphia experiment actually happened or that a ship disappeared and traveled in the future. An Instagram account called \"aiasanworld,\" which has 160k followers, posted a photo on September 30. The photo features a ship and the text on the photo reads, \"Philadelphia experiment: It began as WW2 Navy Experiment to demagnetize military ships & make them Radar invisible. It ended with a ship completely disappear & time travelled 40 years in future.\" This claim around the Philadelphia experiment is baseless. It has been circulating for years and has been debunked previously. The theory is so popular that two movies have been made on this, and several books have been written about it. Stories around the Philadelphia experiment usually have the same underlying claim about a ship disappearing and people on board traveling into the future. According to an article in the Guardian, the story of this military experiment is often referred to as Project Rainbow. The article states, \"As part of Project Rainbow, while docked at Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1943, the cannon-class destroyer USS Eldridge (DE 173) was fitted with a number of powerful generators and something called a 'time zero generator'. When this was switched on, the Eldridge was engulfed in a greenish haze, then, with the imprint of its hull still visible in the water, the ship disappeared from view for 20 minutes. Following the experiment, the Eldridge's crew appeared highly excitable, even ravingly insane. Those onboard claimed to have seen another port, Newport News in Virginia, 600 miles from Philadelphia. Had the ship been teleported there during the experiment? A second experiment took place a few weeks later, this time at sea accompanied by SS Andrew Furuseth. Once again, the Eldridge vanished but, when it reappeared, many of its crew were horribly burned, others had 'merged' with the structure of the ship. One vanished entirely.\" The article debunks the story citing false details. It says, \"Of course, the story is hokum, created by eccentric UFO enthusiast Carl Allen in 1956.\" According to an article in Military.com, Edward Dudgeon, who served in the U.S. Navy aboard the USS Engstrom, which was dry-docked in the Philadelphia Naval Yard where the Eldridge was, \"both ships did have classified devices on board. They were neither invisibility cloaks nor teleportation drives designed by aliens, but instead, they scrambled the magnetic signatures of ships using the degaussing technique, which provided protection from magnetic torpedoes aboard U-boats.\" Furthermore, How Stuff Works suggested that \"the 'green glow' reported by witnesses that day could be explained by an electric storm or St. Elmo's Fire which, in addition to being an American coming-of-age film starring the Brat Pack, is a weather phenomenon in which plasma is created in a strong electric field, giving off a bright glow, almost like fire. Finally, inland canals connected Norfolk to Philadelphia, allowing a ship to travel between the two in a few hours.\" Furthermore, a letter from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) was posted online in September 1996 by the U.S. military’s Washington Headquarters Services. The letter states that the ONR had received many queries about its possible role in Eldridge’s “disappearance.\" The ONR says these suspicions may stem from real experiments in making a ship undetectable or \"invisible\" to magnetic mines. But not invisible to the human eye. The letter says that the ONR “has never conducted any investigations on invisibility, either in 1943 or at any other time.\" The ONR also says that its scientists “do not believe that such an experiment could be possible except in the realm of science fiction.\"\n",

            "[Evidences]:Two videos with similar inaccurate headlines misleadingly claimed former Vice President Leni Robredo could soon be spending time in jail after the Commission on Audit (COA) flagged her old office in its 2021 audit report. The inaccurate videos with the misleading claim first appeared on July 19, then again on July 24. One of the videos bore the headline: “LENI, SA KUL0NGAN NA TATANDA MATAPOS MAHALUGHOG NI COA CHAIRMAN CALIDA KATIWALIANG NANGYARI SA OVP (Leni will grow old in prison after COA Chairman [Jose] Calida unearthed the corruption inside the OVP [Office of the Vice President]).” The voice-over for the July 19 video claimed Robredo could “possibly” be sent to prison after the Calida-led COA marked out the OVP for illegally hiring a private lawyer after allegedly “squandering” pandemic-related funds worth over P25 million. This claim twisted the facts on the matter. In the report, released July 15, COA flagged the OVP for the unauthorized hiring of legal consultants without the prior approval of the solicitor general, which violated COA rules and regulations. Contrary to the claim in the video, the OVP was not flagged for “squandering” public funds. Former OVP spokesperson Barry Gutierrez clarified on July 20 that the OVP appealed the matter to COA on May 27, which COA successfully granted on June 29, and “effectively lifted” the notice of disallowance issued by COA on the hiring. Gutierrez also said that the consultant worked for the OVP as a “key adviser on policy matters” and not as a lawyer. In another section of the annual audit on the OVP, the COA also flagged the office for realigning its P25-million COVID-19 research budget to other services and COVID-19 projects after failing to “obtain suitable project proposal.” The COA recommended that the OVP “exercise prudence in managing government funds.” On the other hand, the narrator of the other video, dated July 24, claimed that COA investigated the OVP’s hiring of a private lawyer for Robredo’s non-profit organization (NGO) Angat Buhay. It is not true. Robredo’s NGO, officially named “Angat Pinas Inc.,” was registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission and launched on July 1 this year, which is outside the COA report’s scope of calendar year 2021. These videos emerged a few days after the COA released its 2021 annual audit reports on all national agencies, local government units and other state-owned corporations. The two misleading videos, published by YouTube channels WHISTLE-BLOWER PH (created on Nov. 13, 2021) and BANAT PH UPDATE TV (Oct. 13, 2021), collectively garnered more than 81,300 views. BANAT PH UPDATE TV’s video was reuploaded by Facebook pages Stardust & Stories (April 8, 2020) and Bbm&Sara2022 (March 15, 2022), receiving more than 76,600 views, 4,700 reactions, 1,000 comments and 1,300 shares.

            "[Evidences]:IN SHORT: Social media posts warn users to avoid \"unexpected death at night\" by adhering to a \"three half minute pauses\" rule, but this strange advice is simply not true. \"Sudden unexpected death at night – how to avoid it,\" starts several posts doing the rounds on Facebook in South Africa. The posts warn that those who get up in the middle of the night or early morning to urinate need to \"take note of the 3 half minute pauses\", which will \"greatly reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death\". According to the posts, standing up too quickly from a lying position causes \"lack of sufficient blood flow to the brain\". The posts say that when waking up, you should lie in bed for the first half a minute, then sit in bed for the next half, and then sit on the edge of the bed while lowering the legs for another thirty seconds. \"After that series of half minute pauses, you won't likely suffer from insufficient blood circulation to your brain, reducing the possibility of sudden unexpected death.\" We traced the same claim back as far as 2016 and found it did the rounds again in 2019 . Versions of it are posted as a graphic with a picture of a doctor and text. The graphic was also sent to Africa Check on our WhatsApp line. So should you really adhere to the three \"half minute pauses\" rule in order to \"avoid death\" when waking up during the night? We checked. Night-time waking is common Waking up in the middle of the night is normal for human beings, says Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, a private research university in the US. Most people experience mini awakenings , which are not noticeable, and some have observable wake-ups, two to three times per night. Some common causes for waking up during the night include needing to pee, overheating, indigestion, or stress, anxiety and depression. One problem with observable wake-ups is that humans can develop sleep maintenance insomnia , or difficulty getting back to sleep, causing frustration and sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is associated with excessive sleepiness, impaired memory, depression and obesity, and is also linked to some chronic health problems , including kidney and heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. Patients with orthostatic hypotension should always get up slowly Although waking up frequently at night can cause problems, there is no evidence that getting up too quickly could lead to \"sudden unexpected death at night\", as these Facebook posts claim. Dr Bernard Gitura , a cardiologist in Nairobi, Kenya, told AFP Fact Check that the claim has no scientific basis. \"The heart cannot become weakened or the supply of blood in the brain cut short simply from waking up suddenly,\" Gitura told AFP Fact Check. \"This is because the body has a complex mechanism which it uses to regulate blood pressure and flow when one is rising from a sleeping position.\" If you have orthostatic hypotension , also known as postural hypotension, you may feel lightheaded or even faint when getting up, as a result of low blood pressure . Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by dehydration, heart and nervous system conditions, and can be treated by treating these conditions. But it doesn't lead to \"sudden unexpected death\", day or night. There is no evidence for the claim in these fear-mongering social media posts and no need to get up slowly in thirty-second increments for most healthy people.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A new ad claims President Barack Obama broke his promise about the impact of the economic stimulus plan.The ad uses a familiar Republican talking point, that Obama \"promised\" low unemployment if the stimulus was passed. We've checked many claims it would stay below 8 percent, but this ad says it would drop to 5.6 percent.It's a flashy ad from pro-Republican super PAC American Crossroads, using gleaming Minority Report-style graphics manipulated by a narrator in an empty warehouse. The version we've seen still running this week uses an outdated number, saying unemployment is \"actually\" 8.1 percent. The latest monthly report, which came out Friday, says it is now 7.8 percent.In this fact-check, we’re focusing on what Obama said the jobless rate would be if Congress passed a stimulus plan.Separately, we are checking the ad’s claim that \"Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.\"Here’s the full narration: The screen displays the line, \"We can’t afford 4 more years.\" What Obama saidWe asked American Crossroads for material to support the ad. Spokesman Jonathan Collegio referred us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report prepared before Obama took office, and a speech by the president-elect.The report, designed to help Obama argue for an aggressive response to the burgeoning jobs crisis, featured projections for the effect of a stimulus plan.Those estimates include a chart, \"Unemployment Rate With and Without Recovery Plan,\" that displays a post-stimulus jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid 2012, like the chart in the American Crossroads ad.But Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser, also wrote that their estimates were \"subject to significant margins of error,\" and \"considerable uncertainty.\"We’ve previously ruled that the report was not a promise, but a projection, noting its several caveats.How about the president-elect’s speech introducing the report?Here, too, we find it's a stretch to describe it as a promise. It doesn’t get into specific jobless rates, but does talk about projected job gains if a stimulus plan — which Congress had yet to write — were to pass.Collegio pointed out that Obama:• Said the report presented \"what this plan will mean,\" not \"roughly what this plan might mean.\"• Said \"we’ll create jobs\" not \"could create jobs.\"\"Obama did promise it,\" Collegio said.But Obama’s speech first presents the report’s findings as \"projections,\" and later says that a stimulus plan would \"likely\" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, \"we’ll create\" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure.Here’s how he sets it up: And as we mentioned, the report carried Romer and Bernstein’s warnings about the uncertainty of their projections, including that \"the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009. Our rulingAn ad from American Crossroads says, \"This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent.\"But we find that's a stretch. In the evidence the group provided, Obama doesn’t mention that statistic. Rather, he introduced \"projections\" that included a chart showing the jobless rate falling to 5.6 percent under a recovery plan. The report highlighted the estimates’ \"significant margins of error\" and high uncertainty due to a recession that was \"unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\" The economy was, in fact, much worse than economists knew. The chart is now infamous, but it was never pitched as a promise. We rate the statement Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:While it was extensively reported that Indira Gandhi’s time capsule was unearthed by the Janata Party government, its contents still remain a mystery. A black and white photo of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi holding a metal capsule has gone viral on social media with the claim that she had buried secret documents inside the capsule. Those sharing the post on Facebook that on August 15, 1973, Gandhi sealed important public documents inside a metal capsule made of copper and steel and buried it in a well in front of Red Fort. They demanded that this capsule be dug out and the documents are made public. AFWA’s investigation found that while Gandhi had indeed buried a time capsule outside the Red Fort on that very date, it had already been dug out on December 8, 1977, by the then-ruling Janata party government. The viral posts are archived here and here. What is a Time Capsule? A time capsule is a special container usually made of metal that is used to accommodate documents, photographs, and artefacts which have historical relevance. The container is usually made of steel or aluminium which can stand the test of time and prevent the documents from decaying even after thousands of years. The time capsule is then buried deep inside the earth for future generations to unearth and reveal the history of the bygone era. Indira Gandhi’s time capsule On August 15, 1973, Gandhi buried a steel time capsule outside the Red Fort in New Delhi. It was buried at a depth of 32 feet and contained a 10,000-word document. The capsule was to be dug out only after a thousand years. In 1977, the Congress government was overthrown and the Janata Party came to power under the leadership of Morarji Desai. The Janata Party had reportedly promised it would uncover the documents in Gandhi’s time capsule if it came to power. And on December 8, 1977, the Janata Party government dug it out. The secrets While it was extensively reported that Indira Gandhi’s time capsule was unearthed by the Janata Party government, its contents still remain a mystery. Per a 2013 news report, academician and writer Madhu Purnima Kishwar sought information about the time capsule from the Prime Minister’s Office. The PMO, however, reportedly claimed that it had no record of the former Prime Minister’s time capsule project. The Janata Party government never divulged details about the contents of the time capsule. According to some news reports, a few veteran journalists from the era claimed that the accomplishments of Indira Gandhi and her father Jawaharlal Nehru were the contents of the time capsule. However, there is no certainty on the topic. Thus, we concluded that the viral post claiming that PM Modi should unearth and expose the contents of Indira Gandhi’s time capsule is misleading because it has already been dug out by the Janata Party government. (With input from Yash Mittal) --- ENDS --- INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Viral posts urge Indira Gandhi’s 1973 time capsule to be dug out and its contents made public. Conclusion Indira Gandhi's time capsule was already dug out by the Janata Party government in 1977. However, its contents still remain a mystery.

            "[Evidences]:Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vowed to tackle the college affordability crisis if elected president by forgiving student loan debts and making tuition-free college a reality. But a misleading image circulating social media seems to suggest that Warren is partially responsible for the soaring college prices she’s pledging to trim down. The image, which we found online and on Twitter and Facebook, shows a quote attributed to Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall.com, a conservative news website. The quote reads: \"As Elizabeth Warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students, just remember she was paid $400,000 to teach one class.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We traced the quote back to Pavlich, who tweeted it on July 30 during the Democratic primary debates in Detroit. But we wondered whether the substance of her claim was accurate. As Elizabeth Warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students, just remember she was paid $400,000 to teach one class. In short, we found that Warren did make more than $400,000 for her work at Harvard Law School over a two-year span. But it’s wrong to suggest that all she did was teach one class, and the claim leaves out important context about the other work Warren was doing at that time. Pavlich did not respond to a request for comment, but a quick Google search turned up a handful of news reports from 2012 detailing the financial disclosure forms Warren released as part of her first bid for the Senate in Massachusetts. According to those filings, Warren earned $429,981 in salary from Harvard during 2010 and 2011. She also made money from book royalties and consulting fees. Warren spent roughly two decades lecturing at Harvard Law School, where students recognized her with multiple teaching awards, according to the university’s faculty directory. She taught commercial law as a visiting professor for a year before accepting a tenured position in 1995. Generally speaking, university professors — especially at major research institutions like Harvard — are hired not only to teach, but also to do research and be campus leaders. In fact, a 2017 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that, for university professors, \"salaries are determined principally by research output and associated reputation,\" rather than the number of students the professor teaches. Harvard Law School declined to comment, but the university pays professors more than most research universities, with the average salary for full-time professors being $226,394 in 2017, $203,699 in 2011 and $194,136 in 2010, per the Chronicle of Higher Education. Recent tax filings show that Warren’s husband, also a Harvard law professor, earned $402,897 in 2018. According to an archived version of Harvard Law School’s course catalog, Warren taught one class on empirical analysis during the 2010 spring semester, and local and university news reports indicate that she also taught another class on contracts during the 2011 fall semester. In September 2010, former President Barack Obama tapped Warren to temporarily oversee the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency set up in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers from financial tricks. Warren left Harvard to fill this role and did not return to campus until July 2011, meaning she was unavailable to teach during the 2010 fall and 2011 spring semesters. In a statement to PolitiFact, the Warren campaign noted how Warren taught multiple classes during most other semesters. For example, she taught four classes during the 2006-07 academic year, three in 2007-08, and three in 2008-09. But even if Warren taught fewer classes than usual in 2010 and 2011, saying she \"was paid $400,000 to teach one class\" discounts the research she produced that year and in years previous. In 2010, for example, she contributed a chapter to a book on government regulation. It also ignores the fact that Warren stepped aside from teaching for the entire 2010-11 academic year to advise the Obama administration as an expert on bankruptcy. A viral image said Warren \"was paid $400,000 to teach one class.\" Warren earned more than $400,000 for her work as a Harvard Law School professor in 2010 and 2011. Across those two years, she taught two classes, not one.She also left Harvard during the 2010-2011 academic year to advise the government. Plus, her $400,000 salary would have reflected not only her work in the classroom, but also her reputation, her contributions to Harvard as a researcher and her many years at the university.

            "claim [Claim]: Tony Evers “wants to let out between 9,000 and 10,000 more” Wisconsin prisoners\n",
            "[Evidences]:With crime a central focus of the campaign, Republican Tim Michels has been hammering Democratic Gov. Tony Evers on a related issue: parole. Michels has continually pointed out where people were paroled after committing violent crimes – or even committed other crimes after being paroled. At one point, Michels said he’d halt all paroles as governor – which could in some cases violate state law – and called on Evers to do the same. At an Oct. 24, 2022 news conference in West Bend, Michels started out by conflating the parole issue with a goal Evers talked about in 2018 – eventually cutting the prison population in half. \"It’s reckless to let out half the prison population,\" Michels said. \"There’s 21,000 people incarcerated in Wisconsin. (Evers has) let out over 1,000. He wants to let out between 9,000 and 10,000 more.\" Advocates for that goal favor treatment and other resources for nonviolent offenders instead of prison time to reduce racial disparities and overcrowding in Wisconsin prisons. But Evers has not indicated that he would try to accomplish that solely through releasing parolees, as Michels makes it seem. What’s more, there aren’t even enough people in prison eligible for parole to make Michels’ statement accurate. Let’s break this claim down. The instance Michels drew from to make his statement came from a debate during the 2018 Democratic primary, a few months before Evers was elected governor. Evers said that cutting the state’s prison population in half, a goal of the multiracial interfaith organization MICAH, was \"a goal that’s worth accomplishing.\" Evers at the time noted it was a long-term goal and hasn’t placed great emphasis on it since taking office when compared with other priorities. Still, he said what he said. But wanting to reduce the prison population doesn’t necessarily mean wanting to let out half of the people already in prison. Evers’ efforts on prison reform have focused on diversion programs, according to information from spokesperson Britt Cudaback – which would reduce the number of people heading into Wisconsin prisons, cutting the population over time without a flood of people being released. We’ve written about this difference before. Reducing the number of inmates over time isn’t the same as releasing people from prisons immediately. There are other problems with Michels’ statement. For instance, he suggests that Evers is solely in charge of letting people out on parole. But the governor doesn’t have that kind of control over parole releases – Evers appoints the chairperson to the state parole commission, but does not himself make day-to-day parole decisions. (Some paroles are required by law; others are discretionary.) Evers could release people who are incarcerated by commuting their sentences, but he has not done so. In fact, the Wisconsin chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him and the former head of the parole commission in April 2020 to force his administration to commute sentences and let more prisoners out on parole due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Finally, even if Evers had specifically said he wanted to reduce the prison population by releasing half of those in prison, and even if he himself had the power to do so, he wouldn’t be able to free between 9,000 and 10,000 people. That’s because Department of Corrections data from August 2022 showed less than 2,000 of the state’s inmates have parole-eligible offenses. The rest were convicted of crimes on or after Jan. 1, 2000, when the state’s truth-in-sentencing law took effect, which requires all prisoners to serve every day of their sentence. Michels said Evers wants to let out half of those currently incarcerated in Wisconsin prisons. The statement references the fact that the governor has said he wants to reduce the state’s prison population – which could be accomplished by diversion programs and other front-end solutions. Evers has not said he would do so by releasing half of the current prison population – which is impossible on a few fronts. We rate this claim False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: “39% of Americans … 31% of independents ... 17% of Democrats believe the election was rigged.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:As Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, challenged Arizona’s presidential election results on the Senate floor, he claimed that it’s not just Republicans who think the election was \"rigged.\" A sizable percentage of independents and Democrats believed so, too, he claimed. \"Recent polling shows that 39% of Americans believe the election that just occurred was ‘rigged.’ You may not agree with that assessment, but it is nonetheless a reality for nearly half the country,\" said Cruz. \"I would note it is not just Republicans who believe that. 31% of independents agree with that statement. 17% of Democrats believe the election was rigged.\" President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. State election officials and courts have said that allegations from Trump and his allies about fraud in the election are meritless. Congress met in a joint session Jan. 6 to affirm Biden’s victory and count the Electoral College votes, but broke into separate discussions in the House and Senate chambers to consider objections to the tally from Arizona. Cruz’s statement on the Senate floor came before a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, forcing a halt to the constitutional procedure. We checked Cruz’s claim about the percentages of people who believe the election was \"rigged,\" and found it misleading. Cruz made a similar claim in a Jan. 2 statement, citing Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted between Nov. 13-17. The online survey included a sample of 1,346 American adults. The sample included 598 Democrats, 496 Republicans and 149 independents. (Some respondents did not identify as any of the three.) The survey asked respondents to indicate: \"how much you agree or disagree\" with the statement: \"I am concerned that the election is rigged.\" Here are the results: All respondents: Independents: Democrats: Cruz's office said he arrived at the figures in his claim by adding the percentages for \"strongly agree\" and \"somewhat agree.\" But his overall claim is not the most accurate interpretation of the polling results, according to Ipsos. \"Our perspective is that question isn’t a definitive statement that the election was in fact rigged. For that, we use a separate question in the same survey,\" Chris Jackson, an Ipsos pollster, told PolitiFact. The survey also asked: \"What comes close to your view of the 2020 election?\" The choices were \"legitimate and accurate,\" \"the result of illegal voting or election rigging,\" or \"don’t know.\" \"The result of illegal voting or election rigging\" was chosen by 28% all respondents, 20% of independents, and 6% of Democrats. Those figures are much lower than what Cruz cited. For Cruz to back his point, the \"more accurate number to cite\" would be the lower percentages, Jackson said on Twitter. \"And of that 28%, the large, large majority (79%) are Republicans. The plurality get their news from Fox (31%), other sources (18%) or don't follow news (24%), suggesting belief in rigging is a bit circular,\" Jackson tweeted. It’s also worth noting that the poll was done in mid-November, as legal challenges from Trump’s campaign were still ongoing. Other polls about the election phrased their questions differently, but generally, they show that most Americans trusted the results and thought the 2020 election was free and fair. Republicans were less likely to trust the outcome. One poll from the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that \"confidence in the election’s fairness went up among both independents (from 56% to 69%) and Democrats (from 68% to 90%) pre-election to post-election.\" Cruz said 39% of Americans, 31% of independents, and 17% of Democrats \"believe the election was rigged.\" Cruz’s office said his claim is based on a specific poll and the total percentage of respondents who \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" agreed with the statement: \"I am concerned that the election is rigged.\" That doesn’t necessarily mean they thought it was rigged. Another question in the survey asked people more directly about their view of the election. The percentage of people who said the election was \"the result of illegal voting or election rigging\" was much lower than the numbers Cruz cited. Other polls show far greater confidence in the integrity of the election. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. UPDATE, Jan. 6, 7:30 p.m.: This fact-check was updated to incorporate the response from Cruz's office.\n",

            "[Evidences]:The video has been viewed more than 125,000 times after it was shared on Weibo on March 20, 2023. It shows people standing in a field of burnt rubble. The post's caption, written in simplified Chinese characters, translates as: \"According to reports, military aid from Iran to Russia was destroyed by Israel.\" The video was also viewed over 90,000 times alongside a similar false claim in Chinese-language posts on Twitter and Gettr. Iran has supplied attack drones and ammunition for tanks and artillery to Russian forces, despite warnings from G7 leaders against supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine (archived link). However, there were no official reports that Israel launched attacks on Iranian aid convoys to Russia as of May 3, 2023. Iran had accused Israel of attacking a military defence complex in the city of Isfahan in January 2023 but US intelligence officials believed the strike was prompted by Israel's own security concerns and not military exports to Russia, the New York Times reported (archived link). During more than a decade of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its territory, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions. Moreover, a Google reverse search of keyframes found the video in the posts was previously shared by Afghanistan's former finance minister Dr Omar Zakhilwal on his verified Facebook account on February 14, 2021, a year before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine (archived link). Its Pashto-language caption translates as: \"Huge losses to our national businessmen due to the fire (incident) at Islam Qala is a deeply regrettable disaster. In addition to other problems and insecurity in the country that the businessmen are suffering, such incidents can damage business activities at the national level. \"Hope the government will provide necessary assistance to the affected businessmen and shippers.\" Below are screenshot comparisons of the video in the false posts (left) and the video published by Zakhilwal on Facebook (right): Officials said at least 100 oil and gas tankers have been destroyed by the fire near Islam Qala port, Afghanistan's biggest trade crossing with Iran, causing millions of dollars of losses, AFP reported on February 14, 2021 (archived link).

According to reports, the Xbox One forcefully ejected a disc, slicing the teens throat.

            "claim [Claim]: Says \"over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came\" from Wisconsin.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Gov. Scott Walker says he is focused like a laser beam on job creation. He’s promised that Wisconsin will create 250,000 private sector jobs during his four year term.So when a monthly report showed a sharp increase in the number of jobs in June 2011 -- an estimated net increase of 12,900 jobs, or 9,500 if you just consider the private sector -- it got some attention. What’s more, a federal Bureau of Labor Statistics report released earlier in July showed there had been only 18,000 jobs created nationwide in June.(To be sure, the news was not all rosy in the state report: It showed the unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent in June, from 7.4 percent in May.)Walker celebrated the Wisconsin jobs numbers on July 21, 2011, with this tweet: \"In June, there were 18,000 net new jobs in America. In WI, there were 9,500 net new jobs! most since 9/2003.\"Walker made a similar comparison in an interview: \"To have 9,500 net new jobs in the state at a time when the country saw just 18,000 net new jobs all across the country is incredibly good news, and it's driven by the rebirth of tourism in the state.\"Many others echoed the basic message of Walker’s tweet, often adding their own spin. And that’s where numbers -- or at least the use of them -- started to go bad.The state Republican Party issued a news release with this statement: \"Today, we learned that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from our state.\"Three days later, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) said: \"The labor (department) report that came out last week had 18,000 jobs created in the country. But half of them were in Wisconsin, so we must be doing something right.\"Variations of the statement were made by others, including the conservative MacIver Institute, Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), and state Reps. Michelle Litjens (R-Vinland), Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) and Joan Ballweg (R-Markesan).That’s a lot of echoes.But is what’s being shouted accurate? That is, is the state-national comparison a valid one?We started by looking at the other state-by-state reports, released by the federal government at the same time Wisconsin’s numbers were issued.Wisconsin wasn’t at the top.That claim belonged to Texas, with an increase of 32,000 jobs. Numerous other states showed larger job gains than Wisconsin. For instance, California was up 28,800, and our neighbor Minnesota topped Wisconsin with an increase of 13,200 jobs.Obviously, those add up to more than 18,000 jobs added in the country in June. Indeed, if you were to tally all the state reports -- accounting for those with increases and decreases -- you’d wind up with a net monthly increase of 64,900 jobs -- not the originally discussed 18,000. And half of them would have been created in Texas.So, could Texas Gov. Rick Perry accurately claim his state accounted for twice the total of all the jobs created in the nation? That’s illogical at best.What’s going on here?In short, Walker, the state GOP and the others touting the national numbers are making a flawed comparison. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does separate national and state-by-state studies, each with different parameters and margins of error. The agency says it’s wrong to mix the two estimates -- a warning included as a footnote on the documents themselves.Here’s how they put it:\"State estimation procedures are designed to produce accurate data for each individual state. (The bureau) independently develops the national employment series and does not force state estimates to sum to national totals nor vice versa.\"Because each state series is subject to larger sampling and nonsampling errors than the national series, summing them cumulates individual state levels errors and can cause significant distortions at an aggregate level. Due to these statistical limitations, (the bureau) does not compile a ‘sum of states’ employment series and cautions users that such a series is subject to a relatively large and volatile error structure.\"In short, the bureau says you can’t accurately use the individual state jobs reports to make a national comparison. Or even shorter: Don’t do it.Walker addressed the flawed comparisons a few days after the jobs report was released, during a July 26, 2011 appearance in Wausau.\"We made it very clear at our announcement that (our number) was not half of all the jobs out there, though it is an interesting parallel,\" Walker said.In looking back at the various statements, some clearly went further than others -- and further than Walker’s original tweet. Many of the strongest comparisons seem to take the lead from the state GOP, which claimed \"over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from our state.\"As the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes, it is wrong to combine the two sets of numbers to reach this conclusion. After all, by that approach Minnesota, California and Texas could all say the same as the state GOP, which would lead to at least four halves and, apparently, two wholes.This item isn’t on whether the jobs news was good -- clearly it was -- but on how it was presented.We rate the state GOP claim False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Making the rounds online is a fake quote attributed to Lawyer Vic Rodriguez, spokesperson of presidential candidate Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., that claimed the “UniTeam” slate will stop attending debates due to “trauma” caused by a certain “hot-tempered and mud-slinging” senatorial candidate. On March 4, several Facebook (FB) groups and pages spread the manipulated graphic, labelled “satire,” and bore the headline: “WALA NG (SIC) DEBATE PARA SA MGA KANDIDATO NG UNITEAM MAGMULA PRESIDENTE HANGGANG KONSEHAL (No debate for the candidates of UniTeam from the president to councilor).” The statement attributed to Rodriguez read: “Due to traumas experienced by two of our candidates during yesterday’s SENATORIAL DEBATE brought about by a hot-tempered and mud-slinging candidate from the left, our team, the UNITEAM, will no longer participate in any organized debate. All national candidates as well as local candidates of UNITEAM shall no longer participate in any debate starting today.” It was referring to the March 2 senatorial debate organized by Sonshine Media Network International where Partido Lakas ng Masa senatorial bet Luke Espiritu went viral after verbally sparring with fellow candidates Harry Roque and Larry Gadon, who are members of the UniTeam senatorial slate. The statement is fake. No official documents, speeches, statements or legitimate news reports carry the text in the fabricated graphic. In a March 4 press statement, Rodriguez disowned the quote and said “there is no such statement coming from [him] nor the BBM-Sara UniTeam.” He cautioned people to “practice restraint” in spreading lies and misinformation.. “This stunt is part of the continuing ‘gutter politics’ our adversaries have employed against presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos,” he said. The original quote card was taken from a November 2021 FB post published by Partido Federal ng Pilipinas, the party which carries Marcos’ candidacy, where Rodriguez dismissed the disqualification petitions filed against Marcos as “cheap political gimmicks.” The altered graphic was posted by at least 50 FB groups and pages and has garnered more than 5,720 interactions, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.

            "[Evidences]:During an Oct. 11, 2014, debate, Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley -- who are facing off in one of the nation’s most pivotal Senate races -- sparred over the economy. At one point in the debate, Ernst compared \"Washington, D.C., ways\" with \"Iowa values.\" She pointed to \"records of failure coming from this administration, and followers like Congressman Braley, versus our Iowa values and the way we have conducted business in the last four years. With my good supporter, (Republican Gov.) Terry Branstad, we have implemented strong economic policy here in Iowa -- lower taxes, reduced job-killing regulations, and a balanced budget, and we are putting more of our hard-working Iowans back to work with new, good-paying jobs. Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent.\" But we wondered: Is her statistical comparison between Iowa and the United States valid? We took a closer look. (Ernst’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) 'Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States.' On the first part of the claim, Ernst has a point, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal government’s official source of data about personal income. In the most recent quarter for which data is currently available -- the second quarter of 2014 -- personal income in Iowa increased by 2.4 percent over the previous quarter in Iowa. Only three states had faster growth -- Nebraska (2.7 percent), North Dakota (2.7 percent) and Idaho (2.5 percent). But some context serves to undercut the significance of this achievement. The statistics for such short periods of time tend to be \"noisy\" -- that is, the numbers bounce around a lot. As an illustration, let’s look at the statistics for the couple of quarters before the 2.4 percent increase. Moving backward one quarter at a time, personal income growth in Iowa clocked in at -0.6 percent, -0.5 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.0 percent, and -0.2 percent. This paints a very different picture of personal income growth in Iowa. To effectively detect genuine trends, you need to study a longer period of time. Let’s take a look at how Iowa did for full-year periods rather than quarters. Between full-year 2012 and full-year 2013, Iowa had the 18th-highest percentage change in personal income among the 50 states, which is quite a bit weaker than the fourth-place finish Ernst cited. Iowa fared even more poorly between 2011 and 2012, when the state ranked 43rd nationally. This, too, is quite a different picture than the one she painted in the debate. 'Nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years … by 2.7 percent.' Not if you look at median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly wage nationally in 2013 -- the most recent full year available -- was $776, up from $671 in 2008. Once you adjust the 2006 figure for inflation in 2013 dollars, it works out to be $775.37 -- meaning there was basically no change at all between 2006 and 2013. It’s virtually the same if you inflation-adjust the data for 2005 -- there’s no significant change in median weekly earnings between 2005 and 2013. \"What I always say when writing about wage developments, at least after the number of employed Americans started rising again in 2010, is that real wages are basically flat,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Meanwhile, the comparison Ernst offered -- of strong Iowa growth amid national stagnation -- is flawed, for two reasons. • She’s comparing two different statistics. Personal income and real wages aren’t the same thing. Real wages are a component of personal income, but not the only one. They are derived from separate data sources, and they use very different methodologies. • She’s comparing two different periods of time. You can’t simply compare the most recent quarter with the past eight years and get a meaningful contrast. It’s comparing apples and oranges. All this said, Ernst does have a point: Real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years then they have nationally. If you start the clock in 2005, real wages in Iowa increased by 1.6 percent by 2013, and if you start the clock in 2006, they increased by 1.8 percent by 2013. And she also has a point that stagnant real earnings growth over eight years is nothing to be proud of, even if she exaggerates by blaming this situation on Braley. (Lots of factors shape the economy beyond just one minority-party member of Congress.) Our ruling Ernst said that \"Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent.\" Iowa did rank fourth nationally in personal income growth, but only for the most recent quarter, and when compared to earlier quarters, this high rate seems like a statistical anomaly. Meanwhile, she’s wrong that real wages declined by 2.7 percent over the past eight years, although she does have a point that Iowa did somewhat better on this score than did the nation as a whole. Equally problematic, Ernst’s comparison between Iowa’s economy and the nation’s is questionable because it appears to compare quarterly data for one statistic to eight years of a different statistic. Economists say this isn’t a sound method. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:This was stated by an ex-employee of the CIA, who worked for the agency until 2015, and at the moment is an avid opponent of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. The Pentagon has made no such statements. Such “losses” are not confirmed by the inspections that the US Defense Department of Defense periodically conducts in Ukraine. Kremlin media write that the United States allegedly lost 90% of the US weapons supplied to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This “sensational statement” was made by former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright on FirstTV. Tsargrad quotes Wright as saying, “This is according to the Pentagon. They did a little research on the ground, figuring out where the weapons went. 10% can be confirmed to be in Ukraine. The other 90%, we can only hope so.” There is no way Bryan Wright could have access to “declassified” Pentagon data, as he has long had nothing to do with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). According to his Linkedin profile , Wright worked for the CIA first from 2001 to 2006 and then from 2013 to 2015. He is currently the host of his podcast, “President’s Daily Brief,” in which he expresses his opinions on US domestic and foreign policy, often criticizing current US President Joe Biden. Brian Wright also periodically appears on national American channels, as a “former CIA officer” commenting on various events. As for Ukraine, Wright previously spoke against its support and arms transfers and called Russia “a great war machine.” His words were repeatedly used by Russian propaganda channels. Appearing on FirstTV,  Wright repeated the same thing that he said on other platforms – that the US supposedly knows only about the fate of 10% of the weapons that were sent to Ukraine,  as for the rest – “fingers crossed they don’t end up in the wrong hands.” Nevertheless, his opinion is not some “declassification of data” or a Pentagon position, because, again, Wright has nothing to do with the U.S. Defense Department. Officially, the U.S DOD has not made any such statements. For its part, the Pentagon conducts inspections to check weapons storage sites “whenever and wherever the security conditions allow,” and in October, a senior US Defense Department official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the Ukrainian government has made a commitment to secure and account for the weapons, and there is no credible evidence that the DOD were deceived. Russian propaganda has repeatedly tried to find evidence that Western arms supplied to Ukraine are allegedly stolen and sold off to other countries, but each time such lies have failed.

            "claim [Claim]: The 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches \"are going up.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s seating on the Supreme Court followed one of the most bitter and divisive confirmation fights in the High Court’s history. Some legal commentators suggested that, in addition to questions of Kavanaugh’s personal history and judicial temperament, the Supreme Court’s own internal dynamics helped intensify the fight over the vacant seat. \"One of the reasons I think we fight so hard is you look at the number of 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches. Those are going up,\" said Yale Law professor Stephen Carter. \"The more those decisions go up, the more valuable each seat is, each vacancy.\" There may be a public perception that 5-4 decisions are up, perhaps owing to blockbuster rulings in recent years on everything from health care to voting rights to political spending that were decided by this slimmest of margins. It’s also possible that Kavanaugh could cast deciding votes on cases with major implications for American society. But the data shows that 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. We reached out to Carter, who said he’d misspoken. \"Mea culpa. I do know better,\" he said of his Oct. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. \"When I talk about this subject to students and colleagues, I usually refer to the perception that there are lots of 5-4 decisions as the driver of perceived value of each vacancy.\" To be sure, many high profile cases have been decided on a 5-4 basis in recent years. The most recent term also had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, there’s no discernible long-term upward trend, according to a SCOTUSBlog analysis of past 13 terms, as well as interviews with Supreme Court watchers: \"I don’t think there’s a particular trend there,\" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"I don’t think it’s accurate to say that the rate of 5-4 decisions is increasing.\" Not all cases the justices hear are equal, of course. Each year, some cases carry greater potential impact and public interest than others. Experts told us that when charting the relative frequency of 5-4 decisions over time, there’s no objective way to separate the (for lack of better term) major cases from minor cases. However, Sara Benesh, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, said blockbuster cases do tend to produce less consensus than minor ones. But that’s nothing new, she said. \"It is true that ‘big,’ controversial cases are more likely to be decided 5-4 than more ‘routine’ cases,\" she said. \"But that has been true over time as well.\" Oftentimes those divisions break along familiar ideological lines. Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee, addressed the Court’s voting breakdown in a recent speech. She said the Court’s relatively high frequency of 9-0 opinions is underappreciated, but acknowledged that big cases often do produce more disagreement. \"There are some issues — some important issues that people care about — in which the court is more closely divided and tends to be divided along lines that you might predict, if you look at who nominated each of us,\" she said. I transcribed the entirety of Justice Elena Kagan's answer about the Supreme Court and institutional legitimacy because I think it's important. pic.twitter.com/BzEbXF5Z9T Overall, the rate of 9-0 decisions have outnumbered the rate of 5-4 decisions in recent years, according to Sarah Turberville of the government watchdog groupProject on Government Oversight, who provided the following chart: \"It’s not entirely accurate to say 5-4 decisions have increased,\" Turberville said. \"Yes, there was an increase from 2016 to 2017, but there was also an increase in 9-0 decisions over that course of time.\" Carter said that the 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches \"are going up.\" The most recent Supreme Court term had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, the data since at least 2005 shows 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. Carter himself said he misspoke, and meant to say there was a perception that such cases were on the rise. We rate this False. \n",

            "[Evidences]:Pro and con, about a dozen speakers came forward last month when the House of Delegates Commerce and Labor Committee invited comment on bills to raise Virginia’s minimum wage. Robin Gahan, the director of programs at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, urged an increase, saying families can’t get by on the bottom rate of $7.25 an hour, which is also the national floor. \"In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage could actually support a family of three above the poverty line,\" Gahan said. \"Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two.\" The Republican-controlled committee went on to kill three bills this winter that would have increased the minimum wage, maintaining that raising the rate would force employers to cut jobs. But the issue remains alive in Washington, where the U.S. Senate this spring is expected to vote on legislation that would raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. So we looked into the Interfaith Center’s claim. Gahan pointed us to a December 2013 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that advocates boosting the wage. A graph measures the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels. In 1968, the minimum wage for most workers was $1.60 an hour. An employee working at that rate for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have earned $3,328. That was above the poverty thresholds that year for a three person-household: $2,817 annually for a home headed by a man and $2,516 for a home headed by a woman. The minimum wage was bifurcated back then, however, and a small group of employees -- including workers at schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels and motels -- could be paid as little as $1.15 an hour. Those employees, working full time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household. Congress ended the dual minimum wages in 1978. Now, let’s move forward to modern times. The $7.25 hourly minimum was established in 2009. A full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year. That falls slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two, which is $15,156. There are a few details about all these numbers that should be noted: Our ruling There’s a slight snag in the first part of the Virginia Interfaith Center’s claim that, in 1968, a full- time minimum wage earner could support a household of three above the poverty line. The wage was bifurcated then. The majority earning $1.60 an hour could support a family of three, but a small group of workers qualifying for $1.15 an hour would have lived below the poverty line The second part of the center’s claim -- that a full-time worker today could not raise a family of two on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour -- holds up. Clearly, the buying power of the minimum wage has decreased in recent decades. The center tried to illustrate that point with a statement that is accurate but needs a little clarification. So we rate its claim Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000-7,000 jobs per month\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:There has been a renewed focus on jobs and how many the economy has lost as Republicans and Democrats continue to do battle and threat of a government shutdown looms. Recently a political commentator took to Twitter highlighting job losses since across-the-board, automatic federal budget cuts -- known as sequestration -- took effect March 1. \"Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000 to 7,000 jobs per month,\" the Political Line Twitter post said. If Political Line’s claim is correct, that would mean between 30,000 and 35,000 federal jobs have been lost for the five months, through August, that the sequester has been in effect. That type of possible job loss had us intrigued, so we decided to follow the numbers. PolitiFact Georgia emailed Political Line and visited its website for more information about the claim and about the author but received no response to our requests. Political Line is a political blog of postings on a variety of national topics from health care to drug policy, along with an aggregation of news stories. Under sequestration, the federal government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. As a previous PolitiFact sequestration fact check noted, putting money into the economy does create jobs, and less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run. There have been numerous reports of the sequester’s impact, including departments limping along on tight budgets, employees forced to take unpaid furlough days and Head Start students being cut from the rolls. And this week, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray blamed the horrific Navy Yard shooting on the sequester. When asked by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo how shooter Aaron Alexis, who was being treated for mental health issues, was still able to get access to areas that he probably shouldn’t have had, Gray responded: \"As I look at, for example, sequestration, which is about saving money in the federal government being spent, have we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk,\" Gray said on CNN’s \"New Day\" the morning after the shooting. Those accounts have provided anecdotal evidence about sequestration’s impact. But when it comes to the actual number of jobs lost to sequestration, we really just don’t know, said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow and federal budget policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. \"There isn’t anyone, including (the federal Office of Management and Budget), that has gone agency by agency and says what did you do, and how did you do it, and say how many jobs were lost,\" Lilly said. As for Political Line’s claim, with millions of federal employees, the 6,000-7,000 monthly job loss is statistically not a big thing, Lilly said. \"You could lose that many with just inaccurate or inconsistent reporting. It makes sense to me.\" With no official analysis, numbers from multiple studies and financial reports have been used to detail sequester job cuts. In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 750,000 more full-time jobs would be created in the U.S. economy by the end of the year without sequestration. A Goldman Sachs study, released this month, noted that the sequestration could end up costing another 100,000 federal jobs in the next few quarters, and that federal jobs have declined by 71,000 since last year. To get a more accurate count, we reviewed month-to-month federal government employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from March 2013 (when sequestration began) through August, the most recent data available. Month All federal employees Month-to-month change Federal employees, minus postal workers Month-to-month change March 2,762,000 2,173,400 April 2,777,000 15,000 2,169,000 (4,400) May 2,757,000 (20,000) 2,168,200 (800) June 2,761,000 4,000 2,172,100 3,900 July 2,753,000 (8,000) 2,162,000 (10,100) August 2,752,000 1,000 2,162,100 (100) The BLS data showed that federal employment varied from month to month. Some months saw job losses exceeding Political Line’s claim of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs lost; but other months saw job gains. So what about Political Line’s claim? The political blogger said in a Twitter post that since sequestration, federal government jobs have decreased 6,000-7,000 jobs a month. There has been no official analysis of jobs lost to the sequester. There is anecdotal evidence that the budget cuts have hurt the federal sector, but at the same time, there have been job gains -- albeit marginal -- in the private sector. Using the best data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the numbers show that some months federal job losses reached and exceeded Political Line’s claim, but in other months, the losses were much less, and there were even job gains. Political Line’s statement contains an element of truth, but it needs clarification and additional information. Reviewing the data over the previous 12 months does show an overall downward trend in federal government jobs, but the monthly totals fluctuate. And overall the job reduction is far less than the statement would indicate. We rate it Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:President Donald Trump, seeking to discredit the investigation into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia, claimed without evidence that thousands of text messages exchanged between former FBI officials were deliberately erased. Trump also said the text messages, between former agent Peter Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page, would have exposed Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe as a hoax, had they not been \"purposely and illegally deleted.\" Here is Trump’s tweet: \"Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!\" Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest! There are some major factual problems with Trump’s claim, we found. First, a new report from the Justice Department’s internal watchdog suggests the roughly 19,000 messages slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI’s data-collection tool on Samsung devices, not because Strzok and Page went around the system. Second, perhaps most importantly, while the messages were initially not captured, they have since been recovered. Trump’s claim gives the false impression the texts are still unaccounted. In fact, at least a portion of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some messages between Strzok and Page were published by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General in a June 2018 report. The inspector general was unable to recover text messages Strzok and Page may have sent using iPhones they were given when they joined Mueller’s team. But a special counsel official who reviewed Strzok’s iPhone before it was reset found it contained no substantive messages. There is no evidence the text messages show the special counsel investigation is a \"hoax.\" We reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back Following the 2016 election, the Justice Department’s internal watchdog looked into whether the FBI followed protocol when it investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. It published its findings in a June 2018 report. As part of its inquiry, the Office of Inspector General collected texts exchanged between Strzok and Page, some of which showed hostility toward Trump and a preference for Clinton. (Strzok was later fired from from the FBI and Page has since left.) The inspector general discovered a five-month gap in the Strzok-Page communications, from mid-December 2016 through mid-May 2017. This prompted the inspector general to conduct a follow-on report to supplement its June 2018 findings. The follow-on report, which further described the inspector general’s forensic efforts to recover the missing Strzok-Page texts, was released Dec. 13. The inspector general found no evidence Strzok and Page tried to prevent the FBI from collecting their texts. The watchdog’s findings suggest the most likely reason the texts weren’t captured had to do with technical flaws in the FBI’s data-collection process, not deliberate wrongdoing. It concluded: \"The OIG investigation determined that the FBl's collection tool was not only failing to collect any data on certain phones during particular periods of time, it also does not appear that it was collecting all text messages even when it was generally functioning to collect text messages.\" FBI tech specialists cited a number of possible explanations for the text-collection breakdown, from a 2016 software bug, to misconfiguration during the phone’s setup to a range of possible hardware errors, according to the inspector general report. The collection tool had an estimated failure rate of 20 percent when used with FBI-issued Samsung S5 mobile devices. Both Strzok and Page used the S5 model during the five-month gap, the report found. Only later in mid-2017 were they issued S7 models \"as part of a regular technical refresh and to address issues with the FBl’s text message collection tool,\" according to the inspector general. An outside expert hired by the inspector general to assist with the Samsung portion of the investigation concluded \"it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,\" and the watchdog found no evidence they did. The inspector general also found the \"content of the text messages did not appear to be a factor\" in the retention practices of Strzok and Page. Separately from their Samsung devices, the two officials were issued Apple iPhones when they began working as members of the special counsel investigation. By the time the inspector general obtained their Apple phones, they had been reset to factory settings so they could be reassigned, and contained no data related to the previous owner’s use, the report states. The special counsel records officer told the inspector general that she reviewed Strzok's DOJ-issued iPhone after he returned it to the special counsel \"and determined it contained no substantive text messages.\" (Upon her departure from the FBI, Page left her iPhone in her office, rather than return it to the special counsel records officer.) Trump’s tweet seems to suggest the Strzok-Page texts are gone forever — hence why Trump laments that they \"would have\" exonerated him. But this overlooks the fact that the inspector general managed to recover thousands of messages that were initially not collected because of the technical snafu described above. \"OIG digital forensic examiners used forensic tools to recover thousands of text messages\" from the Samsung S5 devices of Strzok and Page, the report notes. Forensic experts recovered more than 9,300 texts sent or received from Strzok's S5 phone, about 8,300 of which were sent to or received from Page. They also collected 10,760 texts from Page’s S5 device, about 9,700 of which were communications with Strzok. It’s impossible to say with precision how many unique texts were recovered. That’s because some are duplicates, and because the inspector general nabbed some message fragments that did not have an associated date or time, and these were not included in the inspector general’s calculation. They also recovered texts from a separate database which added marginally to the overall number of texts the inspector general recovered. Trump’s reference to 19,000 texts appears to be the result of adding the total texts recovered from Strzok’s and Page’s S5 phones together. But his suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered a total of more than 126,000 lines of text from Strzok and Page. At least a portion of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some messages between Strzok and Page were published in the inspector general’s June 2018 report on the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation. Trump said 19,000 text messages exchanged between former FBI officials that were \"purposely and illegally deleted ... would have explained (the special counsel investigation) hoax.\" The Justice Department inspector general’s report suggests the texts slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI’s data-collection tool, not because Strzok and Page deliberately deleted them. An outside expert hired by the inspector general concluded \"it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,\" and the watchdog found no evidence they did. Trump’s suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered more than 19,000 messages from the government-issued Samsung phones of Strzok and Page, totaling more than 126,000 lines of text. And lastly, there is no evidence the texts show that the special counsel investigation is, as Trump called it, a \"hoax.\" We rate this claim Pants on Fire. \n",

            "[Evidences]:\"Thousands of foreign Chinese citizens were given ID cards for the 2024 elections,\" read the caption of this Facebook post, dated January 8, 2023. The post also shared a video of a man reading an article published by Populis, an Indonesian political news site that regularly posts clickbait, on January 7, 2023. It is headlined: \"Imam of Mosque in New York Shakes His Head Seeing Thousands of Foreign Chinese Citizens Given ID cards for 2024 Elections, OMG!\" The man in the video points at the photo on the article and says: \"Look, those are the ID cards... so many!\" The two-minute, 20-second footage has been viewed more than 530 times. The Populis article references Shamsi Ali, an Indonesian imam and chairman of the Al-Hikmah Mosque in New York, who tweeted a misleading video on January 5, 2023, with a similar claim, that Indonesia had issued thousands of electronic ID cards -- known as e-KTP -- to Chinese citizens. Days later, Shamsi Ali tweeted that he shared the claim because he was \"surprised\" hearing it. The claims circulated as Indonesia is gearing up for the 2024 elections, which would vote not only lawmakers but also the country's president and vice president. The video also circulated alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, on Twitter here and here and on YouTube here -- garnering more than 800 views. Both the clip, which was originally uploaded on video-sharing app SnackVideo, and the Populis article, included a denial from the government. However, comments from some social media users indicated they believed the claim. One Facebook user wrote: \"The regime is ignorant and don't want to lose, they have already planned to scheme and cheat,\" while a SnackVideo user commented: \"this is a way to win the 2024 elections.\" But the claim is false. A reverse-image search on Google found the photo in the Populis article and the misleading video does not show ID cards issued to Chinese citizens. The photo of the ID cards was published in a 2018 report from Indonesia's state-run news agency Antara about the arrests of civil registry officials who collected illegal ID card fees in Jember, a city in East Java province. The photo's caption partly reads: \"A police officer shows electronic ID cards and children's ID cards during the media briefing on the arrests related to the case of illegal fees imposed on identity documents, at Jember Police Headquarters, East Java, Friday, November 2, 2018.\" Screenshot comparison of the photo in the Populis article (left) and the genuine photo from Antara (right): According to the Indonesian General Elections Commission's regulations, eligible voters need to be Indonesian citizens who either have reached at least 17 years of age, have married or were married. Zudan Arif Fakrulloh, director general of Indonesia's population and civil registry, has debunked the false claim in a video he posted on his official TikTok account on January 11, 2023. \"The Population and Civil Registry Agency has never issued electronic ID cards for foreign citizens for elections because foreign citizens cannot take part in elections, because one needs to be an Indonesian citizen in order to vote,\" he said in the video. In the TikTok video, Zudan said that as of January 2023, a total of 16,915 electronic ID cards had been issued to foreign nationals. That was an increase of nearly 30 percent from the 13,056 ID cards issued to foreign nationals, as of March 2022. Based on the March 2022 figures, South Koreans were the largest group with electronic ID cards (1,227), followed by Japanese (1,057) and Australians (1,006). Citizens from China (909) are in fifth place behind the Netherlands (961). \"Giving an electronic ID card to a foreigner is not an easy process. We have very restricted requirements,\" Zudan told AFP. \"We can only issue it to a foreigner holding Permanent Stay Permits (KITAP) from the Immigration Office.\" KITAP allows foreign citizens to stay for five years at a time. According to Indonesian Law No. 6/2011 on Immigration, KITAP can be granted to: foreign nationals holding a Temporary Stay Permit (KITAS) as clerics, workers, investors and the elderly; a family member of a mixed nationality marriage; the husband, wife, and/or children of a foreign national holding a KITAP; and a foreign national who used to have Indonesian citizenship. Zudan also dismissed concerns that foreign citizens could still use their electronic ID cards on Election Day. \"The colours are different,\" he told AFP -- pointing out that since 2022, electronic ID cards for foreign citizens are orange-coloured, while for adult Indonesian citizens it's blue. \"For Indonesian citizens, their electronic ID cards are valid for life, but for foreigners the validity period is limited. The information on their ID cards is also written in English, and there is also information about their country of origin,\" Zudan added. \"The local poll administrators could definitely tell them apart.\" He shared what the ID cards look like in his TikTok video. Below are screenshots from Zudan's TikTok video, which shows an electronic ID card for a foreign citizen (left) and another for an Indonesian citizen (right): The back side of the ID cards can be seen on the website of the Population and Civil Registry Agency in Denpasar, Bali: the one for a foreign citizen is at the top while the other for an Indonesian citizen at the bottom: AFP also debunked a similar false claim that circulated ahead of the 2019 elections. At that time, the Home Affairs Ministry issued a statement that foreigners who were legally required to have an electronic ID cards did not have the right to vote or be elected.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Advertisment: About this rating On March 7, 2023, a Facebook post claimed that the movie \"Some Like It Hot\" was banned in Tennessee. When Snopes readers emailed us about the claim, we looked into it and found insufficient evidence to rate it true or false, so we have rated the claim \"Unproven\" for now. \"Banned in Tennessee: Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot (1959),\" The Other 98%, an organization dedicated to winning the \"battle of the story\" using viral original political content, posted on its Facebook page. \"Some Like It Hot\" is a 1959 classic movie about two men who disguise themselves as part of an all-female jazz band to escape the mob. We reached out to The Other 98% for comment, but did not receive a response. We found the same claim repeated a number of times on Twitter, as well as on Instagram. However, it's unclear whether legislation recently passed in Tennessee would result in that film, or others like it, like \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" being banned. Tennessee passed legislation on March 2 that banned gender-affirming care for transgender minors. On the same day, the bill restricting \"adult cabaret performances\" in public or in the presence of children was passed. That bill defined \"adult cabaret performances\" as: SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-51-1401, is amended by adding the following language as a new subdivision:\"Adult cabaret performance\" means a performance in a location other than an adult cabaret that features topless dancers, go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest, or similar entertainers, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-51-1407, is amended by adding the following language as a new subsection: It is an offense for a person to engage in an adult cabaret performance: (A) On public property; or (B) In a location where the adult cabaret performance could be viewed by a person who is not an adult. The law goes into effect on July 1, 2023. Violating it once will carry a misdemeanor charge punishable of $2,500 and/or up to a year in jail. For every violation afterwards, it would be a felony charge that could be punishable with up to six years in prison. The phrase \"appeals to a prurient interest\" came from a 1973 Supreme Court case about obscenity, Miller v. California. The case ruled one of the guidelines for jurors ruling on obscenity cases should be whether the average person applying community standards would find the work had a morbid, degrading, and unhealthy interest in sex. While analyzing the impact the legislation could have, the Tennessean wrote, \"So while one governing body might believe drag performances aren't obscene or harmful to minors, another might believe differently based on \"contemporary community standards.\" Based on the context, \"adult cabaret performances\" might be interpreted to mean \"live performances\" only. It can also be argued popular mainstream films like \"Some Like It Hot\" or \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" do not \"appeal to the prurient interest.\" When Snopes reached out to the main sponsors of the legislation, Rep. Chris Todd and Sen. Jack Johnson, for clarification on the status of such films, we did not receive response in time for publication.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Defending his fiscal policies and collective bargaining limits during the final debate before the June 5, 2012 recall vote, Gov. Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list.\"We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home,\" Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School.Is his claim on the money?Walker’s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those reports show an upward trend in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent.This leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget’s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy.In preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker’s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- announced in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop.To be sure, that doesn’t mean every homeowner’s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes.While Walker’s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down.The reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property.The Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration’s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau’s property tax program supervisor.So, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix.But the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000. And he made it clear he was talking about just residential property.We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Technology coming to Virginia allows COVID-19 personal protection equipment to be “decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading performance.”\n",
            "[Evidences]:Gov. Ralph Northamannounced that Virginia has received decontamination systems that will help provide front-line health workers with protective equipment against COVID-19. Each of the systems can massively sanitize for reuse much-sought-after N95 face masks. The systems were developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio, and received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been sending the equipment, free of charge, to various locations. Northam announced during a May 1 news conference that Virginia has gotten three of the systems, to be located in Chesterfield County, Newport News and Blacksburg. \"These systems have multiple units that are each the size of a storage container and can clean up to 80,000 masks per day using a hydrogen peroxide vapor,\" Northam said. \"(Personal protective equipment) can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\" Traditionally, N95 masks have been designated for only single use. So we fact-checked Northam’s statement that the system allows the masks to be \"decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\" The Battelle process Hospitals send the masks to N95 sanitization centers Battelle has helped set up, including in coronavirus hot spots such as New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. Battelle says the masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times. But, as PolitiFact National recently noted, that’s not a best practice. The FDA, in its letter designating emergency approval, specified that Battelle’s decontamination system \"may be effective\" safely recycling masks 20 times, but it advised that recycling should only be done \"when there are insufficient supplies.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\" There are several reasons. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it’s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"Decontamination is a complicated process,\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research.\" N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle’s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask’s filtration. Mask integrity Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95Decon report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator’s fit. \"If [an N95] doesn’t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn’t matter how good a filter it is,\" said Patrick Kenney, medical director of the Yale-New Haven Health’s corporate supply chain. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected ― since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard — and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle’s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. We should note the PolitiFact Nationalfact-checked an April 23 statement by President Trump. He said, \"We’re also using a sterilization process ― some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks.\" PolitiFact rated the statement Half-True, saying, \"Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as ‘ordering 20 times more masks.’\" Our ruling Northam said with decontamination systems being set up in Virginia, \"PPE can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\" The systems are excellent news for Virginia which, like practically all states, has struggled to acquire N95 masks for medical workers. But the governor’s words are still rosy. The FDA, in its letter of emergency approval, said the decontamination system \"may be effective\" safely recycling masks up to 20 times, but warned the process should only be used when there are \"insufficient (new) supplies.\" Some early research suggests the structure of the masks may be compromised through the repeated process, making them less-secure fits on faces. So Northam’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. \n",

            "[Evidences]:December 2018 saw the arrival of a new wrinkle in the so-called “War on Christmas,” namely the claim that conservative-leaning entertainers were holding fundraising activities to help save the holiday from annihilation by Christmas-hating liberals. Specifically, according to a 6 December article on the consistently misinformative America’s Last Line of Defense (LLOD) website, Detroit rock-and-rollers Ted Nugent and Kid Rock together raised more than $10 million for the cause: Kid Rock and Ted Nugent have just finished off their charity tour to raise money to fight the War on Christmas. Nugent and Rock, whose real name is Louie, say the money they raise will go first and foremost to the community in and around their hometown of Detroit. Fellow Lions fan and expert on Motown, Art Tubolls, told Rolling Stone: “These two are battling the forces of evil in Michigan. People here openly worship Moon Gods and practice Shania Law. The money they raise will go to festive coffee cups for local shops who can’t afford to say ‘Merry Christmas’ or the liberals who buy that crap will put them out of business. They allocated more than $2 million for garland alone for Dearborn. They also have no turkeys or beef available for dinner on the West side of Kalamazoo. Now, with the help of these true Christians, places where Christmas was nearly forgotten are suiting up their mall Santas and putting the Salvation Army Bellringers back to work.” However, neither entertainer announced their participation in such a tour (before or after it was supposedly completed), nor did any such report appear in the pages of Rolling Stone. The so-called “expert on Motown” quoted above, Art Tubolls, exists nowhere except on the pages of LLOD, which frequently cites that name, along with a constantly rotating set of credentials, whenever an expert source is required for quotation purposes. The network of websites and social media accounts comprising LLOD publishes fictional stories with clickbait headlines calculated to attract likes and shares for their politically divisive content. Their “About Us” page describes that content as “satire”: Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. As to the “War on Christmas,” any funds currently being raised in the interests of defending the supposedly embattled holiday ought to be regarded as superfluous. Sometime conservative icon and Christmas warrior Bill O’Reilly declared the war over during a segment of his Fox News Channel show in 2006. According to O’Reilly, Christmas won.\n",

The report stated that it was because a new vulnerability had been discovered which might allow hackers to target someone by simply sending a malicious video file via WhatsApp. BOOM reached out to Rahul Sasi, an Indian entrepreneur, security expert, and white-hat hacker who said that this was possible, however, stated that the bug had been fixed by WhatsApp. \"Technically speaking its a fixed bug, that means WhatsApp is not vulnerable to this anymore,\" Sasi said. On the preventive steps that WhatsApp users could take Sasi told BOOM that, \"There is no specific way we could detect an exploit attempt of this sort, but one should always keep the recent updates on the phone.\" Other instances of WhatsApp spyware hack include in May 2019, when Financial Times had reported a vulnerability in the older version of the app that allowed attackers to inject spywares on phones through a simple in-app missed call. A select number of WhatsApp users phones were infected by a sophisticated government-grade spyware, with human rights activists being reported as prime targets. The spyware used to infect the phones through missed in-app calls on WhatsApp had been identified as Pegasus, made by an Israeli cyber intelligence company called NSO Group. WhatsApp had then put out a statement that acknowledged the threat in its older versions and encouraged its users to update their apps. Also Read: WhatsApp Spyware Hack: Should You Be Worried?\n",

            "[Evidences]:As Michigan continued to count ballots in the presidential race, social media posts claimed that ballots were cast in the names of dead people. \"118-year-old William Bradley voted via an absentee ballot in Wayne County, Michigan this year. William died in 1984. They’re trying to steal this election,\" stated a Facebook postby Ryan Fournier, founder of Students for Trump. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Screengrabs on social media showed a Detroit registered voter, William Bradley, with a date of birth in March 1902 and a date of death in June 1984. We entered his name in the state’s voter information website and found that he was listed as a registered voter. The state website showed that a ballot was sent to Bradley in September and received back Oct. 2. A city official said that no ballot was cast on behalf of the dead voter. William Bradley is a potentially common name. We found another William Bradley in the same zip code and spoke to him on the telephone Nov. 5. Bradley told us that he shares the same name as his father who died in 1984, except he has the middle name of Tarnell. He told us that he lives in the same home where his father used to live. Bradley told us that he voted by mail due to the pandemic. He said that a ballot arrived for his dead father, but he threw that out. \"I didn’t use it, because I didn’t want to get it confused with mine,\" he said. Bradley said that someone on Nov. 5 called him and told him there was a report all over the internet about this situation, so he called the city about it. A city official told him not to worry, because officials check for a matching signature and date of birth, he told us. We put Bradley’s name with his date of birth through the same state website. It showed that he is a registered voter and it showed his application for an absentee ballot was received in July, but it showed no ballot sent or received. Daniel Baxter, a consultant for the Detroit Department of Elections, sent us a statement that explained what happened: \"No ballot for the 118-year-old Mr. Bradley was ever requested, received or counted. A man with a nearly identical name requested a ballot and voted properly in both the primary and general elections. When his ballot was initially logged, however, it was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago through a clerical error.\" Tracy Wimmer, spokesperson for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, told us that on rare occasions a ballot can be recorded inaccurately if names are identical, creating the impression that a ballot was cast in a dead voter’s name. \"This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr; or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file; for example, someone born in 1990 accidentally recorded as born in 1890,\" Wimmer said. \"In such scenarios, no one ineligible has actually voted, and there is no impact on the outcome of the election. Local clerks can correct the issue when it is brought to their attention.\" We have fact-checked many misleading claims about dead people on the voter rolls this year including in Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin. A Facebook post said \"118-year-old William Bradley voted via an absentee ballot in Wayne County, Michigan this year. William died in 1984. They’re trying to steal this election.\" A city elections official said that no ballot was cast for the now deceased Bradley. The official said that a man with a nearly identical name (Bradley’s son) voted in the election; however, when his ballot was initially logged it was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago. This was a clerical error, not voter fraud. This statement rates False. PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

            "[Evidences]:At the economic summit for Republican presidential candidates convened by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States. \"For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting,\" Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event. Is that correct? We took a closer look. We located a May 2014 report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, \"Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros.\" In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubio’s claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics. \"Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time,\" they wrote. They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. \"The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing,\" the authors wrote. Here’s the kicker from the report: \"Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data,\" the authors wrote. Here’s a graph showing the trend line: Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so it’s not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasn’t twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubio’s claim is accurate. \"It’s true,\" Litan told PolitiFact, adding, \"We haven’t reversed this yet.\" As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, \"it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy --whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.\" Our ruling Rubio said that \"for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting.\" The change didn’t happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tank’s report. The co-author of that report said he feels Rubio has stated the claim accurately. We rate Rubio’s claim True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: “coronavirus itself is responsible for just 6% of all deaths listed as coronavirus-related”, the others are “due to pre-existing comorbidities”\n",
            "[Evidences]:CLAIM “coronavirus itself is responsible for just 6% of all deaths listed as coronavirus-related”, the others are “due to pre-existing comorbidities” more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: OANN editors, One America News Network, 27 Mar. 2021 DETAILS Flawed reasoning: Because 94% of COVID-19 death certificates listed contributing health conditions, the author of the claim incorrectly reasoned that only 6% of the deaths attributed to COVID-19 were actually caused by the disease. However, the contributing conditions listed on the death certificate can also be caused by COVID-19 itself, While others, like obesity, wouldn’t have been fatal in themselves. Misleading: The underlying cause of death is the trigger for the events leading to death. These events are concluded by the immediate cause of death. The claim misleadingly overlooked the fact that a death from cardiac arrest (immediate cause) can be the consequence of COVID-19 (underlying cause). KEY TAKE AWAY Underlying cause of death is defined as a medical condition that triggers a chain of clinical events that leads to the death of a patient. Contributing medical conditions can either be a consequence of that underlying cause of death or a pre-existing condition that weakens a patient’s resistance to injuries or diseases and indirectly contributes to their death. COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death in the large majority of recorded COVID-19 related deaths. FULL CLAIM: “coronavirus itself is responsible for just 6% of all deaths listed as coronavirus-related”, the others are “due to pre-existing comorbidities”; “28,000 died from cardiac arrest, yet all of these [...] were marked down as died from the coronavirus.” REVIEW The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the U.S. since early 2020 and caused nearly 31 million identified cases and 560,000 deaths in the country, and 2.9 million deaths worldwide, as of April 2021. Intensive care units being critically overwhelmed in several U.S. counties and the excess mortality in 2020 compared to previous years illustrate the toll of this respiratory disease on the population. However, recurring misinformation has attempted to minimize the extent of the health threat by casting doubt on the COVID-19 death toll. This is the case of this claim relayed by One America News Network (OANN) that “the coronavirus itself is responsible for just 6% of all deaths listed as coronavirus related”, the others being “due to pre-existing comorbidities”. To support its claim, OANN quoted numbers from Table 3 in this webpage (Table 3) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the CDC. This aforementioned document from the CDC lists the additional “conditions contributing to deaths” on death certificates where COVID-19 is mentioned. Based on this report, OANN concluded that all the patients listed as having a contributing condition should have been listed as having died from that condition, and not from COVID-19. For instance: “28,000 died from cardiac arrest, yet all of these […] were marked down as died from the coronavirus”.#. This reasoning is flawed as it conflates the immediate cause of death, the underlying cause of death, and comorbidities and misrepresents how cause of death is determined. A similar claim made by Donald Trump in August 2020 was previously debunked by Health Feedback. In its guidelines, the CDC explains that the underlying cause of death is “the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death”. Part I of the U.S. standard death certificate clearly separates this underlying cause of death from the immediate cause of death. The immediate cause of death is the last event that directly caused the patient’s demise, whereas the underlying cause of death is the starting point of the chain of events leading to death. Robert Anderson, Chief of Mortality Statistics at the CDC illustrated this distinction with a practical example: “We might see a chain of events such as acute respiratory distress due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. So acute respiratory distress would be the immediate cause of death and then the COPD – the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – would be the underlying cause of death.” Therefore, it is possible to have a death certificate listing both COVID-19 and cardiac arrest as cause of death. In that case, cardiac arrest, which is a directly fatal condition, is the immediate cause of death, whereas COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death. In order to assess the death toll of a disease, the underlying cause of death is the primary factor to consider because without it there would be no death. As Anderson explained: “Suppose a person is shot by another person but survives with serious complications from the bullet wound. If those complications result in death, even if it occurs years later, then the underlying cause would be homicide. And actually these sorts of cases would be investigated as a homicide as well.” But by following OANN’s reasoning, if this person were to die from health complications resulting from their wound, it shouldn’t be investigated as a homicide and the murderer would walk free. Jeff Lancashire, the acting associate director for communications at the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), explained in a fact-check by PolitiFact that, “In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death”. In other words, COVID-19 was the initial cause that triggered the chain of medical events leading to the patient’s demise in the very large majority of cases. Therefore, those people died from COVID-19 and not just with COVID-19. Importantly, the CDC didn’t say that all the listed contributing health conditions were pre-existing, contrary to what OANN claimed. While some conditions are pre-existing, such as diabetes, others may be a consequence of COVID-19, although not directly involved in the sequence of clinical events leading to death. As Justin Lessler, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, explained in an article published by the university’s Office of Communications, some conditions are actually downstream of COVID-19, such as respiratory failure. In this example, the patient’s death would still be solely due to COVID-19, even though respiratory failure is listed on the death certificate as a contributing health condition. In other words, the claim ignores the fact that some of the listed contributing conditions like respiratory failure are a consequence of COVID-19 and not a separate cause. Other listed conditions are aggravating factors that decrease the overall health of the patient and weaken their ability to survive COVID-19, such as chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease or hypertensive diseases. These are called comorbidities. The death certificate explicitly defines comorbidities in Part II as the “other significant conditions contributing to death but not resulting in the underlying cause of death”. Hence, the major difference between a cause of death and a comorbidity is that comorbidities are not part of the series of events leading to the patient’s death described in Part I of the death certificate. A person dies from an underlying cause of death, but dies with comorbidities. In many cases, if the disease or injury had been avoided, those patients with comorbidities, including pre-existing conditions like diabetes, wouldn’t have died at that time. Furthermore, the claim incorrectly assumed that if a contributing condition was listed on the death certificate, then the patient must have always died from the contributing condition and never from COVID-19. For instance, there were 106,488 COVID-19 deaths where the patient also suffered from hypertensive diseases, as of 4 April 2021 (in the OANN news segment, the number was 44,000). There is no reason to assume that a patient suffering from hypertensive disease and COVID-19 would always die from the former and never from the latter. Likewise, not all deceased patients who were both obese and suffering from COVID-19 died from obesity and not from COVID-19. Finally, the claim made by OANN doesn’t account for the magnitude of excess deaths recorded in the U.S. during the pandemic. The CDC compared the mortality from February 2020 to March 2021 with the mortality from the previous years and found an excess of more than 600,000 deaths. There is plausible explanation for why people with diabetes, hypertension or Alzheimer’s disease would suddenly die at a higher rate during 2020 compared to previous years. It is more likely that the emergence of a new disease, COVID-19, caused most of this additional mortality. In summary, COVID-19 caused the death of more than 500,000 people in the U.S. as of April 2021. In many cases, the death certificates listed contributing conditions. Some may have been pre-existing conditions that weakened the patient, such as diabetes, while others may have been caused by COVID-19 itself, such as respiratory failure. In the vast large majority of cases, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death that triggered the chain of events leading to the patient’s demise. NOTES # The broadcast date of the OANN segment is unclear but appears to be from 2020 as it mentions 220,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. whereas the death toll reached more than 560,000 as of April 2021. Data available from the CDC are thus logically higher than those mentioned in the segment.\n",

Plymouth Rock cannot be used as an accurate gauge of area sea-level rise since 1620 because it was only placed in its current position in 1920, according to historical records. Further, the rock does become completely submerged under seawater during some very high tides.And the broader point about the sea not rising is also wrong.

Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksWhile it is often thought to be the landing place of the Pilgrims in 1620, the rock is not mentioned in the Pilgrim's written accounts of the landing, according to Donna Curtin, the executive director of Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts.Regardless, the rock has not been \"in the exact same spot\" since that time, she told USA TODAY. It has been broken and moved.The top part of the rock was broken off in 1774 and put on display in the town square and then outside Pilgrim Hall Museum. That piece wasn't reunited with the base of the rock until 1880. Both pieces were moved to their current location when the Plymouth waterfront was renovated in 1920, Curtin said.The rock sits on a concrete foundation and was partially covered by sand when it was repositioned in 1920, Carolyn Assa, a spokesperson for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, told USA TODAY in an email.A photograph provided to USA TODAY by Pilgrim Hall Museum curator, Connor Gaudet, shows the large white pillared monument that currently houses Plymouth Rock, without the rock inside of it.\"So you can't draw ... conclusions based on the assumption that the rock is where it's been for 400 years,\" Curtin said. \"It has been excavated.

            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share In defending his threatened new tariffs on steel and aluminum, President Trump has made a number of statements about trade deals and deficits. Here’s a guide to the rhetoric. “We lost, over the last number of years, $800 billion a year. Not a half a million dollars, not 12 cents. We lost $800 billion a year on trade. Not going to happen. We got to get it back.” — Trump, remarks to reporters, March 5 We are going to keep explaining this until we are blue in the face but countries do not “lose” money on trade deficits. For some reason, the president must have missed this lesson in economics class when he attended Wharton. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Canadian or Chinese goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce American purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would “gain” money that had been lost. Meanwhile, trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as the relative strength of currencies, economic growth rates, and savings and investment rates. Advertisement The president has said he wants to rescue jobs in the steel and aluminum industries. But many economists say more jobs could be lost in industries that rely on those materials for their products. Airplanes and airplane parts are one of the big export industries in the United States, helping to reduce the trade deficit, but the industry also uses a lot of aluminum. So higher costs for raw materials may increase the cost of jets and reduce sales overseas. The Trade Partnership, a consulting firm, released a report that concluded that five jobs would be lost for each one gained. In all, the report said, about 33,000 jobs would be gained, while 179,000 would be lost, for a net loss of about 146,000 jobs. (Caveat: Such estimates should be viewed with caution. We are only offering this as an illustrative example of the potential economic impacts. Still, when President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2003, his action may have saved as many as 10,000 jobs but cost up to 200,000 jobs.) The U.S. trade deficit in 2017 was $566 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Trump gets his $800 billion number by looking only at the deficit for trade in goods ($810 billion) even though U.S. trade in services runs a substantial surplus of $244 billion. Advertisement Interestingly, the recent annual report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which the president signed, offers a relatively benign view of trade deficits. “The United States has a goods deficit and a services surplus with the world,” the report noted. “The services surplus is consistent with the structure of the private sector, which has evolved during the last few decades toward more services output as a share of GDP.” The president’s consistent use of the word “lose” to describe trade deficits is worthy of Four Pinocchios. “We’ve had a very bad deal with Mexico, a very bad deal with Canada. It’s called NAFTA. Our factories have left our country. Our jobs have left our country. For many years NAFTA has been a disaster.” — Trump, remarks to reporters, March 5 First of all, the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. Once again, Trump is ignoring trade in services to make a pejorative claim about the biggest export market for the United States — and the second-biggest trading partner. Second, long before he was a politician, Trump was dismissive of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But he consistently exaggerates the effects. Here’s how the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2017 summarized the impact of NAFTA: Advertisement “The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP [gross domestic product]. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment.” Now, a quarter-century after NAFTA went into effect, the United States, Canada and Mexico constitute an economically integrated market, especially for the auto industry. Auto parts and vehicles produced in each country freely flow over the borders, without significant tariffs or other restrictions, as thousands of parts suppliers serve the automakers that build the vehicles. This is known as the “motor vehicle supply chain.” The manufacturing sector has declined as a source of jobs in the United States, but again Trump would be fighting against economic shifts long in the making. American manufacturing has become incredibly productive, so fewer workers are needed to make the same number of goods. The industries are not dead. Trump is focused on aluminum smelting jobs, but that’s only 3 percent of total aluminum industry jobs in the United States, according to the Aluminum Association. The rest of the jobs are in aluminum production and processing, which has been relatively consistent since 1980. The North American aluminum market is integrated, with much of the smelting taking place in Canada, one of the United States’ closest allies, where electricity costs are lower because of hydropower. (Aluminum smelting is an energy-intensive industry.) Meanwhile, U.S. steel exports as a share of the domestic market are only 27.5 percent, about the level in 1997. Monthly crude steel production has been consistent since the Great Recession, according to data compiled by trade lawyer Scott Lincicome. Fewer workers are required because the factories are run more efficiently. Advertisement The president is referring to a favorite example of his — Harley-Davidson motorcycles. India recently announced it would reduce the duties from 100 percent to 50 percent, but Harley already got around that higher duty by assembling in India most of the 4,500 motorcycles sold in the country. (Trump in the past has also accused India of selling “thousands and thousands” of motorcycles in the United States, but it’s only about 1,000.) Harley, for its part, says it is indifferent to the matter and has no objection to India’s import duties. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) also says the Wisconsin-based company opposes higher tariffs for steel and aluminum because of the potential negative impact on its sales.

They just got a £2,000 pay rise which now pays them £86,000 per year.\" Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in MPs can claim for utility bills MPs can claim their utility bills , including gas, electricity, other fuel and water bills, on expenses at a single property, either in London or their constituency. This is only available to those who aren't MPs in London , or don't occupy 'grace and favour' accommodation in London, for example 1 Carlton Gardens, which is the official residence available to the foreign secretary. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) confirmed to Full Fact that there is no upper limit on how much MPs can claim back on heating and fuel costs. There are upper limits on some other things they can claim on expenses like rent, hotel costs, and staff salaries. This claim appears to have stemmed from an article in the Daily Mail from January, which looked at how much MPs had claimed for utilities in 2020/21, and found Danny Kruger MP for Devizes had claimed £3,598.24 on utilities that year . A spokesperson for the MP told the paper he had challenged his provider on costs but couldn't get the bill reduced, and had since moved. MPs can claim back for petrol costs MPs can only claim costs for certain types of travel , like journeys within their constituency, certain UK travel and journeys within Europe. They can claim for costs between London and their constituency, but not commuting between their constituency office and residence, or from Westminster to their London residence. If they do these journeys by private car, they can claim 45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles and 25p/mile thereafter. For motorbikes it's 24p per mile and bicycles it's 20p per mile. MPs did just get a pay rise The post is correct to say that MPs got a £2,000 pay rise, but wrong on how much they now get paid. IPSA announced in March 2022 that MPs would be paid £84,144 (not £86,000 as the post claims) from April 2022, up from £81,932. They did not get a pay rise in 2021 .

            "[Evidences]:MSNBC anchor Brian Williams aired a tweet during his TV show that said former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who self-funded his since-suspended presidential campaign, spent so much money on ads that he could have instead delivered every American a fortune. \"Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads,\" the tweet said. \"The U.S. population is 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST.\" Williams read from the tweet after it was introduced by Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, who said that \"somebody tweeted recently that actually, with the money (Bloomberg) spent, he could’ve given every American a million dollars.\" how did this end up on tv? pic.twitter.com/xUYIOChhKv \"It’s an incredible way of putting it,\" Williams said after displaying the tweet on screen. If that sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is. A quick use of a calculator shows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person. That’s enough to buy a pack of gum or a Kit Kat bar at CVS, but it’s not breaking the bank. Williams quickly corrected the error on air, and the Twitter account for his TV show issued a correction and apology in a tweet posted hours after the show finished. \"Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math,\" Williams said after a commercial break. \"I’m speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American a dollar.\" \"The tweet is wrong,\" he said. Tonight on the air we quoted a tweet that relied on bad math. We corrected the error after the next commercial break and have removed it from later editions of tonight’s program. We apologize for the error. Gay also tweeted about the incident, saying she was \"buying a calculator, brb.\" As for the author of the original tweet, she switched her Twitter account settings to private but wrote in her bio, \"I know, I’m bad at math.\" Bloomberg did spend in the ballpark of $500 million on ads and other campaign-related finances, according to reports. And the census estimates that the U.S. population is a little more than 327 million people. But even at roughly $500 million, the billionaire didn’t spend nearly the amount of money he would've needed to give every American $1 million. That’s bad math.

            "[Evidences]:The first batch of five Rafale fighter jets touched down on Ambala airbase on July 29. These jets had taken off from Merignac airbase near Bordeaux in France on July 27 and flew 7,000 km with a single halt in UAE. Amid this, a video of a jet refuelling mid-air is circulating on social media with the claim that this is one of the Rafale jets en-route India. Several Facebook and Twitter users have posted the video with a caption saying, “Few shots from 30,000 feet! Mid air refuelling of #RafaleJets on their way to #India#rafale”. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral video is two years old and not of a Rafale jet. This is the footage of a Brazilian Air Force F-5 fighter jet refuelling a Brazilian Navy A-4 fighter jet mid-air. The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. With the help of InVID and reverse image search, we found that the same clip was tweeted by the Brazilian Air Force on September 28, 2018. The tweet in Portuguese translates to, “Interoperability! F-5 fighter of the Brazilian Air Force carries out refueling in flight on A-4 fighter of the Brazilian Navy!” It is true that en-route India, the Rafale jets were refuelled mid-air from a French tanker. This was tweeted by the Indian Air Force on July 29, 2020, with pictures of the same. Hence, it is confirmed that the two-year-old viral video of Brazilian jets refuelling mid-air has nothing to do with the in-flight refuelling of the Rafale jets on their way to India. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Video shows a Rafale jet refuelling mid-air at 30,000 feet while heading for India from France.

            "[Evidences]:An image being shared online shows an Israeli commemorative medal from 1967 featuring a plane, tank and the Torah, not an old Israeli shekel coin that depicts the 9/11 attacks, as some are claiming online. Examples can be seen (here) and (here) with the text: “1968 Israeli ‘shekel. 33 years before 9/11/2001.” Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks, when al Qaeda hijackers flew planes into the New York's World Trade Center towers and into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, while a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania (here). A reverse Google Image search reveals that the same object is visible on the website of the Cincinnati Judaica Fund and the Center for Holocaust & Humanity Education (here). It is described as the “French Israeli Six Day War commemorative medal” and is dated 1967. The images are described as “a legend in Hebrew along the edge “With G-d’s Will Was Saved the Peace of the World” with images of a plane, a tank and the Torah.” Indeed, what users on social media are calling two towers actually shows a Torah scroll. The Six Day War refers to when Israel swept to victory in six days in a war in 1967 with Egypt, Syria and Jordan, capturing the Sinai peninsula, Golan Heights, Gaza Strip and West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem (here). Shekels were issued on Feb. 24, 1980 and looked different to the medal seen in the posts (here).

            "claim [Claim]: \"All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus.”\n",
            "[Evidences]:North Carolina’s lieutenant governor is among the biggest critics of Gov. Roy Cooper’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican who’s running against Cooper, says kids should be allowed to go to school. Currently, students in kindergarten through 12th grade are only allowed to attend in-person classes in some counties — and only at a reduced capacity. In an interview posted Sept. 2, Forest said Cooper’s restrictions on in-person learning aren’t necessary. \"There’s no evidence anywhere in the world that our kids should not be in schools. There’s no evidence of that anywhere. All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus,\" he said. Is it true that children are \"17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?\" Forest has repeated similar claims at other events. We asked Forest’s campaign where he was getting his information. Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn pointed to a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal. Citing analysis from The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a think tank, the Journal wrote: \"Fatality rate comparisons between Covid-19 and the flu are inapt because they affect populations differently. Children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia, assuming 150,000 coronavirus deaths this year.\" Even if the Wall Street Journal’s description of the study is accurate, Forest isn’t representing it correctly. First, Forest ignores the paper’s disclaimer that comparisons between COVID-19 and the flu are \"inapt because they affect populations differently.\" Then, he misrepresented the math. The WSJ reported a mathematical range: \"between 6.8 and 17 times.\" Forest cherry-picked the top of that range and has stated it as if it is an accepted fact. Then, Forest misquoted the study. The Journal mentioned deaths, and Forest has repeatedly said \"ill effects.\" By doing this, Forest downplays the risk to children. The flu appears to be more of a serious threat to children than the novel coronavirus, as PolitiFact reported in August and September. But the CDC hasn’t said how much higher the risk is for the flu. And the CDC’s website distinguishes between healthy children and those with pre-existing conditions. For healthy children, the risk of complications \"is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,\" the CDC said. Meanwhile, kids with underlying medical conditions \"are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.\" The term \"ill effects\" is squishy and vague. Let’s look at how many children have been hospitalized by the two illnesses. (PolitiFact Wisconsin reported these figures in its Sept. 8 fact-check of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.) During the 2018-19 flu season, the hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children. For COVID-19 patients in that age group, the CDC says the hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children. (For those interested in the math: 39 is 6.5 times higher than 6.) While children do appear to be more affected by the flu than by COVID-19, we struggled to find stats that match Forest’s quote. We asked experts: Is there a consensus in the medical community that children are \"17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?\" \"I’m not familiar with such a statistic,\" said Bill Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Neither is Alan Schroeder, critical care physician at Stanford Children’s Health. Schroeder said he hesitates to put a number on the likelihood of children suffering from the flu more than COVID-19. \"The notion that kids aren’t getting really sick is by and large true. But the disparities between influenza and COVID-19 have narrowed considerably,\" he said. Schroeder noted that, generally speaking, between 100 and 200 children die each year from the flu in the U.S. (And those deaths occurred at times when the nation isn’t limiting travel or practicing social distancing.) Meanwhile, with the novel coronavirus in the U.S. for less than a year, the number of pediatric deaths is still rising. As of Sept. 10, the CDC estimated that 62 children, from infants up to age 14, have died from COVID-19. In the CDC’s 15-24 age bracket, coronavirus has killed another 315 people. Researchers think school cancellations this spring prevented up to even more deaths. The American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that COVID-19 had killed 90 people under age 20 by mid August. \"They’re really oversimplifying the issues at hand,\" Schroeder said of Forest’s quote. In the context of school reopenings, Schroeder said there’s a lot more to consider — children who have underlying conditions, child-to-adult transmissions — than a healthy child’s likelihood of dying when compared with the flu. \"And for that reason I don’t find it to be a useful comparison,\" he said. Forest said, \"All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus.\" He misrepresented a line in the Wall Street Journal, which said \"children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia.\" He cherry-picks the highest number and incorrectly uses \"ill effects\" rather than deaths. Are kids \"17 times\" more likely to suffer from the flu than COVID-19? It’s possible, but not conclusive at this point. Is death an \"ill effect\" of coronavirus? Of course. But Forest's phrasing doesn’t accurately represent the Wall Street Journal’s op-ed. Forest’s claim contains an element of truth. But it isn’t supported by \"all\" evidence, as he claims, and it downplays the risks of COVID-19 by focusing only on death. We rate it Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:2021 was the year COVID-19 vaccines became widely available to Americans after a grim 2020. While our resistance to the virus has improved with the vaccine, the pandemic persists. On Dec. 2, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, said in an email, \"According to the latest data from John (sic) Hopkins University, the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded so far in 2021 has surpassed the total for 2020.\" He linked this increased level of deaths to President Joe Biden and credited the vaccine development to former President Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed, a federal agency partnership to accelerate the development and distribution of the vaccine. We also found a Dec. 21 tweet by Williams that said, \"Americans are WORSE off under this Administration than ever before,\" citing \"More COVID deaths under President Biden than President Trump.\" At the request of a reader, we're fact-checking this claim: Is it true that, despite vaccine availability, more people died from COVID-19 in 2021 than in 2020? We reached out to Williams' office (five emails starting Dec. 6 and three phone calls) to confirm the email and ask about the source but received no answer. However, the original Dec. 2 newsletter email pointed to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center's global map that tracks active cases, vaccines administered, and deaths worldwide. The dashboard has tracked how the world is faring against COVID-19 since the pandemic's early days. National outlets including USA Today, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Forbes all reported in late November that the number of deaths in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. They used Johns Hopkins data as an up-to-date marker of 2021 deaths and compared that to the CDC's official count of 2020 death certificates. The outlets used the dashboard data instead of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on COVID-19 deaths since CDC data is less frequently updated. Data must be received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics. CDC data indicates there were 385,443 U.S. deaths attributing COVID-19 as an underlying or contributing cause on death certificates in 2020. By contrast, there were 446,197 U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates in 2021, as of Jan. 12. A CDC spokesperson wrote in a Jan. 5 email the CDC won't have the final 2021 data for nearly a year, but the death toll will climb as more data comes in for 2021. The spokesperson said it is safe to say the 2021 death toll will remain higher than in 2020. The CDC numbers show there were over 60,000 more deaths in 2021 compared to 2020. So, indeed, the number of COVID-19 deaths in 2021 as reported by the CDC exceeds the number of deaths reported in 2020. For Texas, the CDC counted 47,669 deaths involving COVID-19 in 2021 as of Jan. 12 and 33,542 deaths involving COVID-19 in 2020. Williams has voted against a mask mandate in the U.S. House and criticized Biden's vaccine mandate for employers, including in the same tweet he complained that Biden had presided over a higher COVID-19 death toll. The Biden administration has been advocating for vaccination as the linchpin in a strategy to combat the virus. Scientists call vaccination the single biggest protection against falling ill and dying from COVID-19. A September CDC report found that after the Delta variant became the most common variant, people who were not fully vaccinated had a 10-times-higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people. A study supported by the National Institutes of Health published in August estimated the vaccines prevented up to 140,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. during the first five months they were available. Spencer Fox, associate director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, said the first thing to consider when it comes to looking at 2020 and 2021 pandemic statistics is that 2020 is a ten-month period while 2021 is a full pandemic year. Much of the COVID-19 deaths happened March 2020 and onward; only 26 deaths involving COVID-19 were recorded for January and February 2020. Additionally, the U.S. experienced a surge in cases starting winter 2020 near the end of that year, Fox said. Many people died from those 2020 infections in early 2021, and that was well before vaccines were widely available. So while many of the infections in that wave happened in 2020, they were part of the 2021 mortality statistics. There was also a delta variant surge in summer 2021, after vaccines had become widely available to the public. \"What we've seen basically since that surge is really just continued spread,\" Fox said, noting that the delta and omicron variants surprised a lot of people. The delta variant was more infectious and had increased transmissibility, according to the CDC. \"But I think even though vaccines were widely available, I think a lot of the mortality that happened over the summer – during that major delta surge – was happening on unvaccinated individuals,\" Fox said. Fox noted that even though many people were vaccinated, vaccination rates were low. \"There was plenty kind of fuel for the COVID virus to spread on,\" Fox said. Timothy Bray, University of Texas at Dallas professor and director of the Institute for Urban Policy Research, noted there was not clear guidance at the beginning of the pandemic on how to record a death that was COVID-19-related. The institute runs the North Texas COVID Data Viewer and works with local governments on COVID-19 reporting. \"It didn't even have a cause of death code. And so, in the early days, we were asking local health departments to tell us how many people have you had that have died from COVID,\" Bray said. \"Eventually, that process became a little bit more concretized and was hung upon the death certificate process.\" Detecting and determining COVID-19 deaths has been an evolving process, Bray said, adding that numbers have become more accurate as officials got better at detecting the virus and knowing its complications. So while there have been more COVID-19 deaths counted in 2021, it's also important to note that individual medical professionals and local hospitals have gotten better at tracking deaths. And all that data on the local level rolls up to become the national-level data. \"Over time, the medical community's understanding of the disease, and the complications of the disease, has changed,\" Bray said. Williams' office wrote in a Dec. 2 email newsletter, \"According to the latest data from John (sic) Hopkins University, the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded so far in 2021 has surpassed the total for 2020.\" CDC data shows there were over 60,000 more deaths in 2021 compared to 2020. Johns Hopkins data, used by Williams and many national news outlets, also reported more deaths in 2021. We rate this claim True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:We've been asked to check an image that presents the EU referendum result split by constituency and region, and how MPs supposedly voted in the referendum. It's had over 35,000 shares on Facebook. Some of the numbers are not quite right, but all the trends are broadly correct. Below we've looked at each claim in turn. \"EU Referendum Results 2016 By Votes 17.4 million Leave | 16.1 million Remain\" This is correct . \"By constituency 406 Leave | 242 Remain\" This is broadly in line with the best estimates available, based on the seats parties won at the 2015 general election, although the numbers are not quite perfect (there are 650 constituencies in the UK, but the numbers in this image only add up to 648). Estimating referendum results by parliamentary constituency isn't easy , because the results weren't counted by constituency seat. Some councils released a breakdown of votes by constituency as well (although they didn't have to ), and the BBC accessed some data via Freedom of Information requests. The best overall figures we have on this are estimates from Professor Chris Hanretty , a political scientist at Royal Holloway University, who combined official results and the BBC data with statistical methods in order to estimate the proportion of Leave and Remain voters in every seat in England, Scotland and Wales (Northern Ireland published results by constituency). We've written more about these calculations here . Professor Hanretty estimated that 64% of seats in Great Britain probably voted to leave, or around 403 constituencies. Including the known results for Northern Ireland, that amounts to 410 constituencies voting leave (63%) and 240 voting remain. \"By constituency By Party Lab: 148 Leave | 84 Remain Con: 247 Leave | 80 Remain\" Once again, the numbers in this claim are not quite perfect but the trend is broadly correct. Using Professor Hanretty's estimates, and looking at the results from the 2015 general election, 249 Conservative-voting constituencies probably voted to leave, while 81 probably voted to remain (not including the speaker's constituency Buckingham, which probably voted to remain, based on these estimates). 148 Labour-voting seats probably voted to leave, while 84 probably voted to remain, which is exactly what the image says. Professor Hanretty acknowledges that we can't be certain about these numbers though, as there is some margin for error in the calculation. But if you take out the constituencies where there's most uncertainty about the result, the general pattern is still the same. Of course, there has since been another general election, so these figures don't reflect the situation today. However, even based on the 2017 general election results, the pattern is broadly the same . \"By Region 9 Leave | 3 Remain\" The image is correct in saying that nine regions overall voted to leave and three voted to remain (Scotland, Northern Ireland and London). \"By MP 160 Leave | 486 Remain\" Again, these numbers don't add up to 650, with four MPs unaccounted for. It's based on MPs elected at the 2015 general election, rather than the current set of MPs we have now, who were elected in 2017. It also refers to those MPs stated positions before the referendum, rather than after the result. The figures quoted are similar to the results of a survey by the Press Association, which asked every MP how they would vote in the referendum just before it happened in 2016. 480 said they would vote to remain, 159 said they would vote to leave, and 11 MPs did not declare. Politics Home published a similar article just before the referendum, based on public statements by the MPs, which concluded that 485 intended to vote remain, 156 to leave, and 9 had not declared. Of course, we can't know for sure how each MP voted in the referendum, so surveying them or using public statements is the best we've got. Providing a more up to date figure is difficult.  The more recent 2017 general election means some MPs have changed, and others have changed their position since the referendum result. We also know that many MPs who voted remain have since supported measures to leave the EU. 498 MPs voted in February 2017 in favour of triggering Article 50, which formally began the UK's exit process from the EU. Additionally, 286 voted in favour of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in March 2019.

            "[Evidences]:The health care plan proposed by Clinton doesn't offer lots of details, but in one spot the figure is in black and white: first-year cost, $110-billion. The proposal goes on to show how that cost would be paid for with savings from other changes to the health care system. There's no way to verify the $110-billion figure, but those off-setting savings? They're pretty optimistic, which is why we rate this claim as half-true. Much of the savings would come from \"discontinuing\" the 2001 tax cuts to households with incomes over $250,000 per year, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. Clinton, like most Democrats, has proposed letting those high-income tax cuts expire, which the Congressional Budget Office says would generate $52-billion in tax revenues. Over half of the $110-billion would come from such things as saving $10-billion by phasing out excessive Medicare payments to HMOs and other managed care plans. While it is true that the $10-billion in overpayments to Medicare HMOs exists in the system, so far the Senate has not agreed to such cuts. Whether Congress under a Clinton presidency would agree to slash reimbursements to a powerful private insurance lobby is yet to be seen. The plan also estimates that $35-billion could be saved by \"modernizing the health system\" by encouraging health care providers to adopt cost-saving information technology programs and better management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Clinton's policy expert said the figure is a very conservative estimate and multiple studies suggest the actual figure will be much higher. The Clinton campaign cited a 2005 Rand Corp. study that put the potential savings at $77-billion per year. But that study is not without critics. Dr. David Himmelstein and Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, practicing physicians as well as professors at Harvard Medical School, criticized the Rand study, noting that it was funded by a technology company.At the time, the two physicians wrote inHealth Affairs, \"For decades, vendors have capitalized on this enthusiasm. But hospitals and clinics have ended up with little to show for their large outlays.\" Himmelstein said Tuesday that promises of big savings through information technology is \"pure vaporware.\" \"And though there's some evidence that disease management improves care, there's no evidence it saves money,\" he said. \"People getting in to see their doctors means more cost, not less.\" \n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"You know, the border’s down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share “As you know, the border was a tremendous problem and now close to 80 percent stoppage.” — President Trump, remarks at a Cabinet meeting, July 31, 2017 “You know, the border’s down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, there was like this was a great thing. Down 78 percent.” — Trump, speech in New York, July 28, 2017 Curbing illegal immigration is a major promise by President Trump, and he frequently touts successes in doing so. While Southwest border crossings have, indeed, declined as a result of Trump’s rhetoric, it’s not nearly as dramatic as 78 or 80 percent. Moreover, Trump now says illegal immigration went up under previous administrations — which is false. Let’s dig in. The Facts Border activity bucked seasonal trends in the fall and winter of 2016. Usually, there’s a seasonal lull through winter months, before apprehensions of undocumented immigrants start climbing back up. Apprehensions tend to peak from March to May, before coming down again in the late summer and through the fall. Advertisement Yet in fall 2016, apprehensions kept increasing. People rushed to enter the country, which was an indication that Trump’s rhetoric may have sent a message to people who had planned to cross the border from Mexico, to do so before the election. Experts say Trump’s anti-illegal-immigration rhetoric played a role. After November 2016, the number of apprehensions and people “deemed inadmissible” at the border declined rapidly. In April 2017, the monthly number of apprehensions and people deemed inadmissible reached the lowest point since at least 2000, Customs and Border Protection data show. Since April, however, apprehensions started climbing again. This increase is consistent with seasonal trends. (The light blue line represents fiscal 2017 in the CBP chart below.) It’s unclear exactly what data Trump is using to claim a decline of up to 80 percent in border crossings. The White House did not respond to our inquiry. Advertisement His figure is consistent with the change in apprehensions data from the highest point in fiscal 2017 (November 2016, at 47,210) to the lowest point (April 2017, at 11,126), which is a 76.4 percent decline. That is a cherry-picked figure that shows the biggest possible decline in a given fiscal year — including the months before he took office. When you compare the data from his first full month in office (February 2017) with the latest data (June 2017), the decline is between 8 and 14 percent. Another way to look at this data is using year-over-year trends. From June 2016 to June 2017, the number of people apprehended or deemed inadmissible declined 52.6 percent. As FactCheck.org noted, it’s still a significant decline, but not as high as 80 percent. Clearly, monthly figures are quite susceptible to cherry-picking. So let’s take a broader look at the data. This shows Southwest border apprehensions have steadily declined since their peak at more than 1.6 million people in fiscal 2000. There have been temporary spikes since 2000 — most recently, there was an uptick in apprehensions of Central American unaccompanied children and their families in 2016, after a significant drop in 2015. The fiscal 2016 annual apprehensions are back down to early-1970s levels. Advertisement So Trump is incorrect that “under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up,” and that “the border was a tremendous problem” before his administration. There are many reasons for this decline, including economic and work conditions on both sides of the border. In recent years, there has been a shift in border migration. The number of Mexicans caught trying to cross the border illegally is dropping, and the number of families and children fleeing rampant violence and crime in Central America is increasing. The Pinocchio Test When Trump debuted this talking point, we awarded just One Pinocchio for his use of CBP data. He was largely correct about the large declines, but his apples-to-oranges method led to numbers that were slightly off. But apprehensions are going up again. His figure now reflects the biggest possible decline even though it measures figures from before he became president, and does not use the most up-to-date data. While monthly and annual figures are susceptible to cherry-picking, the decline under his presidency is as low as 8 percent, and the decline in June 2017 compared with June 2016 is 52.6 percent. That places his claim at the Three-Pinocchio range. Advertisement Then this talking point spins out of control when Trump falsely says border activity actually went up, not down, before his administration. In reality, illegal border crossings are back down to early-1970s levels, and apprehensions have steadily declined since their peak in 2000, with temporary upticks here and there.

            "[Evidences]:A particularly low-effort hoax spreading online in March 2018 — part of a wave of attempted smear campaigns directed at survivors of a February 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida who are calling for stricter gun-control legislation — has led some people to accuse one of the Parkland, Florida mass shooting survivors of vandalism. The hoax was a miscaptioned photograph showing a woman with a bald head as she seemingly prepared to drive an umbrella into a vehicle alongside the caption: “Emma Gonzalez attacking a 2nd amendment supporter’s truck at a #MarchForOurLives rally (colorized).” An alleged “satire” site posted the picture alongside a different — but equally false— caption: Emma Gonzalez has surfaced in a photo breaking cars with an assault umbrella. We will update you when more information comes in. But the woman is the picture is not Emma González; the photograph actually shows singer Britney Spears during an infamous February 2007 incident that was widely covered at the time. Spears later apologized to the photographer who owned the truck, saying that she was “preparing [her] character” for a movie role. “I take all my roles very seriously and got a little carried away,” Spears wrote in July 2007. “Unfortunately I didn’t get the part.” Ten years later, Daniel Ramos, the paparazzo who owned the truck targeted by Spears, announced that he would auction the umbrella off and donate half of the proceeds to charity. (A spokesperson for RR Auction, through whom Ramos intended to sell the umbrella, told us that it was returned to him after it failed to raise an opening bid of $10,000.) The use of the photograph of Spears to insult González is part of a wave of smears directed toward herself and other survivors of the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018; she was also falsely accused of ripping up a copy of the United States Constitution and accused of being a “communist” for wearing a patch showing the Cuban flag; González is actually Cuban-American.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says withdrawing troops from Afghanistan could save the U.S. $50 billion.\n",
            "[Evidences]:After nearly 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan, the United States has pledged to withdraw its forces from the country. President Joe Biden announced a plan to have all U.S. troops out of the country by Sept. 11, 2021, but an accelerated pace of withdrawal could have troops completely out of the country by mid-July, according to a May 25, 2021 report from the New York Times. As America’s longest war draws to a close, arguments have sprung up over what to do with the money the country is currently spending on the conflict -- and how much will actually be saved by pulling troops out of the unstable region. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, claimed that withdrawing troops from Afghanistan could save the country $50 billion a year in a May 21, 2021 tweet -- money he argues could be cut from the Pentagon budget and put towards something else, such as ending homelessness. For the purpose of this fact check, we’re going to focus on the first part of his claim. Can bringing home the troops in Afghanistan really save the country $50 billion? In short, not as a practical matter. When we reached out to Pocan’s office seeking backup, communications director Usamah Andrabi said that the $50 billion had been widely reported, and shared a link to a report by The Balance, a nonpartisan financial advice and news site, based in New York City. The war started off in 2001, with 9,700 people on the ground in Afghanistan, at a cost of $23 billion, according to The Balance. That number has grown since then, hitting $107 billion in spending in 2011, with more than 94,000 people on the ground. Since then, yearly spending has dropped as the number of troops stationed in the country has declined. In 2018, that number dropped to $52 billion in spending, and remained the same for 2019, according to an estimate by The Balance. Spending for 2020 was not yet available. But even though the U.S. is currently spending about $50 billion a year on the war, that doesn’t mean that pulling troops out will amount to that same figure in savings. Jonathan Bydlak, director of the Governance Program for the R Street Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, said estimating cost savings from shifts in ground troops and other foreign policy decisions isn’t straightforward. There are three things that would need to be considered to reach an estimation of savings, he said: The direct costs of engagement. Changes in the base Department of Defense budget because of reduced engagement. Ongoing/long-term costs, primarily veterans’ medical/disability benefits and interest. Bydlak estimated the U.S. could see about $4 billion to $6 billion in direct savings, about $1 billion to $2 billion in base budget savings and about $28 billion to $42 billion in long-term costs. That puts total savings somewhere between $33 billion and $50 billion a year. So, Pocan’s claim is on the very high end of that range. But that savings could shrink if Biden opts to only withdraw a portion of the troops currently on the ground, leaving a small residual force. In that case, savings would only be about $7 billion to $10 billion. There are also other costs that could crop up, too, Bydlak said: If the U.S. decides to provide more aid to Afghanistan, to help encourage stability; if more money is spent by the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of withdrawal; or if the domestic cost of housing troops is greater than the cost of stationing them in Afghanistan, due to a higher cost of living. Others worry that any savings for the U.S. could be eaten up -- at least in the short term -- by the cost of pulling troops and supplies out of Afghanistan. Mackenzie Eaglen, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning public policy think tank, said in an April 26, 2021 report that spending in Afghanistan will still remain high without boots on the ground due to ongoing investments in counterterrorism and salaries and other expenses for the 3,000 members of the Afghan National Security Forces. Among other potential costs Eaglen included in her report: Breaking contracts with private entities for property, buildings and equipment and bringing home the equipment the U.S. brought with its troops. \"It will require more forces than are in the country now,\" the article said. Bringing troops home isn’t an end to the mission that started in 2001 in Afghanistan, it’s a mission change, Eaglen wrote. \"If Congress is expecting a windfall of savings to result from the Afghanistan withdrawal, it is likely to be disappointed,\" Eaglen wrote. \"Threats will still need to be managed -- just from slightly farther away. In the meantime, it will discover that leaving is hard, dangerous, and expensive.\" Pocan claimed in a tweet that the country could save $50 billion a year by pulling troops out of Afghanistan. The U.S. could save up to $50 billion, or as little as $7 billion on withdrawing troops, according to one expert. But that just covers one side of the ledger. There are many other potential costs that must be accounted for, such as the possibility of a small residual force left on the ground in Afghanistan, mental and physical health care for veterans returning home, or even the higher cost of housing active troops as they return to the states. One expert suggests that leaving Afghanistan, at least in the short term, will likely cost the U.S. more than it saves, because of the need to continue funding counterterrorism infrastructure, end contracts with local entities and pay for removing equipment from the landlocked country. Our definition of Mostly False is a statement \"contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That fits here. \n",

            "[Evidences]:A group fighting against the Affordable Care Act repeal says that House Republicans voted for a health care bill that would lead to skyrocketing costs for older consumers. Save My Care, a health care advocacy group, launched an ad attacking two dozen GOP House members who voted for the American Health Care Act including U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami. \"Congressman Curbelo just voted for a disastrous health care repeal bill opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP and the American Cancer Society. Curbelo voted to raise your costs and cut coverage for millions, to let insurance companies deny affordable coverage for cancer treatment and maternity care, and charge five times more for people over 50. Curbelo voted yes even though the bill makes coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions,\" the ad claims. The same ad also attacks U.S. Rep. Brian Mast who represents Florida’s Treasure Coast and members in many other states, including moderates who could face tough re-election campaigns in 2018. The ad is largely digital but in some districts it will appear on TV. Formed in 2016, Save My Care is affiliated withEric Kessler, a former White House appointee, helping to manage conservation issues during Bill Clinton’s administration. It operates out of the same office as the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) that launches projects related to global health and other areas. There were a lot of claims to check out from the ad, but we wanted to know whether the bill allows insurance companies to \"charge five times more for people over 50.\" One provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market. Some viewers might assume the five-fold increase starts from zero. What the ad doesn’t tell you is that insurers can already charge older people more than younger adults — three times as much. Age ain’t nothing but a number (but it couldmake insurance more expensive) For this fact-check, we’re looking at what the proposed House health bill does about older adults between ages 50-64 on the individual health insurance market. So this doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 \"rate banding.\" The House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio. Before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five timesthe premiums charged to younger adults, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults’ health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status. If the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the Rand Corporation, which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. (The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.) The increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums. Young people, however, would get a break on premiums. Older Americans could get hit with other costs, too The change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults. The legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. For adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit. For adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000. The legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000). Kaiser created an interactive map to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors. \"Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,\" Kaiser concluded about the House bill. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit. For an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that person’s premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4) Older Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine essential health benefits for coverage in the individual market. \"I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA,\" Blumberg said. Curbelo’s spokeswoman told us Curbelo has called for improving the bill that he voted for. \"The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement,\" Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact. Our ruling The Save My Care ad says that Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies \"charge five times more for people over 50.\" The ad refers to a provision that will allow insurance companies to charge adults five times more for insurance than younger people buying on the individual market. But the ad could leave a misleading impression that it’s five times more than the current situation -- and that’s not the case. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to charge this age group three times as much for insurance (which was considered a better deal than the situation before). Also, the increase in the ratio applies to Americans ages 50-64 -- not seniors who are on Medicare. We rate this claim Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A poll taken \"a few months ago\" found \"70 percent approval or higher\" for the Act 10 collective bargaining law.\n",
            "[Evidences]:During a radio interview on April 1, 2014, Gov. Scott Walker claimed that a poll taken \"a few months ago\" showed \"70 percent approval or higher\" for Act 10, the collective bargaining reform law that spurred massive protests in Madison and an attempt to remove him from office. Statewide polls typically get widespread news coverage. But we don’t recall any recent headlines about 70 percent support for Act 10, which sharply curbs collective bargaining for most public employees and makes the employees pay more for their pensions and health care. Walker's claim is important because he is counting on support for the law in his effort to win re-election in November 2014. So let's see what the governor is talking about. Act 10 Walker largely credits Act 10 for shoring up state and local government finances. The measure has been vilified for repealing most collective bargaining for public employee unions, both at the state and local government levels. But even Walker’s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, who thinks Act 10 went too far on that score, is among critics who say the law nevertheless took a necessary step in requiring most public employees to pay more for their benefits. Walker signed the bill two months after taking office, in March 2011. Because of reaction to it, he faced a recall election in June 2012. The timing is important in assessing Walker's claim. It has been more than three years since Act 10 became law and nearly two years since it was the focus of the recall. In other words, it hasn't been a hot topic for pollsters for some time. And public opinion can change. The claim Walker made his statement about support for Act 10 to Jay Weber, a conservative radio talk show host at WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. Weber began the interview by praising a number of Walker’s tax cuts, including a trim to property taxes. Then he alluded to Walker’s race with Burke. Weber cited results from a statewide Marquette Law School poll released on March 26, 2014, six days before the interview, and asked Walker about his approval rating. The poll had shown 47 percent of registered Wisconsin voters approved of how Walker handled his job. That was down from 51 percent in the previous Marquette survey, done two months earlier. The new poll, Weber said, \"showed that there was strong approval for the tax cut -- who wouldn’t want their taxes cut? -- but it didn’t translate into a bump in your approval ratings. So, what does that tell you -- you need to sell this before fall?\" \"Yeah, I think so. I think a combination,\" Walker said before citing another poll result, albeit with a number of qualifiers. \"If you look at that, the previous poll that was taken a few months ago also showed, I think, there was something like -- if I remember right -- something like 70 percent approval or higher for our reforms, the reforms that are commonly called Act 10, the budgetary reforms which allowed not just the state but local governments to balance their budgets as well.\" Cleaned up, here’s the claim we’re checking: A poll taken \"a few months ago\" -- so, roughly early 2014, or perhaps late 2013 -- found \"70 percent approval or higher\" for Act 10. The evidence Neither the March 2014 Marquette Law School poll cited by Weber, nor the January 2014 version Walker seemed to allude to, included any questions about Act 10. So we wondered which survey Walker was relying on to back his claim. Walker press secretary Laurel Patrick told us the governor was referring to a question in the Marquette poll from late May 2012. That's nearly two years ago. That question asked: \"As you know, last year a number of changes were made concerning state employees, state spending and policies. For each, please tell me if this is something you favor or oppose -- requiring public employees to contribute to their own pensions and pay more for health insurance?\" The results were: Favor – 75%; Oppose – 22%; Don't Know – 3%. On other questions, however, support was not that high: 55% said they favored limiting collective-bargaining for most public employees and 50% said they preferred the change to collective bargaining rather than going back to the old law. (Another school that does regular statewide polling in Wisconsin is St. Norbert College near Green Bay. Like Marquette, it has not polled on Act 10 since May 2012. The results at that time: 59 percent favored allowing public employees to collectively bargain for wages and 60 percent favored bargaining for health and retirement benefits.) In any case, the Marquette results Walker cites are from nearly two years ago, not a few months ago. And no publicly released poll has asked Wisconsinites about Act 10 since then, according to Marquette Law School poll director Charles Franklin and St. Norbert College political science professor Wendy Scattergood, an associate with the St. Norbert College Survey Center Wisconsin. As for what the level of support for Act 10 there may have been a few months ago, Franklin told us the results could be the same, but: \"We simply don't know.\" Our rating Walker said a poll \"taken a few months ago\" found \"70 percent approval or higher\" for his Act 10 collective bargaining law. No known poll has asked Wisconsinites about Act 10 in the months leading up to Walker's statement on April 1, 2014, and his staff did not cite one. One poll question from May 2012 found 75 percent support for one part of the law, but what the level of support for Act 10’s various provisions might have been a few months ago is strictly speculation. We rate Walker's statement False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:More than a week after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, CNN’s State of the Union hosted a roundtable that included a discussion of crime and race in America. Among the panelists was Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker from Georgia. \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected,\" Gingrich said. \"There is no federal program to stop it. No one wants to have an honest conversation about it.\" It wasn’t the first time Gingrich had made this point. In an op-ed, Gingrich wrote, \"Although the president does not acknowledge the gangs' role as a major cause of the epidemic of violence, the FBI does. The FBI estimated in 2011 that there are roughly 1.4 million active gang members in the U.S., an astonishing 40 percent increase from 2009. These gangs, the FBI says, are responsible for ‘an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and much higher in others.’ \" We were able to locate the FBI study Gingrich referred to in the op-ed -- the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment. Gingrich accurately quoted the report, which said, \"Approximately 1.4 million active street, (outlaw motorcycle) and prison gang members, comprising more than 33,000 gangs, are criminally active\" in the United States, which \"represents a 40 percent increase from an estimated 1 million gang members in 2009.\" (The 1 million figure came from the 2009 edition of the same FBI study.) Because Gingrich’s 40 percent figure comes from federal statistics, we agree that it has some credibility. But we will raise two issues of concern. Uncertainty about the statistics Because gang activity is illegal, it’s difficult to get solid numbers. So the FBI estimated as best it could. To do this, the FBI used a combination of data from a survey of law enforcement agencies by the National Drug Intelligence Center, along with additional interviews with law enforcement officials. The survey the FBI used randomly sampled roughly 3,000 state and local law enforcement agencies to gauge how prevalent gangs are in their jurisdiction. This is a reasonable approach to tackling a challenging question, but it’s not gospel. Criminologists warned PolitiFact to be wary of several factors. • The survey is not just an estimate -- it’s an estimate of estimates. All surveys are subject to sampling error -- that is, the possibility that the people being surveyed aren’t actually random, thus biasing the results. But at least many surveys sample something that the respondent will find easy to quantify -- say, whether they approve of the job President Obama is doing, or how many cars they own. The survey the FBI used, however, has uncertainty not just about whether the sample was truly random, but also about whether the answers given are actually accurate. The report itself \"acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members\" because of how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area. • The smell test. A jump of 40 percent in just two years is an enormous increase, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. \"If there were really a 40 percent increase in two years, you would see a big impact on crime statistics generally, but we haven’t,\" he said. \"Crime rates are fairly level.\" • Who counts as a gang member? There’s no universal definition of who counts as a gang member. \"Actual gang members can deny membership, and wanna-bes can claim membership,\" said Eugene O’Donnell, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"In both cases it is difficult to discern for sure.\" • Institutional bias. Local law enforcement officials have an interest in overstating -- or at least not understating -- the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, since a bigger gang problem can help them secure more federal assistance, O’Donnell said. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem for the soundness of the data if an independent assessment was also factored in, but none is. The estimate is based solely upon the opinions of state and local law-enforcement officials. All in all, O’Donnell said, \"there are multiple grounds for being skeptical\" about the estimate. Making significant public policy decisions based on them would be manifestly unsound.\" Does Obama deserve blame? Gingrich said, \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected.\" If he had said \"between 2009 and 2011,\" we wouldn’t have addressed the issue of whether he was blaming the president. But Gingrich chose to use Obama’s presidency to mark time. The Gingrich camp firmly disagrees that the former House speaker was blaming Obama for an increase in gang activity. They point to previous op-eds -- including the one we mentioned earlier -- as evidence that Gingrich was simply saying that crime issues that inspire a lot of media attention -- such as mass shootings and the Martin case -- obscure a more far-reaching crime concern, gangs. \"Newt mentioned Obama to make that contrast – in other words, ‘Is a Trayvon Martin-type occurrence really what is most important to be focused on when it comes to the personal safety of African-Americans?’\" said Joe DeSantis, a spokesman for Gingrich. \"After all, the president had just held a press conference to talk about the Martin verdict. Newt did not say that Obama was to blame for the increase in gang violence.\" The Gingrich camp is correct that he has made that argument in previous op-eds, but we didn’t see him mentioning it in the CNN discussion. And because a CNN viewer most likely wouldn’t have read Gingrich’s past op-eds, we think it’s fair to rate him in part for bringing Obama into the discussion of gang growth. There are, in fact, some things that an administration can do to bolster law enforcement generally and gang activity specifically. Contrary to Gingrich’s claim that \"there is no federal program to stop\" gangs, the Justice Department does have an Organized Crime and Gang Section, which was established under Obama in late 2010 as a consolidation of several existing offices. However, while federal funding and technical assistance can help, Fox said that \"there’s relatively little that the president can do to discourage a 12-year-old from joining a gang.\" Most gang activity is handled by local law enforcement departments, and both demographics, including the number of young people in an area, and economic conditions are important drivers of gang membership. \"Gangs are always hiring, even when legitimate employers aren’t because the economy is in bad shape,\" Fox said. And in recessions, he added, \"younger, inner-city people are hit especially hard.\" Our ruling Gingrich said that \"gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected.\" Gingrich deserves credit for using statistics from a credible federal agency, but it’s important to note that methodological difficulties make it hard for anyone, even the FBI, to determine how many gang members there are in the United States. Criminologists express skepticism about whether gang membership could have jumped 40 percent in just two years, saying that broader crime statistics don’t show any sign of it. In addition, despite the Gingrich camp’s insistence that he did not mean to cast blame on Obama for the rise in gang membership, we think that a reasonable viewer of the discussion could have made such an inference. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/682949c8-0c99-4bd5-959a-cf2953e8cfce\n",

A post on Facebook falsely claims that different media outlets misused a boy’s image to report that he died from the coronavirus three times in three different countries. The post shares a collage of screenshots of various news reports that appear to include the same image. The text above reads: \"Child dies in 3 countries of corona virus.\" The photo depicts Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a 14-year-old Portuguese boy who died at the end of March after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The Portuguese newspaper Record wrote about his death. Other news outlets also reported on Godinho’s death and correctly identified him, including the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail, whose article appears in the center of the collage. The Daily Express, another U.K. outlet in the collage, wrote about a 12-year-old girl who died from COVID-19 in Belgium. That story includes Godinho’s photo, but not in connection with the girl. It includes his photo in a reference to another young person who died from the virus and correctly identifies him in the caption. Lastly, an article by the U.K.’s Daily Record that appears in the Facebook post didn’t use Godinho’s photo at all. That March 31 story covered the death of a 13-year-old boy, Ismail Mohaemd Abdulwahab, from the U.K. There is no photo of any child in the article. It’s unclear where the screenshot combining Godinho’s photo and Abdulwahab’s name originated. We couldn’t find its source. Godinho’s photo does turn up in image searches on the Abdulwahab story headline, but they link to accurate reports about Godinho’s death.

            "[Evidences]:What’s your friendly \"Florida Man\" up to this time? According to what looks like a CNN news headline, he’s MacGyvered some home electricity from a nuclear bomb. \"Florida man arrested for using a lost U.S. nuke to power his home for more than 27 years,\" the headline says. Below the headline is a booking photo of a man, and another photo showing what looks like a scuba diver next to the supposed nuke. An Instagram post sharing a screenshot of it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) This headline isn’t on CNN’s website and we found no credible evidence of such a story anywhere, from CNN or other news outlets. Some unsourced blog posts referred to the \"Florida Man\" as Cesar Sayoc. Sayoc was supporter of former President Donald Trump who was arrested in Florida and sentenced to prison in 2019 after pleading guilty to mailing 16 pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. But a reverse image search of the booking photo that appears in the Instagram post reveals this is not Sayoc — it’s a different person with a different name. The Guardian ran the photo with a 2020 story about \"violence in the name\" of Trump. The man was arrested in Albany, New York, in 2016 and charged with misdemeanor aggravated harassment for threatening to beat a Black woman and using racial slurs against her while she waited for a taxi, the Guardian reported. A reverse image search of the scuba diver photo led us to a 2014 story by German news broadcaster DW about bombs that were dropped on land and at sea during a 1943 British air raid of a German military site. The story describes the old munitions as explosive, but not as nuclear bombs. Plus, the air raids predated the world’s first nuclear explosion by about two years.But the suggestion in the fake CNN headline about a Florida man powering his home with a nuclear bomb might stem from a 2015 story on the satire site World News Daily Report.

            "[Evidences]:Bernie Sanders condemned Wall Street for creating and now profiting off Puerto Rico’s debt crisis during a campaign stop on the island. Puerto Rico is currently $72 billion in debt and, in the words of its governor, in \"a death spiral.\" Unlike other states and cities, it cannot legally declare bankruptcy. So Sanders called for the Federal Reserve to help the U.S. territory out, just as it bailed out the financial sector responsible for imperilling 3.5 million Puerto Ricans in the first place. \"I think all of us understand and your government understands that Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable,\" Sanders said May 16 at a town hall in San Juan. \"And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds.\" So is Wall Street to blame for the island’s economic woes? Sanders has a point that hedge funds and banks are certainly exacerbating the situation and, in some cases, attempting to block a solution. However, experts told us and the research showsthat Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt long before Wall Street got involved. Origins of the debt This $72 billion debt did not appear solely thanks to the maneuvers of Wall Street. Rather, it’s been building up for decades, resulting from a combination of U.S. policy, local mismanagement and economic decline. The local government has essentially maxed out a very special credit card given to it and other U.S. territories. When the island became a commonwealth in 1917, Congress also made bonds issued by the Puerto Rican government \"triple tax-exempt\" (meaning they can’t be taxed at the federal, state or local level) and thus very attractive to investors. For decades, this allowed the government to overspend, in part out of necessity and in part out of sheer irresponsibility. Puerto Rico has had to pick up a disportionate chunk of the tab for federal social programs. More than 60 percent of its residents receive Medicare or Medicaid, but federal funding is considerably lower than the states. (For example, $3 billion for Oklahoma’s Medicaid program and $3.6 billion for Mississippi’s compared to $373 million for the island, a fraction of its $2.9 billion in expenses.) Disparities in funding aside, the local government has also made some poor management and spending decisions. Inefficient public utilities have been running up the tab since the 1940s and now account for the largest portion of Puerto Rico’s debt ($20 billion). Meanwhile, the state-run power authority continues to dole out free electricity. Similarly, public employees enjoy \"lavish pension benefits\" like holiday bonuses and loans for international travel but the pensions remain severely underfunded ($1.9 billion in assets versus $45.5 billion in liabilities). Now add in changes in federal policy, economic depression and population decline and you’ve got a recipe for even less revenue and total debt unsustainability. For decades, U.S. businesses operating in Puerto Rico received significant tax breaks, an economic boon for the island. But that all ended in 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed legislation phasing out the incentives over 10 years. By 2006, Puerto Rico was already $43 billion in debt and fell into a recession that, compounded by the global financial crisis, continues to this day. Marc Joffe, the principal consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions, tracked Puerto Rico’s debt from 1910 to 2015. Here’s a chart we made using his data: Wall Street’s role The island was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, but Wall Street is certainly profiting off of the situation. According to Sanders in his San Juan address and his campaign, hedge funds now hold about 50 percent of Puerto Rico’s debt. This is the high end of estimates we found, which range from 20 percent to 50 percent. But this is a relatively recent development. Prior to 2014, most of Puerto Rico’s bonds were owned by traditional mutual funds and retail investors, according to Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked in the Obama administration's Treasury Department. Morningstar, the research investment firm, estimated that some 180 mutual funds had Puerto Rican bonds in their portfolios in 2013. In 2014, multiple credit ratings agencies downgraded Puerto Rico’s bonds to junk status. Because of the high risk associated with this low grade, most traditional investors were unable or unwilling to invest. Enter Wall Street. Hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers \"eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains\" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent (the high rate reflecting the high risk). As Puerto Rico’s debt had already topped $70 billion in 2013, $3.5 billion wouldn’t have made much of a difference. \"The combination of Puerto Rico’s decision (to sell more bonds) and the availability of Wall Street financing helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole,\" said Setser. In fact, if the hedge funds hadn’t purchased these bonds, which were after all issued to pay off old debt, \"the crisis would have come a little earlier since the level of debt was already unsustainable,\" said Joffe of Public Sector Credit Solutions. That being said, Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism as some hedge funds and banks have certainly chosen to take advantage of the situation, said Rafael Fantauzzi of the National Puerto Rican Coalition. Since 2014, hedge funds have been buying up bonds on the cheap in the secondary market (those previously owned by traditional investors). Sanders’ campaign provided PolitiFact an example of bonds bought for 29 cents on the dollar yielding an interest of 34 percent. Bloomberg has reported yields ranging from under 10 percent to as high as 80 percent. Sanders in his San Juan speech and his campaign also noted that banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS have received hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to manage the island’s bond sales. The exact figure, according to the Wall Street Journal, is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006. That’s the equivalent of a service charge of 2.3 percent, double the average rate for municipal bond sales but quadruple the rate for corporate bond sales. Exacerbating the situation The most damning evidence for \"the greed of vulture funds\" is Wall Street’s efforts to prevent Puerto Rico from digging itself out of the hole. As we’ve previously reported, Puerto Rico is legally unable to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. But there is currently legislation in motion to allow the island to restructure the debt. The Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times report of a letter representatives of BlueMountain, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rican bonds, sent to Republican staff members urging against allowing debt restructuring. The Center for Individual Freedom, a dark money group, has also spent $2 million on issue ads against debt relief efforts in Congress, supporting the hedge funds’ position. \"That’s very concerning that financial interests, specially these so-called ‘vulture funds,’ are disrupting the political process and preventing Puerto Rico having a smoother landing in this situation they got themselves into,\" said Joffe, adding that that’s what they did in Argentina as well. In lieu of debt restructuring, Wall Street recommends cutting spending. A report commissioned by 34 hedge funds advises Puerto Rico to raise taxes, lay off teachers, close schools, and cut wages and worker benefits, Medicaid, and welfare. (About 45.4 percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line and the commonwealth already closed 150 schools in the last five yearsand increased its sales tax.) So while the hedge funds and banks \"have played a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution,\" said Setser, they are \"playing a more important role in hindering a bipartisan solution.\" Our ruling Sanders said, \"Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable. And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds.\" Puerto Rico’s debt was already unsustainable by the time Wall Street hedge funds and banks began playing a role as a result of decades of local mismanagement, U.S. policy and economic misfortune. But Sanders has a point that the financial sector has taken advantage of and is excerbating the situation. What's more, they're effectively preventing crisis relief byactively working to stop Puerto Rico from restructuring its debt. We rate his claim Half True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:An incomplete quote from U.S. President Joe Biden during his first address to Congress on April 28, is making rounds on social media. But Biden’s statement “No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck” is missing context: footage of the moment shows that, while discussing medical and paid leave proposed in his new $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, he expressed people should not have to choose between working and taking care of themselves or their families. The incomplete quote has spread in form of memes (here,here,here), videos (here,here,here) and text posts (here,here). Comments include: “Good lord is he dumb” and “Oh the things he says... Please tell me this isn't real.” By cutting what comes after his sentence, posts on social media suggest he was talking about having to choose between working and getting paid, which is misleading. The footage (youtu.be/TZANXb_6x0k?t=2914) and transcript (here) of his address show he was arguing that, without paid or medical leave, people have to choose between working and taking care of themselves or their families, and that people should not have to do that. He said: “Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of medical leave, paid medical leave. We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — no one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves or their loved ones, or their parent or spouse or child.” According to the White House’s factsheethere, the American Families Plan would guarantee 12 weeks of “paid parental, family, and personal illness/safe leave” by year 10 of the program and also assure that workers receive three days of bereavement leave a year starting in the first year. The proposed plan, which would raise taxes on wealthy individuals to pay for initiatives shoring up lower-income families, also seeks to provide free meals to millions more low-income children ($45 billion), universal pre-kindergarden ($200) and free community college regardless of income ($109 billion), among other measures.

            "claim [Claim]: Opposition contested Centres statement about no infiltration case across India-China border in last 3 years by bringing up Galwan Valley violence\n",
            "[Evidences]:Minister of State for Home Affairs Nisith Pramanik told the Lok Sabha on December 7, 2021 that there had been no cases of infiltrations along the India-China border in the last three years, while troops from Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar have infiltrated the border on several occasions. Soon after this, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, contested Pramanik's response by highlighting the 2020 violent clash between the Indian and Chinese armies at Ladakh's Galwan Valley, which led to the loss of lives of 20 Indian military personnel . He tweeted, \"The Home Ministry has told Parliament that there has been no intrusion on Indo-China border in last 3 years. So Galwan didn't happen, our soldiers didn't die and the Chinese village in Arunachal is indeed built by BEIJING JANATA PARTY under PM Awas Yojna?\" Pramanik's response listed that in the past three years, there were 128 cases of infiltration along the India-Pakistan border, 1,787 along the India-Bangladesh border, 25 along the India-Nepal border, and 133 along the India-Myanmar border, but there were no cases of infiltration reported along the India-Bhutan and India-China border. The Home Ministry has told Parliament that there has been no intrusion on Indo-China border in last 3 years. So Galwan didn't happen, our soldiers didn't die and the Chinese village in Arunachal is indeed built by BEIJING JANATA PARTY under PM Awas Yojna? While Pramanik's response is concerned with \"infiltration\", Kharge has tweeted about \"intrusion\". Before verifying this information, FactChecker looked at what these terms mean. Defining Infiltration, Transgression & Intrusion Infiltration: Colonel Deepak Kumar , a research fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, defines infiltration as a \"technique of tactical movement by small forces over land, air, or water through an area or territory occupied by friendly forces or an enemy, or in the close vicinity of enemy positions. The movement is made at extended or irregular intervals. The aim of infiltration could be of temporarily occupying a feature of tactical importance, or locating a force to attack an enemy position from an unexpected direction or isolating an enemy locality for an attack by a larger follow-up force. It is inherent while infiltrating in enemy territory or close to it that contact with the enemy is avoided\". Transgression: \"When a military body of troops goes into the other side of the border assuming that it is their own territory due to the difference in the perception of the border itself,\" defined the officer, who was involved in counter insurgency operations in Kashmir as part of Operation Rakshak. Intrusion: Using an open-source definition, Col Kumar explains that intrusion is \"movement of a unit or force or a military asset inside another nation's specified operational area or territorial seas or territorial airspace for surveillance or intelligence gathering in times of peace, no war-no peace, or war. A characteristic feature of intrusion is that it is temporary in time and space and has to be vacated (or evicted)\". India-China Border Battle The India-China border spans over 3,488 kilometres, according to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs' Annual Report 2019-20 . China also claims approximately 90,000 sq kms of Indian territory in Arunachal Pradesh, and has occupied approximately 38,000 sq kms of Indian territory in Ladakh, said Minister of State for External Affairs Vellamvelly Muraleedharan in Lok Sabha on March 11, 2020. China is also in possession of 5,180 sq kms of Indian territory in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir due to the China-Pakistan 'Boundary Agreement' dated March 2, 1963, Muraleedharan told the lower house of Parliament. However, there is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and China, said Shripad Naik, former MoS for Defence, on November 27, 2019. Naik also said that India and China both \"have differing perceptions of LAC\" and \"due to both sides undertaking patrolling up to their respective perceptions of the LAC, transgressions do occur\". Who is Correct: Pramanik or Kharge? According to Pramanik, no cases of infiltration occurred along the India-China border in the last three years and Kharge contested that by bringing up Galwan violence, which he called a case of intrusion. But, in a statement on September 15, 2020, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the Chinese violated the agreement they made with India on June 6, 2020, which was to abide by the premeditated LAC. \"China does not accept the customary and traditional alignment of the boundary between India and China\" and that, as of September 15, 2020, there was \"no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and China and there is no common perception of the entire LAC\", Singh told Lok Sabha. The Union minister also mentioned the Galwan Valley violence and said there was a face-off between the two sides. \"The Chinese side had taken action to hinder the normal, traditional patrolling pattern of our troops in the Galwan Valley area,\" said Singh. While adding that while the situation was being addressed, as per the provisions of agreements between the two nations, he said, \"Chinese side made several attempts to transgress the LAC in other parts of the Western Sector. This included Kongka La, Gogra and North Bank of Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded to appropriately by our armed forces.\" Singh also explained the reason for the clash. \"Given the growing friction along the LAC, the Senior Commanders of the two sides in a meeting on June 6, 2020 agreed on a process of disengagement that involved reciprocal actions. Both sides also agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However, in violation of this the Chinese side created a violent face off on June 15 at Galwan. Our brave soldiers laid down their lives and also inflicted costs including casualties on the Chinese side\". Former MoS Naik had also told Lok Sabha in 2019 that between 2016 and 2018, there were 1,025 transgressions by the Chinese soldiers, with no casualties reported. The definition, Singh's statement and numbers presented by Naik altogether show that since both countries do not agree upon the LAC and there is a difference in perception of the border, the Chinese actions can be categorised as acts of transgressions and not intrusion or infiltration. FactChecker tried contacting Pramanik, Kumar, and Khagre for clarification, but while the office of Pramanik asked to be sent an email, the other two did not respond to calls. We have emailed all of them and this story will be updated as and when we receive a response.\n",

            "[Evidences]:About this rating The viral video did not show the biggest library in France being burned down by rioters. Instead, it showed a Manila Central Post Office in the Philippines on fire in May 2023. On July 5, 2023, multiplesocial media users and websitesshared a video allegedly showingthe biggest library in France being burned down by rioters. Although the video was authentic, it didn't show a fire related to the massive protests in the aftermath of the shooting of a 17-year-old in Nanterre during a police check. The viral video showed a Manila Central Post Office in the Philippines that broke out in May 2023. (Twitter user @roller2426, Manila Bulletin) Google Maps and news reports from various sources such as Manila Bulletin(the Philippines' largest English-languagenewspaper),CNN Philippines,and Reuters confirmed our findings. The miscaptioned video most probably spread because of the authentic events that took place in Marseille, France. The Bibliothèque l'Alcazar, a library in Marseille, was, in fact, attacked by the rioters due to the massive protests. But it didn't burn down, and as of June 5, 2023, the library has reopened,as various local newspapers reported. Here's what the library in Marseille looks like. (Google Maps screenshot of Bibliothèque l'Alcazar) Given that the verified video visually matches pictures of the Manila Central Post Office and not the library inMarseille, we rate the claim as \"Miscaptioned.\" One of the Twitter users who shared the footage from the Philippines claiming it showed the library in Marseille admitted it did not show the situation in France. One user commented, \"take down the click bait wrong video and repost the correct one,\" as the miscaptioned footage gained much more attention than its correction. Sorry for the wrong video this is the original video of Marseille library pic.twitter.com/mya1nnweuA — Ajit Gautam (@gautam21ajit) July 5, 2023 Since the beginning of the protests in France in late June 2023, Snopes has debunked multiple false claims on the topic.Another video that went viral allegedly showed dozens of cars being set on fire by French protesters. In reality, it showed a fire incident that occurred at an auction yard in Perth, Australia, in April 2023. What's more, some social media users claimed that France had restricted \"all internet access\" across the country.That rumor wasfalse, and the French Interior Ministry's Twitter accountpostedthat a document attributed to the ministry was fake and that no such decision had been made.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Charlie Crist \"attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:One of the most prevalent attacks against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is that he abandoned the Republican Party and decided to run for the U.S. Senate as a no-party candidate out of political expediency and nothing more.He heard it from both Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek in their Oct. 24, 2010, debate on CNN.But Crist countered that his decision had more to do with a far-right shift in the Republican Party. \"The Republican Party and the right wing of that party went so far right. It's exactly why Marco Rubio stayed there (and) it's exactly the same reason that I left,\" Crist said. \"He wants to overturn -- listen to me, women watching -- overturn Roe v. Wade. He does not support stem cell research. You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with.\"The line produced one of many heated exchanges between Rubio and Crist. Rubio, in his rebuttal, tried to point out Crist's hypocrisies.\"We don't need to go down the long and torturous road of the governor's change on positions and so forth. That's been well-documented,\" Rubio said. \"I mean, I do think it's curious that he attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary and we were debating together on Fox News.\"We previously have analyzed Crist's flip-flopping on things like oil drilling, the federal health care bill and even a controversial education bill that Crist vetoed in 2010. But what struck us in this case was that Rubio not only accused Crist of flipping on issues, but then brazenly criticizing Rubio for positions Crist himself held not too long ago. Our gameplan is to start the search where Rubio suggested, a Fox News debate back on March 28, 2010. But we also think it's fair to at least examine other Crist attacks that didn't come up in the March Fox debate.Looking back at Crist-R, circa March 2010Much of the Fox debate, moderated by Chris Wallace, focused on Crist and Rubio arguing about Rubio's personal finances. (Some things never change).But when it came to policy issues, the debate largely covered four topics -- jobs and the economy, Social Security, health care and immigration. What we found might actually surprise you -- Crist's statements then and now are very consistent.Both in March and this month, he said he would support the idea of raising the eligibility age for Social Security. Then and now, he said he supported the federal stimulus program. Then there's his answers on immigration. They are nearly identical. He said both in March and during the October CNN debate that the country needed to first secure or seal the border and enforce the laws now on the books. Then, in both instances, he talked about a way to gain citizenship for people now living here illegally. \"If they have the opportunity to gain citizenship, they should go to the back of the line, go through the regular process, what the law requires, in order to attain their citizenship,\" Crist said on March 28 as a Republican. Then on Oct. 24 as an independent: \"People should have to get in the back of the line, pay a fine if necessary, their back taxes, and be able to become productive members of the American economy. It's a compassionate way.\" In matters of policy, the closest PolitiFact Florida could come in finding a difference between March and now comes in discussing the federal health care bill. On March 28, Crist he would vote to repeal the bill. In an Oct. 6 ABC debate, Crist said he was against the health care bill and said it needed to be fixed (health care wasn't discussed during the CNN debate). In other cases, he said the health care bill should be repealed but be accompanied by a responsible substitute.Meek is attacking Rubio for wanting to repeal the health care bill, but Crist isn't.Claims about abortion, stem cell research Without much to go on from the Fox News debate, we turned to two attacks Crist levied against Rubio directly during the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate -- that Rubio wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and that he opposes embryonic stem cell research. Did Crist once oppose stem cell research? Did Crist once want to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in America?On embryonic stem cell research, Crist generally has been supportive of it. When he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006, Crist said he favored embryonic stem cell research. The position put him at odds with former President George W. Bush. And in May 2010, Crist vetoed state budget language banning tax dollars from being used to support human embryonic stem cell research.Crist's record on abortion, however, is more difficult to decipher. But not necessarily on overturning Roe vs. Wade.When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. \"I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,\" he said. In a subsequent debate, he said he would not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion -- essentially overturning Roe vs. Wade.In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade. \"I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,\" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.In the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist said he would support \"pro-life\" legislation like tax credits and subsidies for parents who adopt. He didn't answer questions about Roe vs. Wade.So Crist is attacking Rubio on both stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, but there is no evidence his position has changed on those issues since the spring.Gay adoption Rubio has used this line about Crist attacking him before. During an ABC News debate earlier in October, Crist chastised Republicans like Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint for telling people \"who they should love and who they shouldn't.\" In that context, Crist said he supported a court's decision to lift a ban in the state on gay couples adopting a child. That prompted Rubio to respond. \"I think it’s always funny to listen to the Governor attack me for positions he himself held just six months ago, when he was trying to be the biggest conservative in the world and win the Republican primary.\" Crist's accusation meets our definition of an attack.And it turns out Crist himself in the past has supported the gay adoption ban.That's our definition of a flip.Back in 2006, when he running for governor as a Republican, Crist said that \"my position is the traditional family is the best to adopt.\" The comments came after earlier comments suggested he might support lifting the ban and allegations from Republicans like former state Rep. Dennis Baxley that he supported gay adoptions.And then on one day in July 2009, he told reporters two different things. When one group of reporters asked if he would support legislation to change the law, he said, \"I'd have to think about it.\" Later in the day, he said he supported the ban. \"I think Florida has it right right now,\" he said.In February 2010, just eight months ago, Crist's office confirmed to the Orlando Sentinel that he supported the ban.Crist defends the differing positions by saying he was simply enforcing the laws on the books of the state. That's a weak argument. Laws change all the time. At the behest of leaders.Rubio's responseTo add to its case, the Rubio campaign sent us back to that Fox News debate, and the discussion of Social Security. One of the criticisms Crist consistently has made against Rubio, and a claim that PolitiFact has analyzed, is that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits.Crist said during the Fox debate that he would not raise the retirement age or change cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries and proposed one of the ways to help keep Social Security solvent is to cut waste and fraud. But the moderator didn't think eliminating waste and fraud was a practical solution and pressed further.\"Don't you actually have to make some benefit changes if you're going to deal with this debt issue?\" Fox's Wallace asked.\"Well, I think you might have to make some,\" Crist answered. \"But I think what you want to do first is get the waste and the fraud out.\"Crist clearly was against raising the retirement age and against benefit adjustments based on his answers. When he was pressed about the effectiveness of his plan to fix Social Security, he said some benefits changes might be needed. But then quickly said his plan — get the waste and fraud out — could work. We think it's a stretch to use an answer he was pressed into giving as evidence of a flip-flop.Rubio's campaign also noted that Crist went from being a proud Republican to essentially attacking much of the Republican Party for a far-right ideological shift. We won't disagree with that. But we're focusing on policy issues here.Our rulingMake no mistake: Crist is ripe for attacks about flip-flopping. We've already pretty much written a book about it, noting that his position on oil drilling has shifted, as has his position on the federal health care bill. He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee.But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago.There, the case is much more difficult to make.When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio.But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme.The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument.Overall, we think Rubio's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. So we rate this claim Barely True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A 2015 video showing then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has been making the rounds online with claims that he was depicted inappropriately touching a young girl. Biden has been accused of such behavior around young girls numerous times over the course of his political career. Snopes readers asked us if Biden pinched the nipple of a girl in the video, who many said was Maria Piacesi, the niece of Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana. While the video was from the 2015 swearing-in ceremony of the senator, it gained new prominence in 2021 when right-leaning blogs published screenshots reportedly from the TikTok account of Piacesi, in which she appeared to confirm that Biden did indeed pinch her nipple. Maria Piacesi speaks out about how Joe Biden pinched her nipple when she was 8 years old. Maria is the niece of Montana Senator Steve Daines. pic.twitter.com/O9DMyQ9lTy — djcalligraphy ⚪ (@DJcalligraphy) July 24, 2021 We looked at the actual video on CSPAN, and around 1:21:10, it shows Biden with his hand on the girl’s shoulder as they pose for a picture. The girl in the video, according to the Billings Gazette, a Montana newspaper, was indeed Maria Piacesi, but whether Biden did anything else to her is up for debate. In one moment she is seen shifting away from Biden’s hand, which remains on her shoulder, and then his hand moves lower toward her arm. It is unclear if Biden did anything to Piacesi, and any claims since then have been conjecture based on interpreting a few hand movements in the video. But screenshots purportedly from Piacesi’s TikTok account claim the touching did take place. According to right-leaning blog Gateway Pundit and Australian media outlet Poptopic: “Did Joe Biden pinch you?” A user by the name of Jonathan Pasetti asked, to which Piacesi responded, “Yes.” However, soon after, she deleted her comment. “Why did you delete the comment?” Pasetti asked. “I have friends that would no longer be friends with me if they knew that,” Maria Piacesi replied.[…]Maria Piacesi then sent the user a direct message via the TikTok app and said that she’s wanted to speak out about her assault but that she fears that she won’t be believed and will be seen as an outcast. “I would do something about it — to be honest — if I thought it would help, but it would only make more people angry and I’ve already had people calling me out saying I’m lying and this is BS [bullsh*t], even though it is not. I just don’t think it would help with anything right now,” Maria Piacesi said. Poptopic added that after the screenshots went viral, Piacesi deleted her social media accounts: We’ve received a lot of emails regarding this article. A lot of people believe that the screenshots are fake and no such account exist. However, upon doing some digging we can, in fact confirm, that the senator’s niece did own this account. Shortly after the news went viral she deactivated her Instagram and TikTok account. We looked for her username on TikTok as per the purported screenshots, and found an account with 71 followers that had been deleted. Based on archived pages, the account appeared to have been active in July 2021. We also have been unable to confirm if the screenshots were real. We attempted to contact this TikTok account directly to confirm if the information above was true, but the account is not following anyone and so it could not receive messages from us. We cannot at the moment confirm that this account actually belongs to Maria Piacesi. To this day there is no concrete evidence, formal accusation, or actual investigation to support such claims against Biden, only speculations based on the video and photographs. The Biden administration has responded to other accusations of improper behavior that were derived from photographs and video of public events where he was seen to be close to young girls. In 2020 Donald Trump Jr. shared an Instagram post implying Biden was a pedophile. In response, Andrew Bates, Biden’s spokesperson said: “No repulsive, manipulative tactic will change the subject from how almost 90,000 Americans have paid for Donald Trump’s coronavirus negligence with their lives and how the booming economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration is now suffering from depression-level job losses.” Biden also called Don. Jr’s pedophilia post “sick” and added, “But he is his father’s son.” Until more information is made public by Piacesi herself, the Biden administration, or through a formal police investigation, we rate this claim as “Unproven.” Sources: Hoft, Jim. “SICK: Girl Who Was Touched by Creeper Joe Biden on Camera Confirms He Groped Her and Pinched Her Nipple #MeToo.” The Gateway Pundit, 4 Aug. 2021, https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/08/sick-girl-touched-creeper-joe-biden-camera-confirms-groped-pinched-nipple-metoo/. “’It’s Sick’: Biden Blasts Trump Jr.’s Pedophilia ‘Joke.'” Sports.yahoo.com, 19 May 2020. https://sports.yahoo.com/biden-trump-jr-pedophilia-obamagate-its-sick-yahoo-town-hall-013244866.html.

            "[Evidences]:Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke about former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's crime policies during his speech on policing on Aug. 16. (Video: The Washington Post) Gift Article Share “Good policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.” — Donald Trump, speech about America’s inner cities and black communities, Aug. 16, 2016 Trump cited crime statistics that were unusually high, and raised our suspicion. He cited former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and attributed the decline in violent crime and homicide in the city to his policies. But Trump exaggerates the figures by cherry-picking the time frame, and his campaign didn’t provide any proof about how Giuliani’s specific policies affected the crime rates. Below are the facts. The Facts Giuliani was New York City mayor from 1994 to 2002. In 1994, the violent crime rate in New York City was 1,860 per 100,000, and the homicide rate was 21.3 per 100,000, according to FBI data. In 2002, the violent crime rate fell to 927.5 per 100,000 (57.6 percent decline), and the homicide rate fell to 7.3 per 100,000 (65.7 percent decline). Advertisement The figures Trump used for the decline in violent crime and homicide rates were each about 18 percentage points more than the FBI figures. What gives? According to a campaign representative, Trump was using figures from 1994 to 2014, because “Mayor Giuliani’s policies were carried out from the start of his tenure through [former Mayor Michael] Bloomberg’s tenure.” The official would not clarify exactly which policies Trump is referring to, or provide proof as to how the policies led to the decline in crime figures. Using 1994 to 2014 as the time frame, FBI and New York Police Department figures are closer to the numbers that Trump used: about 74 percent decline in violent crime and about 82 percent decline in homicides. This is problematic. First, it’s a disputed assumption to make that Giuliani’s policies — Trump is most likely referring to stop-and-frisk — brought down the crime and homicide rates. Then the Trump campaign applies this to the 12-year period after Giuliani left office — making the bizarre assumption that whatever policy implications existed under Giuliani remained unchanged for 12 years after he left office and under a different administration. And it assumes that nothing else that happened between 1994 to 2014 contributed to the decline in crime and homicide rates. Advertisement Moreover, crime was already falling before Giuliani took office. FBI data show that the violent crime rate started falling in 1989 and continued to decline until Giuliani took office in 1994. The homicide rate also started its decline in 1990. So whatever policies Giuliani put in place were enacted in addition to a trend that began about four years before he became mayor. New York was among many other major cities that saw the same decline in crime starting in the 1990s. There are many theories as to why crime started falling around this time. Many criminal justice experts say that crime rarely has a single cause that drives it. A number of factors, including social and demographic changes, incarceration practices and even weather, could affect crime rates during a given time period. New York significantly changed between January 1994 and December 2013 in many ways, including population, economy and gentrification, according to Ames Grawert, Justice Program counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Advertisement “If you’re looking at a single policy that was enacted, or a single mayor, to explain the remarkable decline in crime, I think you’re going to fall short,” Grawert said. Another telling element is that even after stop-and-frisk ended in 2013, crime continued to go down. If claims such as Trump’s are correct, one might expect crimes to go up at the end of stop-and-frisk. Bloomberg appointed a new police commissioner in January 2002, and the number of stop-and-frisk stops varied under the new leadership. Stop-and-frisk rapidly increased in 2006, after Giuliani left office, and the number of stops peaked in 2011. Then the number of stops began falling, until current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended the program once he took office in January 2014. Our colleague Philip Bump compiled this chart that shows the number of stop-and-frisks was not related to the violent and property crime rates: Bump explored the argument about stop-and-frisk in detail. The utility of the policy is not “disproven by the lack of correlation, just severely undermined,” he wrote. Advertisement Trump and others have cited the spike in violent crime and homicide rates in 2015, as an indication that crime is on the rise. But most criminal justice experts consider 2015 an outlier, as violent crime and homicide rates have been on a steady decline in many major cities over nearly three decades. In any case, you need more than one year of data to understand whether a real shift in crime and homicide rates has taken place. Trump cited Milwaukee’s crime trends in the same speech on inner cities. In 2015, killings in Milwaukee increased by 69 percent and 634 people were victims of nonfatal shootings, Trump said. His campaign pointed to 2015 data from the Milwaukee Police Department. Milwaukee has been an exception to the decline in crime in many U.S. cities. FBI crime data show the violent crime rate has fluctuated between 1,000 and 1,400 per 100,000 since 2005. Homicide rates increased in 2010, and saw some decline since then, but not in the same pattern as major cities such as New York. Grawert said cities like Milwaukee, which is one of the most segregated cities in America, also has experienced high unemployment and poverty, and declining population, all of which can be tied to crime rates. Advertisement So if you consider New York City crime decline a success story, Milwaukee is an example of a community that has struggled to stabilize over the years — and its fluctuating crime rates is one piece of overall volatility in the city. The Pinocchio Test Trump highlights the policies of Giuliani and directly ties the policies to the declining violent crime and homicide rates in New York City. First, Trump chooses a timeline that shows the best data possible: Between 1994, when Giuliani took office, and 2014, when stop-and-frisk ended. Giuliani left office in 2002, and a new police commissioner was appointed under Giuliani’s successor, Bloomberg. But Trump credits 12 years of New York crime rates to city leadership that took office after Giuliani. Specifically under Giuliani, the homicide rate and violent crime rate each declined about 18 percentage points less than Trump said in his speech. This is quite ridiculous; it’s the equivalent of saying the tax cuts under President George W. Bush resulted in the job growth under President Obama. Advertisement It’s debatable whether the stop-and-frisk policies had such a direct impact on crime, as Trump suggests. Crime is affected by many factors, and New York’s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time. Moreover, crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office, and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left. So it’s quite debatable that Trump can definitively give credit as he did in his speech. Without the fudging of numbers, this might have been in the realm of a Two Pinocchio rating. But stretching out Giuliani’s policies to the crime rates over 12 years after Giuliani left office tips it up to Three.

            "[Evidences]:Did 1.2 million black people earn more than R400,000 in 2014? Are social grants the main source of income for 40% of black households? And did the percentage of black judges increase by 248% between 2000 and 2012?These were some of the claims made by the head of South Africa’s Free Market Foundation. Leon Louw wrote that “despite the fact that there has been a spectacular amount of transformation [in South Africa], the established consensus is that little has changed and that whites still own everything”.President of the Progressive Professionals Forum, Jimmy Manyi, quoted many of the claims verbatim in a City Press opinion piece. Editor of the Financial Mail, Tim Cohen, shared the article on Twitter, calling it a “tour-de-force by Leon Louw”.But when Africa Check wrote to Louw asking for evidence to support the claims, it took him six weeks to provide a list of sources, but most of them did not support his claims or contained contradictory claims. He did not provide any evidence for four claims.According to Louw “almost everything you ever read or hear about what share of something blacks or whites have is false”. So far Africa Check has found a lot of Louw’s claims to be false too.IncomeClaim “The number of black people earning more than R400,000 a year grew 1,000% from 120,000 to 1.2 million between 2000 and last year; 90% are in the private sector.” Verdict unprovenAfrica Check was unable to find any evidence that supported this claim.South African Revenue Service (SARS) spokesman, Sandile Memela, told Africa Check that SARS is unable to provide a racial breakdown of taxpayers.“Race is also not a question posed on individual tax returns. Furthermore ID numbers since the mid 1990’s no longer carry the race of taxpayers and it is therefore not possible from SARS records to provide the breakdown as requested,” said Memela.SARS has a breakdown of individuals by income groups dating back to 2003. In 2003 there were 76,954 taxpayers who earned more than R400,000 per year.In 2015 the tax groupings changed and SARS no longer has a bracket for people who earn more than R400,000 a year. Their new brackets show that in 2014 1,199,990 taxpayers earned more than R300,000 per year and 480,435 taxpayer's earned more than R500,000 a year.Based on this information, Memela said it was “unlikely” that 1.2 million black people earned more than R400,000 in 2014, as just under 1.2 million people – of all races – earned over R300,000 that year. A smaller number will have earned more than R400,000 per year and not all of them will have been black South Africans.However, the SARS statistics will exclude people who either evade or avoid tax.\"The key issue is that the statistics refer only to taxable income declared and the position of a number of individuals may be different,\" national head of tax practice at law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, Emil Brincker, told Africa Check.Property ownershipClaim “Latter-day racists who demand coercive land redistribution do not know that black buying has grown to 50% of all voluntary transactions.” Verdict unprovenJudiciaryClaim “The percentage of black judges increased 248% from 25% to 62% between 2000 and 2012.” Verdict incorrectLiteracyClaim “Youth illiteracy is nearly nonexistent at 4%.” Verdict incorrectShare of ownershipWelfareClaim “Social grants are the main source of income for 40% of black households.” Verdict incorrectAdditional ReadingThe source provided by the Free Market Foundation, First National Banks’ Estate Agent Survey for last year, states that buying in “former white suburban areas” by “previously disadvantaged” population groups comprised 49.2% of total buying in 2014 - with white people’s share making up the rest.The report did not explain FNB’s methodology. Asked by Africa Check, the bank’s household and property sector strategist, John Loos, said that they survey 150 estate agents in South Africa’s six metropolitan areas each quarter.“We don’t ask for the number of buyers or transactions,” Loos explained. “Rather, we ask them to provide an estimated percentage of buyers that they experience to be ‘black’, ‘coloured…’ etc.”The survey is not nationally representative and is based on estate agents’ opinions, not transaction data. As Africa Check previously reported , South African title deeds do not list the race of owners since 1994, making it impossible to calculate the actual share of black property buying.As it stands, the claim is mathematically incorrect. The percentage increase from 25% to 62% is 148% - not 248%.To prove his claim, Louw’s office sent Africa Check a link to a May 2013 article by deputy minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, Andries Nel, who wrote that 62% of judges were black , including coloured and Indian judges. This is also the share stated in the department’s 2012/13 annual report But using these figures, the claim is still incorrect. In 2000/01, 30% of judges were black , coloured or Indian. The increase between then and 2012/13 is 107% - not 248%.IncorrectTo support this claim, Louw provided a presentation which contained an unreferenced and undated claim that “youth literacy” was 2% - not 4% as he claimed in the article.South Africa’s National Youth Policy defines the youth as people aged 14 to 35. In 2014 the General Household Survey reported that there were 21.5 million people in this age group.Service delivery statistics manager at Stats SA, Niël Roux, previously told Africa Check that the survey measures literacy through self-assessment, not a literacy test. Respondents are classified as illiterate when they report that they have a lot of difficulty reading and writing, or are unable to read or write.According to this assessment, 1.5% of South Africa’s youth were illiterate.Stats SA also releases an estimate of how many people are “functionally literate”, which refers to people who have completed at least Grade 7 of schooling. People with this level of schooling are believed to have a “ level of reading and writing which adults are thought to need in modern complex society ”.According to this definition, 12.5% of youth were considered functionally illiterate in 2014.“Blacks are approaching or have surpassed 50% in almost everything…”CorrectSouth Africa’s Council for Medical Schemes reported that in 2014 the country had 8,814,458 medical scheme members . The council is a statutory body that regulates and supervises private health financing through medical schemes.However, the council’s general manager for stakeholder relations, Elsabé Conradie, told Africa Check that they did not collect information on the race of scheme members. Data extracted from Stats SA’s 2014 General Household Survey shows that an estimated 9,624,786 people in South Africa were “covered by a medical aid or medical benefit scheme or other private health insurance” that year. Of these, 47% were African/black, 36% were white, 10% were coloured and 7% were Indian/Asian.Conradie said the Stats SA estimate was higher because it included a number of other health care insurance products.UnsubstantiatedLouw cited Vivian Atud, who was previously an economist at the Free Market Foundation. Atud told Africa Check her research was based on “public information and other privately sourced information”. She said she would send us a copy of a study to support the claims, but at the time of publishing we had not received it.In the meantime, Africa Check tried to find other data on the racial breakdown of credit card ownership in South Africa.Both South Africa’s National Credit Regulator and the South African Reserve Bank said that they did not have such information. The bank’s media coordinator, Candice Jeffreys, advised Africa Check to approach commercial banks for the information.We checked with Standard Bank, but spokesman Ross Linstrom said the bank does not require people to disclose their race when applying for a credit card.Louw said the source for the claim was the South African Institute for Race Relations , but did not provide further details.Data from Stats SA’s 2014 General Household Survey found that a total of 46.5% of black households receive grants.Service delivery statistics manager at Stats SA, Niël Roux, told Africa Check that less than a quarter (24.3%) of black households were dependent on grants as their primary source of income.https://africacheck.org/2015/10/19/comment-wheres-the-evidence-for-the-free-market-foundations-facts/https://africacheck.org/reports/more-claims-of-south-africas-spectacular-transformation-fact-checked/https://africacheck.org/reports/race-poverty-and-inequality-black-first-land-first-claims-fact-checked/\n",

            "[Evidences]:Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul has been talking to news outlets across New York State about the Covid-19 crisis. In a recent appearance on WIVB-TV in Buffalo, she talked about the availability of ventilators. Anchor Luke Moretti asked Hochul: \"What’s the situation with the ventilators? I know there was that bit of a back and forth between upstate, downstate a little while ago? Where do we stand right now? Are we in good shape with ventilators?\" \"Well, we always have been in good shape with ventilators,\" Hochul replied. Gov. Andrew Cuomo \"was simply trying to get an inventory to see if there are communities where there is a surplus of ventilators and he was simply saying if we can share 20 percent of your excess, your non-used ventilators, to help people in other parts of the state on a voluntary basis, that would be great. And, of course, there was a reaction to that, which was not positive, and that’s unfortunate, because I think that we always respond in a way that we look out for each other.\" She further described how first responders pitch in during snowstorms in other parts of the state, adding \"we were never going to leave anyone in Western New York without the support they need.\" She also said the urgent need for ventilators has subsided somewhat because of shipments of the breathing equipment from other states and China. We were struck that she said Cuomo was \"simply saying\" that hospitals could share their ventilators on a \"voluntary\" basis. Cuomo made clear during his daily briefing on April 3 that he intended to sign an executive order that would allow the state to move unused ventilators from one part of the state to another. The headline the Cuomo administration wrote on the day of the announcement indicated as much: \"Amid Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, Governor Cuomo Announces Executive Order Allowing State to Redistribute Ventilators & Personal Protective Equipment to Hospitals with Highest Need.\" During a press briefing, Cuomo said that more ventilators were necessary to meet the state’s needs, and that he has been working with suppliers in China. \"But we are going to have to redeploy ventilators from across the system,\" he said. \"In other words, there are hospitals that have ventilators. There are hospitals that have (personal protective) equipment. There are private-sector companies that have PPE equipment that they are not using that we are going to need to redeploy to the places in the hospitals where we need them,\" he said. Cuomo also acknowledged during the briefing that hospital administrators who would lose ventilators under his plan are upset. \"I had a conversation with a hospital administrator yesterday,\" he said. \"I understand they don't want to give up their ventilators. Ventilators are expensive pieces of equipment. I understand that, even if they're not using them, they are reluctant to see them go out the door. The theory is if the government gets them, they will never get them back. I understand that. But I don't have an option.\" He added later: \"I'm going to sign an executive order that says the state can take ventilators and (personal protective equipment) from institutions that don't need them now and redeploy them to other parts of the state and other hospitals that do need them. Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator.\" He was asked later in that briefing about how many the state would need to redeploy, and he said the state hadn’t done that calculation, but he added several hundred ventilators could be available. \"So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am,\" Cuomo said. Reaction to the plan was swift, with upstate hospital executives and elected officials expressing their concerns. Jody Lomeo, chief executive officer of Kaleida Health and chair-elect of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said that he was opposed to the executive order and would \"welcome and encourage us all to develop a more collaborative plan.\" Thomas Quatroche Jr., Erie County Medical Center’s chief executive officer and chair of the Healthcare Association of New York State, said Cuomo’s executive order, as announced, would \"place our patients and community at risk.\" The following day, April 4, Cuomo talked about taking 20 percent of a hospital’s unused ventilators. The executive order that Cuomo described on April 3 was never signed. On April 6, HANYS, the hospital group, said that it understood that any redeployment of equipment would be on a voluntary basis. On April 7, Cuomo signed an executive order leaving the movement of medical supplies and equipment up to the state Department of Health. It does not mention the National Guard nor 20 percent of available inventory. It states: \"DOH may shift any such items not currently needed, or needed in the short term future by a health care facility, to be transferred to a facility in urgent need of such inventory, for purposes of ensuring New York hospitals, facilities and health care workers have the resources necessary to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribute them where there is an immediate need.\" In reaction to the order that Cuomo did sign, hospital executives, such as Lomeo, and elected officials, such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said they were pleased by the change. Quatroche Jr., of ECMC and HANYS, said: \"We are pleased the governor’s executive order gives the commissioner of health the ability to work collaboratively with hospitals to identify needs across New York State and provide resources in ‘real time.’\" Hochul's answer to Moretti, the news broadcaster, came on April 8, one day after Cuomo signed an executive order that hospital executives found to be more cooperative than how the governor initially described it. We reached out to Hochul’s office, and her spokesperson, Bryan Lesswing, said: \"The lieutenant governorwas giving a status update on New York State's close coordination with hospitals to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, calling for state unity not division, and reinforcing Western New York's preparedness. Any other characterization is simply untrue and an unfair attack while New York State government officials have been consistently transparent in keeping New Yorkers updated with the latest facts.\" Hochul’s office also said that there was nothing contradictory in what Hochul said because the state was indeed working with hospitals to share equipment on a voluntary basis, and that she was speaking broadly about the current status with ventilators and then talked about the dialogue between upstate and downstate in Moretti’s question. Hochul said Cuomo was simply saying that hospitals could share 20 percent of their unused ventilators on a voluntary basis. That’s not how hospital executives and other elected officials heard Cuomo describe his initial plan, thus explaining the immediate backlash. And those who listened to the governor’s televised briefing heard him say this: \"So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am.\" Parsing that quote to find any semblance of \"voluntary\" is beyond challenging. Cuomo said the state would move hospital equipment from one part of the state to harder-hit areas that desperately needed them because of the Covid-19 outbreak. When the plan changed, after significant backlash, hospitals and others praised the administration for acting collaboratively. Hochul misled viewers about what happened.

            "[Evidences]:It is an unfortunate but well known fact that the city of Cleveland owns one of the highest poverty rates for any big city in the United States. At 34 percent, Cleveland is the third poorest for cities with a population of at least 200,000 people, behind Detroit and San Bernardino, Calif., according to 2010 U.S. Census data. And about 53 percent of all people under 18 in Cleveland live in poverty.Still, a recent comment by state Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat who represents one of the poorest areas of the city, was startling.During a news conference at the Statehouse on March 21 to express support for legislation that would revamp how the Cleveland Metropolitan School District operates, Williams rattled off a list of disturbing traits for students studying in schools with subpar academic performance. She also noted poverty as a factor.\"So, the fact is, 31,000 kids in failing schools, 99.97 percent of the kids live in poverty that attend Cleveland public schools,\" Williams said. \"The district is majority African-American. And the 11th House district that includes most of the Cleveland public school system is the poorest district in the state of Ohio.\"PolitiFact Ohio thought that the claim that essentially every student who attends a Cleveland public school lives in poverty was worth a check.The 31,000 figure is for students attending Cleveland schools that individually have been rated as academic watch or academic emergency buildings. But the district has roughly 42,000 students and if Williams’ figure is correct, all but about 13 of those students are poor. It seems to be a stretch, even for a city and school district racked with poverty.Williams told Politifact Ohio that she got the figure from notes provided by Cleveland schools CEO Eric Gordon in preparation for the news conference. The school district said it doesn’t recall giving Williams such an exact percentage but that it believes the state lawmaker is close. The Ohio Department of Education, which also keeps similar statistics for every district in the state, says its numbers are similar to Williams’ but also not exact.So what gives?Because it has so many students who for so long have come from impoverished families, the district in 1999 began applying a federal provision allowing it to essentially claim its entire student population as eligible for free and reduced meals. The federal government agreed that it would be more cost efficient by saving on mountainous paperwork for the district to be able to claim 100 percent poverty.The criteria for that provision requires the district to have at least 80 percent of its students qualifying for the free meals. To qualify for the free meals, students had to come from poor families based upon government income guidelines. The district continues to use the designation which is renewable every four years.\"When you have such a high degree of poverty, (you) are eligible to feed all the students under the free and reduced lunch program rather than to charge fees or reduced fees for the few,\" explained school district spokeswoman Roseann Canfora.That would mean that the true number of students in poverty attending Cleveland schools is somewhere between 80 and 100 percent. Canfora said the district could not provide an exact percentage.The state Education Department does its own calculations based on information it receives from the school district, said spokesman Patrick Gallaway. He said the state considered 89 percent of Cleveland students eligible for free and reduced meals for the 2010-11 school year, the most recent data available.But Gallaway said the state also does a separate poverty calculation it calls the economically disadvantaged flag. By that calculation, Gallaway said the state considers 95 percent of Cleveland schools students living in poverty. The economically disadvantaged number includes students who might not have filed an application for free and reduced meals but are known to come from households that would qualify, perhaps because there is an application on file for a sibling.\"The economically disadvantaged flag is more broad and could capture students who may not be included in the free and reduced totals,\" Gallaway said. \"That is the recommended figure if someone is looking to show the percentage of economically disadvantaged in a district.\"So where does that leave us with Williams’ statement?The district’s calculation used for determining eligibility for free and reduced-price meals puts the poverty figure somewhere between 80 and 100 percent and guesses the actual number could be in the high 90-percent range.A separate calculation by the state puts the figure at 95 percent.Williams is partially accurate. She clearly is correct that poverty is a significant problem in the Cleveland school district. But based on the figures supplied by the school district and the state, it appears Williams’ figure is overstated.PolitiFact Ohio is not in the business of playing Gotcha! But the difference between Williams’ precise figure and the percentages the state came up with mean that there could be thousands fewer students living in poverty. That’s an important detail.Her figure of 99.97 percent would mean all but roughly 13 students in the district live in poverty.If the state’s 95 percent figure is correct, that would mean about 2,100 students are not living in poverty. If the poverty percentage is at 89 percent (the figure the state used for students eligible for free and reduced meals for the 2010-11 school year), it would mean 4,600 students are not living in poverty.On the Truth-O-Meter, Williams’ claim rates Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Pokémon\" in Pokémon GO will scream whenever a player is within one mile of a registered sex offender.\n",
            "[Evidences]:On 28 July 2016, the satirical siteClickholereported that after Niantic issued an update to the popular Pokémon GO app, Pokémon characters in the game would scream when players approached within one mile of any registered sex offender: There’s no denying that Pokémon Go fever is sweeping the world, but its innovative real-world gameplay has already raised real-world safety concerns for its players. That’s why the game’s developer, Niantic, just went above and beyond with their latest update: Pokémon will now scream when players are within a mile of a registered sex offender! Awesome. Now everyone can become a Pokémon master without fear! The new patch seamlessly integrates data from the national sex offender registry with Pokémon Go’s augmented reality gameplay, keeping players safe without obtrusive pop-ups. Any wild Pokémon that you encounter within a one-mile radius of a known sex offender now let out a full-throated howl through your phone’s speakers, letting you know to stay alert on your quest to catch ’em all. Many confused the satire with reality on2 August 2016,after New York’sgovernor Andrew Cuomo announcedthat registered sex offenders in the state were banned from playing the augmented reality gameas a condition of their sentences: The new restriction, which will apply to nearly 3,000 sex offenders currently on parole, comes after a recent report by state Sens. Jeffrey Klein and Diane Savino. Over the month since Pokémon Go has been available for download, they showed that children have been found to encounter the properties and surrounding areas of sex offenders’ homes. New York state bans sex offenders on parole from using social media. It also has an agreement with 40 social media and related technology companies that allows it to update these companies with weekly records of registered sex offenders for social networks to ban. But with Pokémon Go, the agreement doesn’t hold up. Although the mobile game allows users to interact with others also playing at the same time, it’s not considered a social media platform. Cuomo sent a letter to Niantic, the game’s developer, offering it one of these partnerships, as well as the most updated sex offender data. “Software developers that operate mobile games like Pokémon GO should be entitled to the same information that is regularly shared with companies like Facebook, Apple and Microsoft,” the governor said in the letter. It’s probablethat some readers confused the real-life news about Gov. Cuomo’s Pokémon GOban for sex offenders with Clickhole‘s satirical article.

            "claim [Claim]: No, 2014 video does not show children who were forced to kill and eat babies by a satanic cult\n",
            "[Evidences]:IN SHORT: A video of children making claims of satanic cult abuses has resurfaced, nearly a decade after it first appeared. But a court ruling and several fact-checking organisations have debunked these claims, finding that the children were pressured into making the accusations by their mother and her partner. A video circulating on Facebook and other social media platforms shows two young children describing disturbing acts that they were subjected to or forced to commit. Among other things, the children describe being sexually assaulted and forced to kill and eat babies. This video was shared in May 2023, which was when Africa Check was alerted to it via WhatsApp, along with claims of a satanic cult abusing children. Yet none of this is true. The video was filmed in 2014, and while the story behind it is still upsetting, there is no truth to the claims the children are making. Children abused and forced to lie to authorities by mother and her partner The children in the video were never involved in any kind of satanic cult, were not abused by school teachers or members of their local church, and were not forced to kill or eat babies. Instead, an investigation by British police and social services discovered that the children had been abused by their mother, Ella Draper, and her partner, Abraham Christie. Draper and Christie forced the children to make false statements to police and authorities about ritual abuse . The investigation began in September 2014 shortly after claims of abuse were reported to the police by Christie's brother-in-law. Police searched the places where cult activities had supposedly taken place and the children were interviewed by police and examined by a paediatrician and child psychiatrist. A March 2015 judgement found that: \"The children's false stories came about as the result of relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse.\" The judge wrote that \"torture is the most accurate way to describe what was done by Mr Christie in collaboration with Ms Draper\". The hearing also found : \"There was no satanic or other cult at which babies were murdered and children were sexually abused.\" Christie and Draper had accused the children's father and school teachers, among others, of taking part in the abuse. But this was not true. Details reported on extensively, false claims already debunked One of the most unusual aspects of this claim is that the facts of the case have been known for some years and widely reported. Local and international news organisations reported the outcome of the March 2015 judgement at the time. The judgement itself is extremely clear. And fact-checking organisations have debunked the claims when they have been repeated in the years since. Hoaxed , a 2022 podcast presented by journalist Alexi Mostrous , re-told the story and conducted new interviews. Mostrous noted that, since the original claims were made, conspiracy theories about satanic cults abusing children have become more popular. The Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories, both of which have been repeatedly disproven , revolve around similar claims. Fact-checkers have also reported this. When fact-checking organisation Lead Stories investigated an old video of the children in 2020, it noted that it was tagged with #Pizzagate and other hashtags commonly used by conspiracy theorists such as #SaveTheChildren , a hashtag hijacked by QAnon conspiracy theorists. There is no evidence for the disturbing acts described by the children in this video.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share “As Republicans try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they should be reminded every day that 36,000 people will die yearly as a result.” — Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), in a tweet, Jan. 12, 2017 With the fate of the Affordable Care Act hanging in the balance, the rhetorical warfare is only going to get worse. Earlier this week, we looked at an exaggerated GOP claim about Obamacare premiums. Then this tweet caught our eye: As Republicans try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they should be reminded every day that 36,000 people will die yearly as a result. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 12, 2017 How is this number calculated and is it credible? The Facts For context, more than 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2015, or nearly 7,200 per day. So Sanders is suggesting repeal of the law would increase the number of deaths by 1.4 percent. Sanders obtained the figure of 36,000 from a calculation by ThinkProgress, a left-leaning website, according to his aides. Essentially, ThinkProgress assumed that repeal will result in 29.8 million people losing their insurance and that one person will die for every 830 people who lose their insurance. That yields a number of 35,903. Advertisement So this is an estimate based on two other estimates. How credible are the other two estimates? The Obama administration says that about 20 million people have gained insurance because of the ACA. We’ve done some digging on this number — some conservative analysts have raised questions about it — but it generally seems in the ballpark. Surprisingly, more of the increase in coverage comes from the expansion of Medicaid, not the creation of the exchanges for individual insurance. The larger number of 29.8 million comes from an Urban Institute report that assumes Republicans will repeal parts of the law through the reconciliation process without outlining any replacement plan, thus leading to a near collapse of the nongroup insurance market. That’s a pretty big assumption. Moreover, one cannot assume that everyone will automatically lose coverage. One recent study has indicated that nearly 30 percent of the gain in the insured came from people who were already eligible for Medicaid. This is known as the “woodworker” effect. In theory, these people still would be eligible even if the expansion of Medicaid was repealed, though the authors of the report dispute that, saying the woodworker effect took place precisely because of policies in the law. Advertisement In any case, nearly 30 million is certainly a high estimate. The other part of the calculation is even more problematic. It stems from a study on the effect of the Massachusetts health-care law implemented by then Gov. Mitt Romney, not the Affordable Care Act. The study compared changes in mortality rates for adults from 2001-2005 to the rates in 2007-2010, after the law was implemented. The research indicated that for every 830 adults who gained insurance, there was one fewer death per year. But the study clearly noted that “we do not have individual-level insurance information and thus cannot directly link mortality changes to persons gaining insurance coverage.” Moreover, it said the results could not be directly applied to the Affordable Care Act because “Massachusetts differs from the rest of the nation, including lower mortality, higher income and baseline insurance coverage rates, fewer minorities, and the most per capita physicians in the country.” Advertisement There are wrong ways and right ways to cite this kind of data. When the White House Council of Economic Advisers in December cited the report, it appropriately noted that it was based on data from Massachusetts: “If experience under the ACA matches what was observed under Massachusetts health reform, an estimated 24,000 deaths are already being avoided annually.” But Sanders not only directly applied the formula to the ACA, but he also assumed that withdrawing insurance would have the same impact as adding insurance. Benjamin Sommers, the lead author of the study, said: “You’re right that giving insurance versus taking it away may not produce mirror image effects — that adds further uncertainty to the discussion.” Sommers, who helped implement the ACA as an Obama administration official in 2011-2014, said applying the formula could produce “a reasonable ballpark estimate of what is a difficult question to answer, but it’s clearly not a definitive fact.” He added that Sanders’s tweet was “not a very nuanced assessment. Twitter isn’t the best venue for assessing complex research findings.” Advertisement Warren Gunnels, a Sanders policy aide, also pointed to a detailed 2009 study that estimated that out of every 1 million people without insurance, 1,000 will die because they lacked insurance. The study followed a group of patients for 12 years and found that those without insurance had a higher rate of mortality. Roughly speaking, if all 20 million people who gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act lost it, that would mean 20,000 deaths. Not only is that about half as much as the figure touted by Sanders, but it also assumes Republicans will simply leave everyone now covered without health insurance. The Pinocchio Test Certainly, the impact of changes in the health-insurance market on the death rate is an important issue in the debate over Obamacare, especially if Republican pledges to keep everyone covered fall short. But the Fact Checker often warns readers to be wary of scare statistics that lack context. Advertisement Sanders has tweeted as a definite fact an estimate that a) assumes Republicans will gut Obamacare without a replacement b) assumes the worst possible impact from that policy and c) assumes that data derived from the Massachusetts experience can be applied across the United States. Those are three very big assumptions. Take away any one of them, and Sanders’s claim that repeal of the law will cause 36,000 people to die a year falls apart. Ordinarily, this sort of fuzzy math would be worthy of at least Three Pinocchios. But ThinkProgress, in calculating the number, at least said this many people “could” die. Sanders instead stated it as a definitive fact — that 36,000 will die. That tips this claim into Four-Pinocchio territory.

            "[Evidences]:The former finance minister was fairly accurate in his speech, correctly quoting the extent of Kenya's public debt and overall GDP and highlighting Kenyans' reliance on mobile  lending service Fuliza. While Kenyan debt is concerning, we could find no evidence that more than 50% of revenue collected is spent on repaying debt and Mudavadi is off the mark about agriculture's contribution to GDP by at least four percentage points. Mudavadi wasn't being overly boastful about having established the national revenue authority and made the central bank independent in the 1990s – these developments took place under his purview as finance minister from 1993 to 1997. On 23 January 2022, opposition politician Musalia Mudavadi accepted his party's nomination for the Kenyan presidency. Promising to fix the economy, he made a hard-hitting speech that played up his legacy as finance minister in the 1990s and tore into the economic policies of the current government. He said that if his Amani National Congress (ANC) party ascended to power, he would stem what he called a tide of economic mismanagement. Mudavadi has teamed up with Kenya's deputy president William Ruto as the campaigning for 9 August 2022 elections hots up. We identified 10 claims he made in the speech. His s pokesperson Kibisu Kabatesi told Africa Check all the data Mudavadi used was from \"the one credible source of government data, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics \". But was he accurate? We went digging. Kenya's parliament approved a debt ceiling - the maximum the country can borrow -   of KSh9 trillion on 9 October 2019 . \"Kenya is broke,\" Mudavadi said , adding that the country risked being \"auctioned\" by international lenders. Africa Check has previously assessed claims about debt levels under the current administration. Between March 2013 and November 2016 debt rose from KSh1.79 trillion to KSh3.8 trillion. Data from the central bank of Kenya shows that as of June 2021, public debt was at KSh7.7 trillion. This means since 2013, public debt has grown by KSh5.9 trillion - or by 330%. We asked Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at Kenya's statistics bureau, where to look for the most recent debt data. He directed us to the national treasury . The most recent quarterly economic and budgetary review , published in November 2021, showed the public debt on 30 September 2021 at KSh 8 trillion. But these figures are provisional. Kenya's public debt between 2013-2021 (KSh bn) Financial year Total debt Increase in total public debt 2012/13 1.794 2013/14 2.370 576 2014/15 2.829 459 2015/16 3.618 789 2016/17 4.406 788 2017/18 5.039 633 2018/19 5.808 769 2019/20 6.694 886 2020/21 7.712 1.018 Total 5.918 Source: Central Bank of Kenya The treasury projects that by 2022/23 the country's public debt will be at KSh 9.4 trillion. Going by past trends and its own projections, debt levels have increased rapidly and could soon breach the ceiling. On this one Mudavadi was largely on the money.- Makinia Juma For data on the gross domestic product (GDP), Muchiri directed us to the bureau's annual economic surveys. GDP is a widely used measure of the total value of goods and services produced in a country during a specific period, usually a year. The most recent survey shows that GDP increased from KSh10.3 trillion in 2019 to KSh10.8 trillion in 2020. The treasury provisionally estimates that GDP was at KSh 11.3 trillion in June 2021. We therefore rate this claim as mostly correct. - Makinia Juma Data on the revenue that is used to repay debt varies from year to year, according to John Kinuthia . He is a senior programmes officer with the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership , a global budget transparency organisation. Even projections for debt payment in a financial year were different from what was actually spent, Kinuthia added. Data from the treasury shows that as of June 2020, the end of the 2019/20 financial year, 41.4% of revenue was used to repay debt. This is projected to have increased to 50% for the 2020/21 financial year. We have not seen any publicly available data that supports Mudavadi's claim that for every KSh100 revenue collected KSh70 goes towards paying Kenya's debt. We therefore rate this claim incorrect. - Makinia Juma Fuliza is a service by Kenya's largest mobile operator, Safaricom . It allows subscribers to complete mobile money transactions even when they don't have enough funds in their mobile money account - a sort of overdraft facility. The company's most recent report covers the six months between April and September 2021. It shows that KSh242.6 billion (about US$2.1 billion) was disbursed under the service. To get the daily rate, we divided this figure by the 183 days in that period. This worked out to KSh1.33 billion. We rate the claim mostly correct -Tess Wandia Mudavadi said Kenyans were \"fugitives from Fuliza\" after borrowing KSh351 billion (US$3.1 billion) the previous year. Data from Safaricom shows that in the full year ending March 2021, KSh351.2 billion was disbursed through the service. - Tess Wandia Before the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) was set up, taxes were collected by disparate departments of the national treasury . The bill to set up the tax agency was introduced in the national assembly on 28 March 1995. Mudavadi served as finance minister from 1993 to 1997. According to the Hansard, a daily record of the assembly's proceedings, he initiated debate on the draft law on 20 April 1995. The law now stipulates : \"There is established an authority to be known as the Kenya Revenue Authority\" as the government agency \"for the collection and receipt of all revenue\". The agency is under the \"general supervision\" of the finance minister. The bill was signed into law on 31 May and took effect a month later. The tax agency records 1 July 1995 as the date when it was formed. Following 1997 elections Mudavadi was moved to the agriculture ministry. The idea of setting up the stand-alone tax agency was part of the reforms , popularly known as the structural adjustment programmes, recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Kwame Owino , the chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs-Kenya , told Africa Check this. \"Many people can take credit for the creation of the tax agency, including [then] president Daniel arap Moi and the parliament at the time which passed the law. Mudavadi can only take credit to the extent that he was finance minister at the time … but KRA is a creation of the law,\" Owino said. While it would have been a team effort, Mudavadi as the political head for the finance ministry steered the bill that created the revenue authority through parliament. The agency was subsequently set up during his tenure when he had statutory oversight of its work. We therefore rate this claim mostly correct. – Alphonce Shiundu In a 2021 book he has co-authored and co-edited, incumbent Kenya central bank governor Patrick Njoroge defines independence of central banks as autonomy of the bank to do its work without political interference. The book, 50 Years of Central Banking in Kenya, records that the independence of the Kenyan central bank was \"grossly compromised\" before the 1996 changes to the law that governs the bank and its operations. Mudavadi was the finance minister in 1996 when these reforms took place. At the time, the bank's governor was Micah Cheserem , who served between 1993 and 2001. In his book, The Will to Succeed , Cheserem says that these changes to the law were the cornerstone of the bank's independence. Cheserem also said he \"teamed up with the then\" finance minister \"Musalia Mudavadi, to effect far-reaching economic reforms\". \"Our efforts to have CBK independence bore dividends following the enactment of the CBK (amendment) Act No.9 of 1996, which enabled it to enjoy a high degree of autonomy,\" he writes. \"Other important features of the CBK independence that arose from the amendments include, limitation of the level of government influence in appointment procedures, terms of office and dismissal of the Governing Board of the bank\". The national assembly's Hansard shows Mudavadi initiated the debate on the bill to give the central bank autonomy on 20 November 1996. Further reforms came through the 2010 constitution , according to Njoroge's book. We therefore rate the claim mostly correct. -Alphonce Shiundu Mudavadi promised to create \"a debt regulatory institution within one year of the Amani National Congress government\". He said a legislator in his party, Sakwa Bunyasi , had tabled a bill to address the issue but for \"nearly one year that bill is being taken in circles because people don't want us to establish the truth of our debt\". Bunyasi has sponsored the Public Debt Management Authority Bill, 2020 which seeks to set up \"an independent body to manage the public debt\". The lawmaker wants the proposed authority to take over the mandate of the public debt management office currently under the national treasury. The bill was published on 29 October 2020. It was introduced into the national assembly on 22 December. In end-January 2022 it is yet to be slotted for debate. It has at time of writing been 13 months since the bill was introduced in the assembly. The bill tracker shows that there are at least 10 other bills introduced on the same date which have not been debated, and dozens of other bills introduced later which were debated, passed and enacted. Michael Sialai, the clerk of the national assembly , told Africa Check the bill was submitted to the finance and national planning committee. \"It is still under consideration in the committee. The report is awaited,\" Sialai said via text message. – Alphonce Shiundu The national treasury defines a stalled project as one which \"has stopped being implemented for whatever reason or has been receiving inadequate budget allocations which cannot facilitate meaningful progress over the medium term\". Kenya's auditor general releases reports every financial year , which runs from 1 July to 30 June. The year 2019 is covered in the reports for 2018/19 and 2019/20 , which is the most recent. In both, the auditor general said that \"the government has continued to incur huge expenditure on projects which had either stalled or had remained incomplete long after their completion dates had elapsed\". The projects include dams, prisons, courts, water pans and roads. In the financial year 2018/19, KSh8.8 billion in total was spent on stalled projects. In 2019/20, the amount was KSh3.9 billion . In 2019, an International Monetary Fund report showed stalled projects needed KSh1 trillion to complete. A World Bank 2020 report revealed that by 30 June 2018, there were 522 stalled projects in Kenya which required an estimated KSh1.1 trillion to complete. The parliamentary Hansard shows that in June 2021 legislators estimated the cost of stalled projects at KSh9 trillion. ( Note: We have asked the national assembly for the source of this figure and will update this report with the response .) Though Mudavadi cites the wrong source, there's publicly available evidence to back up Mudavadi's claim that billions of shillings are spent on stalled projects, and that these require KSh1.1 trillion to complete. – Grace Gichuhi The statistics bureau's most recent economic survey showed that agriculture, specifically the growing of crops, animal production and other support activities, contributed 18.8% to Kenya's GDP in 2019. The provisional estimate for 2020 was 20.4%. When combined with fishing, fish-farming and forestry, the figure jumped to 21.2% in 2019 and a provisional 23% in 2020. Mudavadi's figure is at least four percentage points off the mark. A percentage point of the current GDP works out to about KSh100 billion. We therefore rate his claim incorrect. – Dancan Bwire\n",

            "claim [Claim]: The World Health Organization reports that in 2018, 4% of deaths in Nigeria were caused by cancer.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Vice president Yemi Osinbajo said 4% of deaths in Nigeria were caused by cancer, 72,000 of the 100,000 cases reported each year resulted in death, and the country accounted for 15% of West Africa's cancer cases. His claim that the World Health Organization had estimated 4% of deaths in Nigeria were caused by cancer in 2018 was correct. He was mostly correct on the number of cancer cases and deaths each year, but his claim about Nigeria's share of West Africa's cancer burden was incorrect. At a recent ceremony, Nigeria's vice president Yemi Osinbajo launched construction of a new cancer treatment centre at the Muhammadu Buhari Specialist Hospital in the northern state of Kano . It would become Nigeria's top cancer treatment centre, Osinbajo said at the January 2020 launch, helping tackle what he described as a \"major problem\" in the country. To highlight Nigeria's cancer burden, Osinbajo made three widely reported claims. We fact-checked them. Claim The World Health Organization reports that in 2018, 4% of deaths in Nigeria were caused by cancer. Verdict correct Africa Check asked Osinbajo's media office for the source of the claims. They referred us to his official speech for the event.  While the claim that 4% of deaths were due to cancer specifically cites the WHO, the speech doesn't give clear sources for the other two claims. Nigeria does not have a country-wide cancer registry yet, Prof Ima-Obong Ekanem told Africa Check. She heads the Calabar cancer registry , one of the country's six population based cancer registries. People working in this field therefore rely on data from these registries, Ekanem previously told us. The Global Cancer Atlas would have national data on this, Prof Tanimola Akande , a consultant public health physician and professor at the University of Ilorin , told Africa Check. The atlas is prepared by the International Agency for Research on Cancer , or IARC, a specialised unit of the World Health Organization . The latest edition gives data for 2018. To estimate the number of cancer-related deaths in Nigeria, the IARC used a model based on the number of new cases and deaths from neighbouring countries . This, it said , was because Nigeria lacked data at the national level. The agency estimated that, in 2016, there were 2.13 million deaths in Nigeria, 4% of them due to cancer . So Osinbajo is correct on this score. The IARC estimated the country's often-disputed population at 186 million people. Cancer deaths under-reported In Nigeria, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Cervical cancer accounts for most cases in women, followed by breast cancer. Non-communicable diseases caused 29% of all deaths, the data showed . But most deaths, including cancer-related deaths, were under-reported in Nigeria, Akande said. The problem started at the detection stage. Cancer cases, he said, were \"under-diagnosed because of low utilisation of health services and poor health seeking behaviour. The expertise and equipment to properly diagnose cancer is also not available in most facilities.\" Akande pointed to inaccurate cause of death records as a major challenge. Reasons for this included many patients dying at home, and autopsies not being done widely. Osinbajo said he was optimistic the country's national 2018-2022 cancer plan would help reduce the burden of cancer. This US$308 million strategy seeks to improve early detection, cancer care, drug access and data collection, among other things. Claim Of over 100,000 cases that are reported in Nigeria, about 72,000 die annually of cancer. Verdict mostly-correct In our July 2018 report on how many Nigerians die from cancer every hour , we found the latest data from the IARC estimated that 71,571 people died of cancer in Nigeria in 2012. Newer data shows that the number of deaths fell slightly to 70,327 in 2018. Africa Check asked the IARC why the estimate had dropped. Spokesperson Jacques Ferlay told us  it was due to a \"change in data and method\" and not a \"true change in risk\". The agency estimated the number of reported cancer cases in 2018 at 115,950 . Osinbajo's claim is therefore in the ballpark. Claim Nigeria's cancer cases are about 15% of cases in West Africa. Verdict incorrect The vice president did not specify if he was referring to new or existing cases, or deaths. Data on this could also be found in the Global Cancer Atlas , Akande told Africa Check. The atlas gives the most recent estimate for the \"incidence\"  of cancer – new cases of the disease – in West Africa as 229,459 , in 2018. (Note: The agency counts 16 countries in the West Africa region.) Existing cancer cases The \" prevalence \" of cancer –  existing cases – in Nigeria was estimated at 211,052 over five years. This was 54% of West Africa's total of 390,756 existing cases. ( Note: Some national media interpreted Nigeria's prevalence rate as \"the highest in West Africa\". Data sent to us by the IARC showed that two other countries - Ghana and Benin - had higher prevalence rates than Nigeria's, which is currently estimated at 108 cases per 100,000 people . ) Finally, Nigeria accounts for about 46% , or 70,327, of the 153,332 cancer-related deaths in all of West Africa. None of the three estimates is 15%, as Osinbajo claimed.

            "[Evidences]:On Jan. 7, 2021, a day after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., a picture started circulating on social media that supposedly showed damage done to the Oval Office: This is not a genuine photograph of a desecrated Oval Office, and the picture predates the riot. It should also be noted that the Oval Office is located in the White House, not the Capitol. While the Capitol was vandalized during the riot, no damage was done to the White House. The above-displayed picture has been circulating online since at least November 2020 when it was shared on social media along with messages mocking U.S. President Donald Trump in the wake of his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden. This image was created by Nick den Boer, an animator, director, and digital artist who posts on social media under the handle @smearballz. This image, along with three others depicting a tarnished Oval Office, was originally posted on Twitter on Nov. 8, 2020, (the day afterBiden was declared the winner of the presidential election) along with the caption: “Aftermath.” Aftermath pic.twitter.com/mhP8ONvQHI — Nick Den Boer III (@smearballz) November 8, 2020 Another set of similar images depicting a trashed Oval Office was posted to @Smearballs Instagram page in November 2019. Den Boer explained to us that the above-displayed images are all 3D models of the Oval Office. While this is a digital creation that does not depict any actual damage done to the Oval Office, the Capitol was truly vandalized during a mob riot that included the deaths of five people. NBC News reported: Hundreds of President Donald Trump’s supporters swarmed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, leaving the halls of Congress with broken windows, vandalized walls and ransacked offices. Among the wreckage were pieces of broken furniture, battered doors and heaps of trash littering the hallway floors. A thick film of dust and tear gas residue remained throughout the building that contains the Senate and the House of Representatives. Stolen and damaged items were reported in elected officials’ offices, including the wood and gold placard above House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Former state Sen. Richard Ojeda, D-W.Va., recently lamented the toll of gun-related violence in the United States. \"I’m loving watching these GOP Senators and members of Congress saying the same old stuff concerning gun violence and listening to them get their asses handed to them by citizens that are tired of seeing 75-100 folks killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence,\" Ojeda tweeted on Aug. 20. I’m loving watching these GOP Senators and members of Congress saying the same old stuff concerning gun violence and listening to them get their asses handed to them by citizens that are tired of seeing 75-100 folks killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence. Is the number that large? When we reached out to Ojeda, he said we should look at the federal statistics and \"just do the research.\" We did, and we found that his numbers were actually an understatement. The official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the number of gun-related deaths nationally. The most recent year for which data is available is 2017. Here are the figures: Homicides: 14,542 deaths by guns Suicides: 23,854 deaths by guns Other: 1,377 deaths by guns Total deaths by guns: 39,773 That works out to 3,314 total gun-related deaths nationally per month, and 1,212 gun-related homicides per month. Both figures are much higher than Ojeda’s estimate of 75 to 100 per month. However, Ojeda’s figures would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day. There are about 109 gun-related deaths per day, about 40 of which are homicides and 65 of which are suicides. We also checked to see if the numbers work for firearm deaths in West Virginia alone. They don’t -- in this case, the number is too small. West Virginia saw 348 total deaths from guns in 2017, which works out to 29 per month, or close to one a day. What about injuries? The CDC has data on that as well. In 2015, the most recent year available, there were 84,997 non-fatal injuries by guns nationally. That works out to 7,083 per month, a number well above the 200 Ojeda cited. Here, too, the data fits better if it’s calculated on a per-day basis. There were about 233 non-fatal injuries per day. That’s not far off from the number Ojeda offered. All told, though, his numbers are far off from what he said in the tweet. Our ruling Ojeda tweeted that \"75-100 folks (are) killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence.\" In fact, Ojeda understated the number of deaths and injuries from guns. His numbers are roughly right for gun deaths and injuries per day, rather than per month. We rate his statement Mostly False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: A 2008 article proves the UN wants to starve people as a form of control\n",
            "[Evidences]:Social media users have claimed a 2008 article published by the United Nations (UN) proves the organisation is behind efforts to starve people as a form of control. The article, The Benefits of World Hunger , was written by then University of Hawaii professor of political science George Kent and appeared in the UN’s magazine, the UN Chronicle , 14 years ago. But the claim is false. AAP FactCheck tracked down the now retired professor who spent much of his career dedicated to ending world hunger. He said the article had been misunderstood and was intended to highlight fears that some in society benefit from continued world hunger. The article went largely unnoticed for 14 years following its publication however, in the last few weeks it has been picked up by numerous social media users. Among them is former Liberal National MP George Christensen who posted a link to this article which described the “op-ed” as “mounting evidence” that food shortages are being manufactured by the UN to establish a “New World Order”. Others such as the American conservative advocacy group the John Birch Society linked to this article which declared the UN had “praised” the benefits of world hunger. It has been cited countless times by other users across Facebook ( here , here and here ) and Twitter ( here , here and here ). In the article, Mr Kent makes the argument that the developed world needs to understand what causes and sustains hunger. “Hunger has great positive value to many people,” it reads. “Indeed, it is fundamental to the working of the world’s economy.” The article concludes: “For those of us at the high end of the social ladder, ending hunger globally would be a disaster. If there were no hunger in the world, who would plow the fields? Who would harvest our vegetables? Who would work in the rendering plants? Who would clean our toilets?… No wonder people at the high end are not rushing to solve the hunger problem. For many of us, hunger is not a problem, but an asset.” After many social media users claimed this was evidence of a UN agenda to prolong world hunger, the New York-based organisation pulled the article from its online archive. A UN spokeswoman described the article as an “attempt at satire” and said it was “never meant to be taken literally”. “We have been made aware of its failures, even as satire, and have removed it from our site,” she told AAP FactCheck in an email. But Mr Kent, who is now retired, refutes the UN’s suggestion it was an attempt at satire. “I certainly wasn’t trying to be funny,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email. “I don’t recall any mention of satire when I submitted the paper or at any time since then. The editors of the UN Chronicle could have asked me to clarify my intentions at any time. They did not communicate with me before or after they took my article down.” Mr Kent, who also has links with the Department of Peace and conflict studies at the University of Sydney ,  said the article was an attempt to get across why it is in the interests of some to keep large swathes of the population hungry. “My article was intended to draw attention to what I see as a simple fact: some people benefit from persistent hunger,” he said. “It is important to give attention to this point. My paper was not written as some sort of joke or as praise for persistent hunger. “The purpose of my 2008 article was to call for recognition of the fact that some people with power resist efforts to end persistent hunger because they benefit from it. That should be studied. “My intention was to call for better understanding of the problem so that we can fight hunger more effectively.” Mr Kent said he has received abusive calls and emails from around the world in recent weeks and told AAP FactCheck that he wanted to apologise for “what I now see as ambiguity of my article”. The academic has written dozens of articles, papers and books on efforts to tackle world hunger including his 2011 title, Ending Hunger Worldwide , 2005’s Freedom from Want: The Human Right to Adequate Food and 2008’s Global Obligations for the Right to Food. The UN also has well established goals on ending world hunger with its current target to “end hunger and ensure access… to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round” by 2030. The Verdict The claim that a 2008 article is proof the UN wants to starve people as a form of control is false. The author George Kent, who has dedicated much of his career to tackling world hunger, told AAP FactCheck that his article for the UN Chronicle was intended to highlight that some people benefit from persistent hunger. Mr Kent added his intention was to provide a better understanding of the issue of world hunger.

            "[Evidences]:A post on Facebook , referring to the new Emergency Alerts system , claims: \"It will be a hard one for me to let my phone go for a few hours but I won't be responding to the message! If you fancy being controlled and have your personal data accessed then reply to the message!\" This is misleading. While the alert will behave like a notification that you need to acknowledge before you can go on to use other features on your phone, this does not mean you are replying to it, as such. It also won't access your personal data. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What is the emergency alert? The Emergency Alerts government service will warn people via their phones or tablets if there's a nearby \"danger to life\", for example in the case of severe flooding, fire or extreme weather. Only emergency services and government departments, agencies and public bodies dealing with emergencies will be able to send the alerts, with advice about how to stay safe during the emergency. The system is due to be tested across the UK on Sunday 23 April . The alert will appear on devices that use 4G or 5G networks and will appear as a notification and loud siren-like sound for up to 10 seconds. The alert will need to be acknowledged The alert will not be a message that needs to be replied to, but a notification that will need to be acknowledged before you can keep using your phone. According to the government : \"It will appear on your device's home screen and you must acknowledge it before you can use other features. They appear as a notification and may include telephone numbers or website links containing further information.\" The Cabinet Office confirmed to Full Fact that phone calls won't go to voicemail if you haven't acknowledged the alert and the alert won't stop a phone call in progress. Other notifications will also still come through to your phone. However, in order to answer a call or view notifications, you will need to acknowledge the alert. The alert won't access your phone's data When an alert is triggered , all cell towers in the area concerned will broadcast the alert to connected devices. The government doesn't need to know your location or phone number to do this. The Cabinet Office confirmed to Full Fact that no personal data is collected by the alert. Misinformation about what data is being collected may lead to unnecessary alarm, and in this case, may cause people to opt out and therefore risk not being warned about nearby dangers to them. We've also checked the image in this post, which claims you won't be able to use your phone until you acknowledge the alert (which is true), but also falsely claims that when you do \"the government will know exactly which phones are active, where and be able to link them to your personal data\". We've also checked a false claim that the alerts will breach GDPR . Image courtesy of Marjan Grabowski\n",

            "[Evidences]:Fans of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be surprised to learn that, at least according to a post being shared widely on Facebook, she once advocated for lowering the age of consent to tween. \"The age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to age 12 years old,\" reads the quote attributed to \"Ruth Traitor Ginsburg\" in 1977. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is an old one, raised back in 1993 during Ginsburg’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Susan Hirschmann, executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum, then said that among Ginsburg’s \"extremist feminist concepts\" was the belief that \"the age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to 12 years old.\" Hirschmann cited \"Sex Bias in the U.S. Code,\" a report co-authored by Ginsburg and published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1977. The report mentions \"consent\" in a few places. On page 95, the report describes the current law at the time —\"it is a crime for a person to have carnal knowledge of a female not his wife who has not reached 16 years of age\" — and notes that rape was then defined as anyone \"who commits an act of sexual intercourse with a female not his wife, by force or without her consent.\" \"The ‘statutory rape’ offense is defined in these sections in much the same way,\" the report says. \"The victim must be a female and the offender a male. … These provisions clearly fail to comply with the equal rights principle. They fail to recognize that women of all ages are not the only targets of sexual assault; men and boys can also be victims of rape. In the case of statutory rape, the immaturity and vulnerability of young people of both sexes could be protected through appropriately drawn, sex-neutral proscriptions.\" The report goes on to suggest changes to the current law to remove sex bias, such as changing federal law to extend Secret Service protections to \"the spouse or surviving spouse of a woman president\" instead of just the wife or widow of the president. Toward the end of page 101, the report suggests changing another law and quotes a proposed Senate bill, which used gender-neutral language to describe the victim of a crime: A person is guilty of an offense if they compelled someone to participate in a sexual act using coercion, drugging them, or if \"the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.\" \"This report recommends alteration of pronoun usage throughout the Senate bill… to conform with the proposed sex-neutral terminology format,\" the report then says. Bottom line: The words weren’t Ginsburg’s, and they weren’t used to express support for the proposal — the purpose was to demonstrate gender-neutral language. Still, this section of the report has inspired many false claims and fact-checks over the years. In 2005, Slate published a story about the claim after Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Ginsburg \"wants the age of consent to be 12.\" \"Ginsburg and her co-author argue that the law should be rewritten to outlaw sexual abuse of any minor, male or female, by any person who is significantly older, male or female,\" Slate said. We rate this post False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A message stating Maharashtra has imposed several new restrictions over concerns due to the Omicron variant is being shared widely on social media. While there are new COVID-19 guidelines in the state the viral post is misleading. India has so far reported 83 cases of Omicron variant, which spreads faster than the previous strains of Coronavirus, with the highest in Maharashtra at 32, followed by Rajasthan at 17. It is in this backdrop that a viral forward which reads, ‘CM Uddhav Thackeray ji’s order has come out,’ on Omicron is being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook. The message further goes on to say that ‘…the timing of Vyapari shopkeeper is from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm, the shopkeeper trader and the customer are required to wear masks, the police have been exempted, if caught without a mask, the challan also explodes on you. Night curfew will continue from 9:00 pm to 5:00 am. Section144 is applicable from 15th December 2021 till 31st January 2022.’ The post has been shared several times on Facebook. Newschecker also received a request from a user on its WhatsApp helpline number (+91 9999499044), to check the veracity of this message. Screenshot of the message received by Newschecker on the WhatsApp helpline number Factcheck/Verification To check if the Maharashtra government has given orders as mentioned in the viral message, Newschecker searched for local news reports and found an article by Hindustan Times with the title, ‘Shopkeepers express shock over state’s new penalty order.’ Screenshot of Hindustan Times’ report According to the report dated November 29, shopkeepers in Maharashtra will be fined 10,000 rupees if customers ‘don’t wear masks or violate Covid rules.’ The guideline bought in the wake of the Omicron variant has faced flak from traders associations. Newschecker contacted Mahendra Pitaliya, Secretary, Federation of Trade Associations, Pune, who said, “It is true that shopkeepers will be fined 10,000 rupees if customers do not wear masks and we are requesting the government to reconsider this order.” When asked about the curfew timings for shops he said, “the government has not ordered the shop to close at 8 pm. At present, shops are allowed to remain open till 11 pm in Pune.” We then looked up news reports on section 144, which preempts gathering of five or more people in public, and found a news report by Hindustan Times titled, ‘Maharashtra Omicron cases: Section 144 imposed in Mumbai till New Year’s Eve.’ Screenshot of Hindustan Times’ article The report states that the Mumbai police has imposed section 144 in the city from December 16 to December 31 ‘banning large gatherings as part of measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease.’ But Newschecker did not find any reports stating imposition of section 144 till January 31, 2022. On contacting the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s office about Section 144 in the state till January 2022, we were told by officials that, “no such order has been issued but district collectors can take such a decision based on local conditions.” Newschecker further contacted Pune City Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ravindra Shiswe who confirmed, “no such decision has been taken by the Pune police nor has the government given any such order on section 144 due to the Omicron variant.” Conclusion Though the Maharashtra government has brought new COVID-19 guidelines in the wake of the Omicron strain, the claim that shops can run only between 9:00 am to 8:00 pm and section 144 throughout the state till January 31, 2022, are false.

            "claim [Claim]: Says Mitch McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate from Kentucky, says that as Mitch McConnell’s wealth has grown, he has hindered Kentucky’s prosperity. Recently, we looked at an ad in which Grimes said McConnell, the incumbent Senate minority leader, made millions while in public office. We rated that claim Mostly False. But that was only one of several claims in the ad that attacked McConnell for being out-of-touch with average Kentuckians and biased toward the wealthy. Another claim caught our attention: McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\" We’ve noticed that this claim -- that a candidate voted for tax breaks that send jobs overseas --is a trending talking point among Democratic candidates, and we’ve found that often the claim is simplistic and misleading. So we decided to see whether or not Grimes’ claim about McConnell stacks up. The votes The ad makes it sound as if McConnell voted three times to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing specifically. This is not the case. Forevidence for its claims, the Grimes campaign pointed us to informationon their website. All three \"no\" votes were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions. These deductionsdid not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind oftax breakfor moving employees out of the country. McConnell’s first \"no\" vote was in 2010 on the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. The second and third \"no\" votes were on the Bring Jobs Home Act, which was proposed in 2012 and again in 2014. These votes, split almost exclusively along party lines, were on procedural measures that ultimately prevented the bills from receiving a final passage vote. Both laws would have given a tax benefit to companies that insourcejobs and denied an already-existing tax break to companies that outsourcethem. The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn’t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Tax experts we spoke with said the law was almost entirely symbolic. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule, compared to corporate tax revenue overall. So minuscule, in fact, that getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company’s decision to engage in foreign activity. \"It adds up to a trivial amount of money,\" said James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan. \"Given how many big multinational firms we have, it’s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior.\" Eliminating standard deductions for costs associated with outsourcing would result in an average $14.2 million a year in revenue, according to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. That’s not much in the grand scheme of things. For some perspective, the Internal Revenue Service took in $273.5 billion in corporate income taxes in 2013 alone, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group, based on Office of Management and Budget data. Revenue from eliminating that deduction would amount to 0.005 percent of total revenue. Among Republicans’ reasons for opposing the Bring Jobs Home Act, the policy would have lost revenue and added to the deficit, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation. The government would have spent more money on the tax credit for insourcing than it would have raised by eliminating deductions related to outsourcing. Overall, the policy would have resulted in an estimated $214 million loss over 10 years. Our ruling Grimes said McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\" The ad makes it seem like McConnell voted to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing. Actually, he voted \"no\" on legislation that would have eliminated the standard business expense deductions -- which exist for all businesses -- for costs associated with outsourcing. (Current law includes no provision that specifically addresses insourcing or outsourcing.) These bills had little chance of passing, and they were largely symbolic.We rate this claim Mostly False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"The law allows me to have the N70 million in cash.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:House majority leader Alhassan Doguwa referred to Nigeria's cash shortage crisis in a recent press conference about what the law said about campaign finances. His claim that house of representatives members seeking re-election could spend a maximum of N70 million on their campaigns is incorrect. The limit applies to all candidates. And claims that candidates must spend N70 million – and must have the amount in cash – are misleading. A similar claim that a presidential candidate must spend N1 billion is incorrect – the limit is N5 billion, but candidates may spend less. Nigerians are facing a crippling cash shortage caused by the central bank's introduction of new redesigned naira notes . And lawmakers are turning up the heat on president Muhammadu Buhari. After a recent meeting with Buhari about the policy, house of representatives majority leader Alhassan Doguwa emerged to tell journalists that the new rules would disadvantage candidates in the upcoming elections. Nigerians are set to elect a president and federal lawmakers on 25 February 2023 . In October 2022, the central bank announced a redesign of the currency. The aim was to bring back money from outside the financial system, fight inflation, reduce crime and promote a cashless economy. But a severe shortage of the new banknotes has caused riots in some parts of the country and landed the federal government in court . Buhari defended the policy before he met the lawmakers. He said he was aware of the frustration it had caused, but that it had \"contributed immensely to the minimisation of the influence of money in politics\". The president has already faced stinging criticism from within his own party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). Doguwa is a member of the APC and heads a house committee on the naira swap and cashless policy. He complained to journalists about the obstacles candidates faced in their campaigns. He also made claims about campaign spending. What Nigeria reps house majority leader Alhassan Doguwa said In a 16 February 2023 media briefing, Doguwa had a lot to say about how the new cash policy was affecting electioneering. Here are some of his remarks relevant to this fact-check. \"There is a clear-cut provision in the electoral act, which provides for the amount of money needed for every political office holder to take during campaign to use. \"A member of the house of representatives is expected to have not more than N70 million [about US$150,000] to conduct his election, logistics and other things. N70 million, cash, by law. Yes. A presidential candidate, for instance, needs to have N1 billion [about $2.2 million]. \"The law has provided the amount of money we need to oversee our election process. You need to pay your agents in the villages where you don't have ATM machines, in the villages where you don't have [point of sales systems], in the villages where you absolutely don't have these new naira notes. \"This is money that I require. The law has permitted me to have N70 million as logistics for my election funding. I need to have this N70 million in hard copy, yes. That is the position of the law. And as I speak to you, I don't have it, which means if this policy continues this way, if the central bank fails to make available this money we need to fund our elections, definitely every candidate no matter what party he belongs to will be put at disadvantage.\" Doguwa has represented the Tudun Wada/Doguwa federal constituency in the northern state of Kano since 2003, and is seeking a sixth term. But did the veteran lawmaker interpret Nigeria's electoral law correctly? We examined four of his claims. Doguwa claimed that Nigeria's electoral law limits the election expenses of political office holders . He said a member of the house of representatives, for example, is not expected to have more than N70 million (US$150,000) for election expenses, including campaign logistics and polling unit agents' pay. Does the law really say this? The law Doguwa referred to is section 88 of the Electoral Act 2022, which sets limits on election expenses. It states that the maximum a candidate seeking a seat in the house of representatives can spend on election expenses is N70 million. For the senate, the maximum is N100 million (about $220,000). Nigeria's two-chambered national assembly is made up of the house and the senate . The N70 million limit Doguwa referred to applies to all candidates campaigning for a seat in the house of representatives – not only those who already hold office and are seeking re-election. Therefore we rate this claim incorrect. Doguwa said the central bank's new policy was preventing him from being able to spend the amount a house of representatives candidate was allowed for election expenses. \"The law has provided the amount of money we need to oversee our election process,\" he said. \"If the central bank fails to make available this money we need to fund our elections, definitely every candidate no matter what party he belongs to will be put at disadvantage.\" We found that neither section 88 nor any other part of the electoral law sets out the amount of money candidates must spend on campaigns or other expenses associated with getting elected. The purpose of this section of the Electoral Act is to limit the costs a candidate can incur in the process of getting elected. It doesn't dictate how much a candidate needs. That's what Bashir Ibrahim, a professor of law at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, northwest Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"It is false and misleading to claim that the law says you should have that amount. The law envisages that anyone running for office will incur costs in the process. To check the influence of money on elections, the law puts a cap, a limit on how much a candidate can spend on elections,\" Ibrahim said. It's not about what you spend \"Winning elections is not about how much you spend. A candidate can spend far less than half of the expense limit and still win.\" Ibrahim said candidates' main election expenses were advertising, media publicity, organising campaign rallies and meetings, and paying polling agents on election day. \"The law implies that a house of representatives candidate does not need to spend up to N70 million to accomplish all that,\" Ibrahim said. Kamilu Fage, a political science professor at the Bayero University in Kano, northwest Nigeria, agreed. He said it was \"wrong and misleading\" for a house of representatives candidate to claim they must spend N70 million. \"The limit set by the Electoral Act covers all expenses incurred during the campaign and on election day. This may include the amount they spent buying their party nomination form,\" Fage told Africa Check. According to him, N70 million was perhaps \"too much for someone seeking to win a seat in the house of representatives. When you compare it with the official remuneration of a member of the house, you will see that allowing a candidate to spend that much encourages corruption.\" No part of the Electoral Act states that election candidates must have N70 million in ready cash. \"To say a house of representatives candidate needs the N70 million expense limit in cash is absolutely wrong,\" Fage said. \"Either the person is ignorant of the law, which is no excuse, or he is deliberately and intentionally distorting the law and misleading the public. Those who aspire to be leaders should be the first to obey the law.\" He added: \"The reason politicians are revolting against the naira redesign and withdrawal limit is that they need amounts in cash to woo voters and influence electoral officials and security agents. These are not allowed by law.\" Ahmadu Bello University's Ibrahim said Nigerian politicians were also being made uncomfortable by the introduction of the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS). The system verifies the biometrics of voters, such as fingerprints and facial features. \"They are now relying on vote-buying and inducing electoral officials and security agents. They need a lot of cash to do this. That is why a candidate will say he is at a disadvantage because he does not have millions of naira in cash,\" Ibrahim said. Fage said legally allowing candidates to handle large sums in cash risked the violation of the law against money laundering. Nigeria's money laundering law says: \"No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding— N5,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or  N10,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate.\" To buttress his point, Doguwa added that a presidential candidate must, by law, have N1 billion (about $2.2 million) for campaign and election expenses. This claim also falls short. The Electoral Act does not say that a presidential candidate needs any amount of money for an election. It only sets a maximum limit of N5 billion (about $10.9 million, and not N1 billion) for election expenses. It provides for a fine or imprisonment if a candidate knowingly contravenes this provision.

            "[Evidences]:‘Holistic development driving rural India’ is an infographic published by the government on the 48-months portal. The infographic contains claims about sanitation, service centers and optical fiber connectivity. Here is a fact check of these claims. ‘Holistic development driving rural India’ is an infographic published by the government on the 48-months portal. The infographic contains claims about sanitation, service centers and optical fiber connectivity. Here is a fact check of these claims. How many toilets have been built in rural areas? The first claim is that 6.5 crore toilets were built in rural households between the years 1947-2014 and that 7.25 crore toilets have been built between 2014 and 2018. According to the Swachh Bharat Mission dashboard (SBM), there are 15.13 crore households with toilets. It also states that since the launch of the mission, 8.87 crore individual household toilets (IHHL) have been built. This implies that 6.25 crore toilets existed before the launch of the mission (before 2014). Before the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan provided incentives for BPL households to construct IHHLs. The numbers on the SBM dashboard do not match with the data provided in the annual reports of the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation. As per the Ministry’s 2013-14 annual report, ‘Against a cumulative Project objective under Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) & Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) of 12.57 crore IHHL, States have reported on the Online Monitoring System that, sanitation facilities for 9.45 crore individual households has been achieved as on December 2013.’ In other words, the number mentioned in the annual report is far higher than what is available on the SBM dashboard and the claim made by the government. Even as per various answers provided in the Lok Sabha, the UPA government had built more than 5 crore IHHLs between 2008-09 and 2013-14. At the same time, it has to be noted that the CAG report released in 2015 made some interesting observations regarding the NBA. The report said that as per Census 2011 (February 2011), 514.64 lakh rural households had toilet facility within the premises. However, as per records in the government, 768.07 lakh toilets were constructed up to February 2011 in rural households under the TSC/NBA scheme. The report also noted that there were wide variations in certain states. Further, report also highlighted that in 53 districts of eight States where test checks were made, proportion of defunct toilets was found to be more than 33 per cent (24.03 lakh out of total 71.86 lakh households) due to reasons like poor quality of construction, incomplete structure, non-maintenance, etc. It is also important to be note that the Swachh Bharat Mission is a restructuring of the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan. According to a press release of September 2014, ‘Efforts of the State Governments for promoting rural sanitation have been supplemented by the Central Government, till 1999 under the centrally sponsored Rural Sanitation Programme (CRSP), from 1999 to 2012 under the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) and thereafter under the NBA.’ Claim: 6.5 crore toilets were built in rural households between the years 1947-2014. 7.25 crore toilets have been built between 2014-2018. Fact: Since the launch of SBM, 8.87 crore IHHLs were built in rural areas as per the SBM dashboard. However, the claim of 6.25 crore toilets between 1947-2014 is not correct since there is varying data about the same. Hence the claim is MISLEADING. What is the Sanitation coverage? The second claim is that sanitation coverage was 38.70% in 2013-14 it is 83.71% in 2014-18. Sanitation coverage is generally defined in terms of households with toilets. Annual report of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for the year 2017-18 states that, ‘At the launch of SBM(G) on 2nd October, 2014, the sanitation coverage was 38.70%. This has increased to 75.43% as on 31.12.2017. Since launch of SBM(G), there is 36.73% increase in Sanitation Coverage.’ In response to a question in the Lok Sabha, the government stated that ‘Rural sanitation coverage has increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 88.4% as of July 2018’. Claim: Sanitation coverage was 38.70% in 2013-14 it is 83.71% in 2014-18. Fact: Rural sanitation coverage has increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 88.4% as of July 2018. Hence, the claim is TRUE. How many common service centers are there? The third claim is that there were 83,000 Common Service Centers (CSCs) pre 2014 and that this number has increased to 2.92 lakh post 2014. As per the government’s official website, ‘Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme is one of the mission mode projects under the Digital India Programme. CSCs are the access points for delivery of essential public utility services, social welfare schemes, healthcare, financial, education and agriculture services, apart from host of B2C services to citizens in rural and remote areas of the country. It is a pan-India network catering to regional, geographic, linguistic and cultural diversity of the country. Common Services Centres (CSCs) are being managed by CSC e-Governance Services India Limited (known as Common Services Centre Special Purpose Vehicle- CSC –SPV)’ As per the 2013-14 annual report of the CSC e-Governance Services India Limited, there were over 1.35 lakh operational CSCs across the country. In the answer provided in the Lok Sabha, the government stated that 2.53 lakh CSCs were established by October 2016 out of which 1.77 lakh were operational. As per another answer provided in the Rajya Sabha in March 2018, there were 1.83 lakh operational CSCs at the Gram Panchayat Level. In another answer provided in the Rajya Sabha, the government stated that there were 64259 CSCs at the Gram Panchayat level in May 2014 and that the number increased to 1.74 lakh in November 2017. The CSC registration website shows that there are 2.56 lakh active CSC IDs as on date. In other words, the numbers as claimed in the infographic do not match. Even if they were assumed to be operational CSCs in rural areas, the numbers do not match Claim: There were 83,000 common service centers pre 2014. This number has increased to 2.92 lakh post 2014. Fact: There were over 1,35,000 CSCs as per the 2013-14 annual report. The number of active CSC IDs as on date is 2.56 lakh. Hence the claim is FALSE. How many gram panchayats are connected to optical fiber? The final claim is that gram panchayats connected by optical fiber were 59 between 2011 & 2014 and that the number connected between 2014 & 2018 is 1.15 lakh. The Bharat Broad Band Network Limited (BBNL) was incorporated in February 2012 with the aim to carry out the business of establishment, management and operation of National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) and to provide high speed broadband connectivity to all gram panchayats (GPs) by extending optical fiber network and to provide access to bandwidth in a non-discriminatory manner to all eligible service providers. The scheme is not renamed as ‘Bharat Net’. The 2012-13 annual report of BBNL states that 59 gram panchayats of the pilot blocks have been provided with 100 Mbps bandwidth. This pilot project was undertaken under the UPA. The annual reports of the other years do not contain data about yearly progress of connectivity to gram panchayats. However, the Bharat Broadband Network Limited website that has been updated in November 2018 shows that 115,988 gram panchayats are service ready. Claim: Gram panchayats connected by optical fiber were 59 in 2011-14. The number is 1.15 lakh in 2014-18. Fact: 59 gram panchayats of the pilot blocks have been provided with 100 Mbps bandwidth in 2012-13. More than 1.15 lakh gram panchayats are service ready as of November 2018. Hence, the claim is TRUE. But it has to be noted that the numbers during the UPA correspond to the pilot project and not a full-fledged project.

            "[Evidences]:The Russian government continues to tell a different tale about what’s really going on in its war with Ukraine. Even before the invasion began on Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin made false claims that the Ukrainian government was full of Nazis and planned to attack Donetsk and Luhansk, sourtheastern regions of Ukraine known as the Donbas that are controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. On March 9, the Russian government and state-sponsored media shared on Twitter a document allegedly showing \"classified\" Ukrainian military orders to launch an offensive operation in the Donbas. \"Classified documents (order by the Commander National Guard of Ukraine) acquired by @mod_russia confirm without a shadow of a doubt: the Kiev regime was covertly preparing an offensive operation against #Donbass, scheduled for March 2022,\" reads a tweet posted by the Russian Federation’s Ministry of Defense. The post included a Bitly link with \"more details.\" Bitly, a URL shortening service, removed the link from its systems for being \"potentially harmful.\" The document \"has nothing to do with planning an offensive operation,\" the Ukrainian National Guard told StopFake.org, a Ukrainian fact-checking organization. StopFake.org is a verified signatory of the International Fact-checking Network, which promotes nonpartisan and independent fact-checking around the world and is run by PolitiFact’s owner, the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. \"The plan of an offensive operation must provide for the presence of some specific goals that are not in the document,\" the Ukrainian National Guard said. \"This is not an order to march to some position in the (Joint Forces Operation) zone, followed by deployment for an offensive. This is an order for conducting combat coordination in the Lviv region!\" Ukrainian fact-checkers also determined that it isn’t a classified document, because it does not have the corresponding marks. The document represents a typical order for a military training camp for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and National Guard of Ukraine in Starichi, a region in the Lyiv Oblast, according to fact-checkers. That’s in western Ukraine — on the opposite side of the country from the Donbas. While the Donbas region was mentioned in the document, it \"was not either a prominent part of the document nor stated in an offensive context, both of which were alleged in the misleading Russian presentation,\" Christo Grozev, the executive director of Bellingcat, an online investigations organization, told PolitiFact. According to fact-checkers from Science Feedback, another IFCN signatory, the document includes instructions to set up training for battalions to fulfill tasks in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas. There’s no additional information on when, where and what kind of operations, so the document doesn’t prove the claim that \"without a shadow of a doubt\" Ukraine was preparing an attack on the Donbas in March 2022. Russian officials shared a Ukrainian document on Twitter with claims that it showed secret, classified orders for a military offensive on the Donbas region in southeastern Ukraine. This is wrong. There is no proof that the document is classified, and there are no direct statements in it about an attack on the Donbas. The document makes references to a training camp on the opposite side of the country. We rate claims about a document showing a planned military offensive in the Donbas False.\n",

The content has been taken from a website which is unreliable and has been publishing junk stories. A viral post on social media claims that China seeks for court’s approval to kill over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake. Claim A post doing rounds on social media shared by a page named Science Facts reads: “China seek for court’s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus.” The archived version of the post can be checked here. Investigation When Vishvas News investigated we found that the content of the viral post has been taken from a website named City News. When we read the entire content, we found that the report was full of errors (spelling and grammatical). We further investigated and found that the website has been publishing junk news stories earlier as well. This website has also previously spread fake news about the coronavirus. The government of Singapore released a statement refuting the claim. We searched the claim on the website of “The Supreme People’s Court Of The People’s Republic Of China”. there was no mention of the case in this website. World Health Organization (WHO) has been publishing Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Situation Reports. These reports give statistics on the situation of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and other countries. If China was seeking the court’s approval to kill 20,000 people to stop further spread of the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) would have reported it. There is no mention such a report on the website of World Health Organization (WHO). Vishvas News Spoke to Shamim Zakira, Foreign Editor, Global Times, Beijing, China. He said: “This news is circulating online. and it is a hoax and an absolute case of fake news. Though the situation is grim, yet, life is slowing striding to normality. I must say, the government is accelerating all efforts to contain the spread.

The Obama administration then used information that Hillary paid for to justify spying on @realDonaldTrump. If I got that right should be game over. — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 2, 2018 Other Republicans have used the memo to suggest the probe by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III began with tainted fruit, so it is no longer needed. Finally, there needs to be a discussion as to whether the Mueller investigation is truly needed, seeing that the main premise that launched the investigation turned out to not be credible and was both directed and funded by political opponents. #FISAMemo — Rep. Jeff Duncan (@RepJeffDuncan) February 2, 2018 A spokesman for Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) noted the tweet was more fully explained by a statement issued by the congressman: “The entire basis of the investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign and the Russians, along with the corresponding media coverage, was based on false information spread by political and ideological allies to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.” Advertisement The president has even claimed vindication: But the actual memo does not back up these claims — and in fact undermines them. The Facts Much of the GOP memo is about the FBI obtaining a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The memo alleges that the FBI did not fully disclose to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that some of the information stemmed from intelligence reports provided by Christopher Steele, a former British spy under contract for a research firm working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The FBI, in a rare unsigned statement, said it has “grave concerns” about the accuracy of the memo. Here’s the problem with the claim that the memo shows that FBI was spying on the campaign: Carter Page was no longer associated with the campaign when the court order was approved. Advertisement Here’s the timeline. March 16, 2016: In an interview with The Washington Post editorial board, Trump names Page as one of his foreign policy advisers. (In 2013, Page was warned by the FBI that Russian intelligence operatives were trying to recruit him.) “Well, I hadn’t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names … Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counterterrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that’s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that’s a representative group.” July 7-8, 2016: Page attracts attention by traveling to Moscow and delivering a speech harshly critical of U.S. policy toward Russia. He emails campaign officials about “incredible insights” from his trip. Aug. 5, 2016: The Trump campaign begins to back away from Page when The Washington Post reports on the unease in both parties caused by Page’s remarks in Russia. Asked to comment on Page’s public statements and campaign role, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Page was an “informal foreign policy adviser” who “does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.” Advertisement Sept. 23, 2016: The Trump campaign denies Page was ever part of the campaign. “Mr. Page is not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign,” campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said. “He’s never been part of our campaign. Period.” The statement comes as Yahoo News reports that a U.S. intelligence probe was trying to determine if Page had “opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president.” Sept. 26, 2016: Page himself announces he is taking “a leave of absence” from the campaign, saying the reporting on his remarks has created a “distraction.” Oct. 21, 2016: Nearly a month after the Trump campaign says Page was never part of the campaign, the FBI seeks and receives a FISA court order to begin surveillance on Page. The order is renewed at least three more times over the next year, meaning that the FBI is able to convince the judges that surveillance continues to provide assistance to investigators. The Wall Street Journal reported that all of the judges who approved the orders were appointed by Republicans. Advertisement Feb. 16, 2017: Trump denies he ever met Page. “I don’t think I’ve ever met him,” he told reporters at a news conference. “And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him, ever.” In other words, the surveillance began long after Page had supposedly left the campaign. Trump denies he ever met or spoke to Page. So it’s hard to see how a court order on a former campaign adviser — less than three weeks before the election — would constitute spying on the campaign. The memo also discloses that the FBI opened a counterintelligence operation in July because of allegations concerning other Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos. But Papadopoulos was never mentioned in the Steele dossier. He came to attention of the FBI because he had told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had obtained thousands of Clinton’s emails. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the special counsel. Advertisement A spokesman for Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho) did not respond to a request for comment. Update: After this article was published, Todd Winer, a Labrador spokesman, provided the following comment: “The Nunes Memo makes it clear that federal officials were interested in Carter Page because he was connected to the Trump campaign. Why else would the FISA application contain the findings of the anti-Trump dossier? Why else would the application include the fact that the FBI was already investigating Trump advisor George Papadopoulos? Whether or not Carter Page was on the payroll of the Trump campaign on the date of the FISA order is irrelevant. By virtue of the fact that he had once worked on the campaign, he was connected to the campaign. “For a year, the Washington Post and other media outlets have specifically mentioned Carter Page as one of the leading figures in the Trump-Russia collusion story. Now that the media narrative is falling apart, all of a sudden you want to argue that Carter Page has nothing to do with Trump. You can’t have it both ways.” A spokesman for Duncan said: “Had the noncredible DNC funded dossier never been leaked to the media to fuel mass speculation of Russian involvement, and had it not been used as ‘evidence’ to elevate the investigation to the level of requesting FISA warrants, it’s very likely that there would have never been a perceived need for special counsel to be created in the first place.” Duncan’s spokesman appears to be referring to the Yahoo News article. That article included a claim that later surfaced in the Steele dossier — and which has been vehemently denied by Page: that Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft. Steele has admitted in court documents that he met with Yahoo News at the behest of Fusion GPS, the firm that hired him. Advertisement But the special counsel was appointed after Trump fired James B. Comey as FBI director. Moreover, the impetus for the investigation was not Page, but Papadopoulos. The tip with the Australian government stirred attention because it coincided with the leak of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee by Russian hackers. Page was interviewed at length by the FBI in March, according to news reports, but that is before Mueller was named special counsel. As far as can be determined, Page is not a major figure in the Mueller probe. Mueller, meanwhile, has indicted Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, and obtained a guilty plea from Michael Flynn, who served briefly as Trump’s national security adviser. The White House did not respond to a request for an explanation of how the memo vindicated the president. The Pinocchio Test The GOP memo provides no evidence that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign. Instead, it shows that the court order for surveillance of Page was obtained weeks after Page and the Trump campaign had said Page was no longer part of the campaign. Trump has asserted that he never even met or spoke to Page. Advertisement Moreover, the GOP memo confirms that the separate investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign was prompted by information that was not contained in the Steele dossier. One wonders if Republicans making claims of FBI spying on the Trump campaign have even read the memo. Such statements earn Four Pinocchios.

            "[Evidences]: Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we’ve learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Since as early as October 2019, Snopes readers have inquired about headlines and social media posts that claim burning sage “kills 94% of bacteria.” In 2020, the question took on new significance for some readers as the United States grappled with a surge of reported cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Though burning some plants has been scientifically shown to eliminate airborne bacterium, there is inconclusive evidence to suggest that burning sage – or “smudging” – is capable of purifying the air in confined spaces. The “94%” claim is based on a 2007 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in which researchers analyzed the ability of “medicinal smoke” to cleanse a room of certain airborne bacteria. Reports have since circulated the internet, incorrectly lumping sage into a long ingredient list that included dried roots and leaves tested as part of the experiment. “This is highly controversial since breathing in smoke has known harms, yet the antibacterial benefits are uncertain,” Dean of Yale School of Public Health Dr. Sten Vermund told Snopes. Vermund added that there is no evidence that burning sage kills either bacteria or viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the severe respiratory disease COVID-19. As part of the 2007 study, researchers from the National Botanical Research Institute in India burned medicinal smoke from havan samagri within a confined space to determine whether certain herbs contained antimicrobial properties. Havan samagri is a “mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs” that contains dozens of various types of wood, herbs, fruit and seeds used in Vedic Hindu tradition. However, sage was not included in the study’s ingredient list. One hour of burning havan samagri was shown to kill more than 94% of airborne bacteria – and the effects were not short-lived. The evidence further suggested that medicinal smoke had the ability to “purify” or “disinfect” the air for up to 24 hours in a closed room. Even after a month, the researchers found that certain pathogenic bacteria were still absent from the room, such as those that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Though it appears havan samagri may have some antimicrobial properties when burned, the findings do not suggest its use has any impact on viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This is, in part, due to the biological differences between bacteria and viruses. The Mayo Clinic notes that bacteria are capable of thriving in “many different types of environments” whereas viruses require living hosts to multiply. The way that COVID-19 spreads and how long it is present in the air also plays a role. The virus is known to transmit via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and land in the mouth or nose of someone nearby. Evidence also suggests that the virus spreads when an individual touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose, though recently published guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) caution that “this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” It is not known how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces and research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggests the virus may last at least several hours and up to three days on certain surfaces. Different surfaces and different conditions – such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and air movements – may see different results. Higher humidity, higher temperature, more airflow, and more sunlight or UV light are less-than-ideal conditions for SARS-CoV-2. “This is subject of uncertainty and will differ for indoor and outdoor spaces. Certain ‘super-spreader’ events have suggested that individuals in the wrong place (i.e. poorly ventilated indoor spaces) at the wrong time may mean considerable risk. But as a rule of thumb, aerosols can disperse across an indoor space,” explained Vermund. The CDC recommends using a combination of soap, water, and surface disinfectants identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sanitize spaces for the COVID-19 virus. Vermund added that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operations can also be adjusted or increased to spur great air circulation. “In the absence of an HVAC system in a building, strategic and well-planned outward-facing fans can be placed in windows to create a negative pressure area (as one sees in some kitchens and attics) that can decrease levels of virus in the air,” said Vermund. “Of course, mask use, physical distancing, hand/face/surface hygiene, outdoor activities, small crowds, and testing and contact tracing are all vital.” Though sage is not known to eliminate airborne bacteria or viruses, the herb has been shown to contain antiseptic properties that are beneficial to human health. Previous research has found that sage mouthwash effectively reduced the number of mouth bacteria and may work as an effective treatment for certain mental health conditions, diabetes, and cancer. Further studies have shown that sage includes anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, among other health benefits. Smudging is an ancient ritual that holds both cultural and practical significance whereby a person burns certain plants in an effort to cleanse space. In early Indian writing dating between the 6th and 8th centuries BCE, it was believed that fumigating an operating room by burning mustard, butter, and salt was an early form of “antisepsis,” yet it was also practiced to keep evil spirits away, according to a 2018 study published in the Indian Journal of Otology. Similarly, a 2020 study published in the journal Tel Aviv described the chemical residue of marijuana and frankincense discovered at a 2,000-year-old limestone altar in modern Israel. It was thought that both were burned as a way to administer their therapeutic benefits when ceremonial participants inhaled smoke.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Thursday morning was a rough one for Bob Tiernan. Just before Democrat John Kitzhaber accepted the governorship, the chairman of Oregon’s Republican Party had to bat away suggestions that the state GOP was in need of a major makeover.Tiernan was a guest on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud Thursday morning, and host Emily Harris asked him what was next for the party. \"If Chris Dudley had won, there was a lot of talk that he would be the leader of rebuilding the Oregon Republican Party,\" she said. She then went on to mention the fact that all statewide offices belong to Democrats and that Republicans had been having a difficult time finding candidates for some races.How, Harris asked, would Dudley’s loss affect all that?\"First off, the Republican Party is quite strong in this state. I think you can look at our statistics from this last election,\" Tiernan said. \"We outperformed Democrats. ... Six percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats.\"We wondered whether he had that right.If you take the statement at face value, it sounds as though you had more Republicans than Democrats voting.Thankfully, the Oregon Secretary of State tracks all these numbers.As of 8:30 Thursday morning, the Secretary of State was reporting that roughly 644,000 Democrats and 526,000 Republicans voted out of a total of 1,479,188 for all ballots returned. That means Democrats accounted for about 44 percent of returned ballots and Republicans for about 36 percent. That gives the edge to Democrats.But there’s another way to look at these numbers. While more Democrats than Republicans voted, there are far more Oregon voters registered as Democrats than as Republicans. If you take that into account, the numbers show that 79 percent of all Republicans had turned out to vote while 74.5 of all Democrats had. That is indeed a difference of 6 percent.We spoke with Greg Leo, the spokesman for the Oregon Republican Party, and he told us that Tiernan was referring to the return rates within each party, not overall.So, back to the ruling. Tiernan is right, the Republicans did have a stronger turnout if you’re talking party proportions. But he didn’t make it exactly clear what he meant in his guest spot on \"Think Out Loud,\" and certainly listeners could have come away a bit confused, thinking more Republicans had voted than Democrats. So, we’ll split the difference and call this one Half True. Comment on this item.\n",

It represents the single largest investment in school safety in American history.” — Vice President Pence, in remarks in Indianapolis, May 18, 2018 “I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security and mental health.” — President Trump, in remarks to the National Rifle Association, Dallas, Texas, May 4 This fact check has been updated We first spotted Vice President Pence’s claim of “nearly $2 billion” in funding for school safety but then realized that President Trump had offered a more grandiose statement of “more than $2 billion” during his speech to the NRA. Advertisement With yet another deadly school shooting, this time in Santa Fe, Tex., it seems appropriate to figure whether these numbers are real. Pence touted it as the “single largest investment to school safety in American history” and attributed it “to the president’s leadership.” The Facts The funding is contained in the omnibus spending package signed into law in March — a bill that the president said he was “unhappy” with. He threatened a veto and then signed it anyway, but promised he would “never sign another bill like this again.” The vice president’s office directed us to the White House Office and Management and Budget for a detailed explanation of “nearly $2 billion” in funding. An OMB senior adviser provided a list of programs that added up to $1.7 billion, which means that according to the White House’s own accounting the president was exaggerating when he said “more than $2 billion.” Advertisement But upon inspection, the vice president is exaggerating too. The biggest part of the figure — $1.1 billion — is for a school grants program that is only tenuously connected to school safety. The program, Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE), is a block grant, also known as Title IV-A, signed into law by President Barack Obama, with an authorized level of $1.6 billion a year. At least 20 percent of the funds are supposed to be used for “safe and healthy students,” which ranges from school-based mental health programs and suicide prevention to better health and safety practices in athletic programs. This is what is supposed to represent “school safety” and “security at schools.” At best the administration could claim $220 million of the $1.1 billion appropriation for school security, but frankly that’s a stretch. Advertisement Under the law, the grants are also supposed to be used for “well-rounded educational opportunities” — such as bolstering STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education — and “effective use of technology” in increasing academic achievement. No more than 15 percent of the money can be spent on buying “technology infrastructure.” Indeed, language in the House Appropriations Committee report and the omnibus explanatory statement published in the Congressional Record shows that Congress expected that much of this money would be spent on STEM education, especially computer science training for “underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line.” That doesn’t sound like school security at all. The OMB official defended attributing all the money to school security because the Education Department estimates two-thirds “of the districts will receive under $30,000, meaning they will have no restrictions on how they can allocate funds.” He added: “The program was designed to be very flexible with the intention of meeting local needs. Since we do not know if districts intend to seek waivers, we have stated that ‘up to $1.1 billion is available for school safety needs.’” Advertisement Kirsten Stewart, director of public policy at advocacy group Futures without Violence, a member of the Title IV-A Coalition, says other estimates indicate a “a good percentage” of school districts will exceed the $30,000 threshold, requiring guidelines to be followed. She said it is not clear how the money has been spent in the past. There’s another fishy aspect to Pence and Trump bragging about the SSAE grants. The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted the program should be eliminated, even just weeks before the passage of the omnibus legislation in its 2019 budget proposal. In 2018, SSAE received funding of almost $400 million, but Trump proposed to zero it out, arguing “it duplicates activities that may be supported by other Federal programs as well as state, local, and private funding.” Congress simply ignored the administration’s objections and even boosted the annual funding by $700 million. Advertisement A tip-off that the administration was not happy about this development is that in its official Statement of Administration Policy on the omnibus bill, issued March 22, the OMB made no mention of the SSAE grants when it applauded money in the bill to improve school safety. Instead, it mentioned the inclusion of the STOP School Violence Act, which earned a $75 million appropriation in 2019, and a few other programs in the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Justice. (The $75 million for the STOP School Violence Act came from funds already appropriated for the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, a program developed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, that the Trump administration also sought to end funding for in 2019.) Note that Pence claimed the funding was “thanks to the president’s leadership.” That’s akin to a student on a group project in high school who repeatedly badmouths the group’s agenda, even to the point of refusing to do any work — and then tries to claim credit after the project earned kudos from the teacher. Advertisement The other items on the OMB list are a grab-bag of items totaling about $500 million, such as $71 million for Project AWARE, to increase awareness of mental health issues among youth, $94 million for peer-to-peer mentoring of at-risk youths and $24 million to prevent gang violence. There’s also $90 million for “school safety national activities,” but that’s mostly aimed at training teachers on how to improve violent behavior by students. That’s also higher than the administration requested; for 2019, the administration wants to cut the funding to $42 million and turn the focus on the opioid crisis. We would argue that some of these programs have little to do with school security, especially in the context of school shootings. But in any case, even under the most generous accounting, it doesn’t come close to $2 billion. Advertisement The OMB did not respond to repeated questions about how it determined this was the largest investment in school safety in U.S. history. Given how the other numbers were fudged, this is also rather dubious. The Pinocchio Test On either side of $2 billion, Pence and Trump have been rather misleading with the funding for school security in the omnibus bill. More than 60 percent of the money comes from a pot that is mostly devoted to a well-rounded education or technology, not school safety — and it’s an Obama-era program the administration wanted to zero out. The administration’s spin earns Four Pinocchios. Update, May 24: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a CNN Town Hall on May 23 made a similar statement: “In our omnibus bill that we passed a — just a few weeks ago, we had $1.8 billion — I think it was $1.8 billion, it could be $1.6 billion in there for this purpose, for schools to make — to give them an opportunity to secure them.” Advertisement A Pelosi spokesman initially defended her comment by referring to a news release issued by the Republican staff of the House Appropriations Committee. This news release actually claimed $2.3 billion for school safety, largely because of two bone-headed math errors. (For instance ,the release added the $1.1 billion for SSAE grants and the $90 million for “school safety national activities” and came up with a total of $1.9 billion in education funding.) The spokesman then said she agreed with “the smaller number if you are only counting the funds in a very limited definition of safety.” Pelosi at least indicated schools had an option here, so her comment is worth Three Pinocchios.

            "[Evidences]:The video was shared by Pakistani opposition lawmaker Azam Khan Swati to his 160,000 Twitter followers on January 11. The clip shows Modi boasting that India has \"beaten out all of Pakistan's false bravado\". \"I've forced them to carry a bowl and go around the world [to beg],\" he says in Hindi. Swati, a member of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, claimed the footage showed Modi mocking the shaky alliance that came to power after PTI leader Imran Khan was ousted as prime minister. He tweeted in Urdu: \"To those who facilitated the regime change. Can you hear what India's Modi is saying about Pakistan? If there is no honour in you then at least have some shame? \"People of Pakistan: this is why the only way to save this country is through Imran Khan's trufe freedom.\" Pakistan has been gripped by political turmoil since Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April. The former leader insists he was overthrown by a US-led \"regime change\" conspiracy -- which Washington strongly denies -- and has rallied mass demonstrations pressing the government to call a snap election. He vowed to fight on with his \"last drop of blood\" after he was shot in an assassination attempt at a rally in November. Pro-PTI Facebook pages shared the video of Modi speaking here and here and it also circulated on Twitter here, here and here. A reverse image search of keyframes from the clip found it in a longer video posted on YouTube on April 21, 2019 by Indian newspaper The Economic Times. The clip in the misleading posts corresponds to the 02:09 mark of The Economic Times' video. India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also shared a video of Modi's full speech on YouTube on the same day, where he can be heard making the same comments at the 34:32 mark. In the full speech, which Modi gave in Rajasthan while campaigning for reelection in 2019, he boasted that his government had called Pakistan's \"nuclear bluff\". At the time, tensions surged between the nuclear-armed rivals after India said it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistan's territory. \"India has stopped getting scared of Pakistan's threats. Every other day they say, 'we have a nuclear button.' What do we have then? Have we kept it for Diwali?\" Modi said, referring to a Hindu festival when fireworks are set off. He added: \"Brothers and sisters, we've beaten out all of Pakistan's false bravado. I've forced them to carry a bowl and go around the world [to beg].\" AFP has debunked a wave of misinformation surrounding Imran Khan's ouster, including here, here and here.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Following a drawn-out re-election in 2017 Uhuru Kenyatta is keen on refocusing the national agenda on development. His national address looked forward to securing his legacy as he serves out his final term. But do the claims about what his administration achieved in its first term hold up to close scrutiny? Here's what we found. Devolution Claim \"From an allocation of KSh210 billion in the FY 2013/2014, we now stand at KSh327 billion for the FY 2017/2018, an increase of 56% in five years.\" Verdict downplayed In 2010, a new constitution provided for the creation of 47 county governments. The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. This amount is calculated using \"the most recent audited accounts of revenue received, as approved by the National Assembly\". Kenyatta said his government was \"today far above\" the constitutional threshold, adding that the allocations had in the five years since 2013, when the counties started operations, grown by 56%. In the 2013/2014 financial year, the government allocated KSh210 billion to the counties in total according to the 2013 Division of Revenue Act . That was the total allocation including the equitable share, which was KSh190 billion and 28% of the 2011/2012 revenues, which had been audited by parliament but not yet approved by the time the law was passed. For the financial year 2017/2018, the 2017 Division of Revenue Act shows the national government allocated KSh302 billion in equitable share and KSh345.68 billion in total to the counties, not KSh327 billion as stated by the president. The figure was thus understated by KSh18.69 billion and is actually a 65% rise in the five years. - Vincent Ng'ethe Economy Claim \"Our real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.9 percent in 2017.\" Verdict correct Kenyatta said that despite the challenges posed by a prolonged 2017 election and drought, the Kenyan economy \"remained resilient\". According to the 2018 Economic Survey recently released by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , Kenya's gross domestic product at market prices is estimated to have grown 4.9% in 2017. Kenya's GDP growth under President Kenyatta Year GDP growth 2013 5.7% 2014 5.3% 2015 5.6% 2016 5.9% 2017 4.9% Source: Various surveys by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics While it is the first time economic growth has fallen below 5% under Kenyatta, the 2017 slowdown is actually a good news story \"given the disruptions we have had\", development economist Anzetse Were told Africa Check. In an earlier review of this figure, Were said that \"previous analysis indicates that the economy tends to slow down in an election year by about 1.2%-1.4%\". The use of \"real GDP\" as opposed to market price GDP does not change the figures as inflation is usually considered when calculating economic growth from year to year. This Kwame Owino, the chief executive officer of Nairobi-based economic think-tank Institute of Economic Affairs , told Africa Check. - Vincent Ng'ethe Health Claim \"Maternal mortality fell from 488 deaths per 100,000 lives to 362 deaths per 100,000.\" Verdict correct A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth or within 6 weeks after birth, but not from accidental or incidental (such as self-harm) causes. When given as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in a specified period it is referred to as a maternal mortality ratio. The United Nations views a ratio of fewer than 100 deaths per 100,000 live births as low. Once the ratio crosses the 300 barrier, it is considered high and above 500 very high. The president's figure of 488 deaths per 100,000 births was from the 2008-09 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Dr Elizabeth Kimani-Murage, the head of the maternal and child wellbeing unit at the African Population and Health Research Center , told Africa Check. This survey covered the 10 years before and is what would have been available to Kenyatta's government when it took office in 2013. In November 2015, the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey was published and remains the most recent. This survey estimated that Kenya's maternal mortality ratio was 362 deaths per 100,000 live births. Survey data was not available to the UN But the UN estimated this figure at 510 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015. This is because data from the DHS 2014 had not been available to the UN when it published its modelled estimates, Dr Doris Chou, a medical officer at the World Health Organisation's department of reproductive health and research, told Africa Check. The \"confidence intervals\" of the two estimates - the UN and the DHS - overlap meaning it was highly likely that there was no statistical difference between them. \"When we update our estimates, the 2014 DHS information will be included, and its inclusion will likely make the differences observed between the internationally comparable UN estimates and the DHS smaller; because more country-specific data is being used to help shape the estimates,\" Chou said. - Lee Mwiti Claim \"The NHIF coverage widened from a membership of 3.8 million in 2013 to 7.2 million currently.\" Verdict mostly-correct This claim is one of the president's \"Big Four\" agenda for the next five years. Its aim is to have every Kenyan covered by medical insurance by the end of his current and final term. The national statistics office in 2013/14 put the membership of the National Health Insurance Fund at 3.8 million . During his inauguration in November 2017, Kenyatta put the number of Kenyans covered by the National Health Insurance Fund as 6.8 million \"beneficiaries\". The Economic Survey 2018 released by the national statistics office also has the same number for 2016/7. Kenyatta said his administration intended to raise the number of beneficiaries to 13 million \"Kenyans and their dependents\" within five years. Kenyatta was referring to principal members when he talked of \"beneficiaries\", the public insurer told Africa Check in January 2018. It further provided information showing it had 7,058,603 contributing members at the end of December 2017. (Note: However, only half of this number - or 3,500,478 - were active members, meaning that only they and their dependents could be treated at approved hospitals immediately. Members in arrears must first update their account if they are to be treated, and this can take up to 30 days, meaning the president's claim needs more context.) - Lee Mwiti Claim \"We have increased health facilities from 9,000 in 2013 to 11,000 in 2017.\" Verdict incorrect According to the health ministry's national staffing plan for 2014-2018 , there were 7,795 health facilities in 2013 . These ranged from dispensaries to national hospitals. Of these, 3,956 were government-owned, 881 faith-based, 306 run by not-for-profits and 2,652 were privately owned. According to the ministry's Kenya Master Health Facility List , as at 3 May 2018, there were 10,111 health facilities in Kenya, all of which are operational . A January 2018 national treasury report notes an increase in the number of health facilities \"from just about 9,000 before devolution to 10,000\". - Vincent Ng'ethe Tourism Claim \"Tourism earnings grew 20% in 2017.\" Verdict correct Kenyatta said that despite what had been a protracted election year, receipts from tourism had actually grown. In 2017, Kenya earned KSh119.9 billion from tourism according to the 2018 Economic Survey. This, the national statistics office said, was a 20.3% increase from 2016, when earnings were KSh99.7 billion. The data agency attributed this to an 8% rise in the number of international visitors from 1.34 million in 2016 to 1.45 million in 2017. - Vincent Ng'ethe Roads Claim \"When I assumed office as President, we promised to tarmac 10,000 kms roads across the country; we are on target having completed 3,000 kms to-date and with a further 5,000 kms under construction.\" Verdict unproven Kenya has a total road network of 161,451 km, according to the 2017/2018 annual public roads programm e published by the Kenya Roads Board . It does not, however, break this down by type. The country had 11,200 km of bitumen road in 2013 when Kenyatta took office. This is according to the Economic Survey 2018. The new administration pledged to increase this to 24,000 km of paved road in the next five years, or by 12,800 km. Evaluating this claim is further compounded by the variation in official data. In 2017, the national statistics office said that bitumen roads had increased to 20,600 km, or by 9,400 km. In 2016, the agency had the tarmac road network at 14,500 km, meaning 6,100 km of road was added in just one year. (Note: In the same year the statistics office also has a figure of 11,796 km of tarmac road.) But a January 2018 report by the national treasury showed that between the financial years of 2013/2014 and 2016/2017, some 1,919 km of bitumen road were built. Our year-long efforts to get data from the government on the status of the road network have so far turned up empty. We will keep trying, however. Electricity Claim \"You might also recall the expansion of Last-Mile Connectivity, which has brought electricity to 71% of households, up from 27% in 2013.\" Verdict incorrect According to Kenya Power, the country's electricity utility, \"last mile\" refers to the last link to the consumers' premise or home. The Last-Mile Connectivity project was rolled out in 2015 and seeks to increase electricity access, especially in rural and peri-urban areas, by subsidising connection costs. It is funded by government and a clutch of donors. As at June 2017, some 49,813 new customers had been connected under it. According to Kenya Power, there were 1.69 million domestic customers at the end of its 2012/2013 financial year. (Note: A breakdown of how electricity consumers are categorised can be found here .) The 2012 /2013 Kenya National Housing Survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics estimated that Kenya had 9.2 million households in 2013, meaning 18.4% - not 27% - were connected. As at May 2018, Kenya Power had 6.67 million domestic consumers, 2.4 million of who were postpaid and 4.3 million prepaid, according to company spokesman Johnstone Ole Turana. Each household should have its own meter, he added, and in an apartment, each house also has its meter. Kenya had 11.4 million households in 2016, according to the Basic Report on Well-being in Kenya released in March 2018 by the national statistics office. Using this data, the number of connected households works out to 58.4% and not 71%. The country's next census is set for 2019. - Lee Mwiti & Vincent Ng'ethe Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/fact-checked-kenyattas-2017-state-nation-address/\n",

The fake screenshot and the original news story bear the same timestamp of 4.56 pm NDTV Story On COVID-19 Patients Appearing For Exams The NDTV story does not relate to the COMEDK exams but is about how students who were already COVID-19 positive were allowed to appear for the CET exam for engineering, while following social distancing norms. The story which is being used in a misleading context states that of the 1.47 lakh students who appeared for CET, 60 were COVID-19 positive.

            "[Evidences]:A viral image doesn’t mention COVID-19, but it falsely implies that vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The image states: \"79.4% of babies who die of ‘SIDS’ had a vaccine the same day.\" The claim, shared in an Oct. 26 Instagram post, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that vaccines cause babies to die from SIDS — the sudden, unexpected death of an apparently healthy baby younger than 1 year, usually during sleep. The cause of SIDS is unknown. But it appears SIDS might be associated with defects in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep, though other factors such as low birth weight and sleeping on the stomach or side, can also make an infant more vulnerable, according to Mayo Clinic. The statistic cited in the image could be incorrectly quoting a finding from a 2015 study done by researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that examined deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. VAERS is run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. For reports in the database of the deaths of children up to age 17, 79.4% received more than one vaccine on the same day; and among infants, 86.2% received more than one vaccine on the same day. So, the study said the vast majority of infant deaths occurred among infants who received more than one vaccination on the same day. But receiving more than one vaccine on the same day is common for infants. And the study did not say that the infants died on the same day as the vaccination. Moreover, the study said: \"Because SIDS peaks at a time when children are receiving many recommended vaccinations, it would not be unexpected to observe a coincidental close temporal relationship between vaccination and SIDS.\" The CDC says currently: \"Babies receive multiple vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This age range is also the peak age for SIDS. The timing of the 2-month and 4-month shots and SIDS has led some people to question whether they might be related. However, studies have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS.\" We rated False a claim made in June that SIDS \"is absolutely a side effect of vaccination.\" We cited the lack of any evidence that vaccines cause SIDS, and noted that studies actually show that receiving recommended immunizations can lower an infant’s risk of SIDS. We rate the viral image False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the state’s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a \"bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent.\" He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the state’s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. \"If your family needed a quick infusion of cash,\" Patterson wrote, \"would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?\"We’re not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency’s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting \"externally managed direct real estate investments\" and nearly $1.2 billion \"attributable to short-term investments\" in the state’s treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so it’s on call for the agency’s real estate investments.The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross \"time-weighted\" returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.\"Time-weighted\" returns?By email, Suydam told us the term describes a \"complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured\" which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.We checked on the rainy day fund’s earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the state’s treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agency’s cash-on-call funds.\"I don’t count the cash,\" Patterson replied, \"because it’s not part of our investment portfolio.\"The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agency’s portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the fund’s remaining $25.6 billion.Our rulingPatterson’s reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agency’s real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioner’s March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.We rate the statement as Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:South African President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his second state of the nation address in parliament on 7 February. It was also the fifth - and final - Sona address of the current administration before this year's national elections in May. But did the president get his facts right as he listed the government's achievements? Africa Check partnered with 24-hour news channel eNCA to fact-check his claims on the night. The economy Claim \"In 2017, we recorded an inflow of foreign direct investment amounting to R17 billion.\" Verdict correct Foreign direct investments are made by companies or individuals from one country into businesses in another country. Data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development shows that US$1.325 billion of foreign money was invested in South Africa in 2017. This is about R17.3 billion at the 30 June 2017 exchange rate. It's a however a decrease from US$2.235 billion - or R29.2 billion - in 2016. The figures sounded \"about right\", said Prof Jannie Rossouw, head of the school of economic and business sciences at Wits University . But \"it's nothing in the bigger scheme of things... it's less than a percentage [point] of our economy\". -Cayley Clifford READ: Misleading to say South Africa's GDP has grown 'three fold' since 1994 Claim \"The World Bank's annual Doing Business Report currently puts South Africa number 82 out of 190 countries that they have tracked with regard to being able to do business in an efficient way.\" Verdict correct The World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" index rates countries on a scale of 0 (absolute poor ease of doing business) to 100 (absolute better ease of doing business). The score is calculated from indicators such as how long it takes to open a business or transfer a property and how easy it is to access credit. South Africa was ranked 82nd with a score of 66.03 in 2018. New Zealand was ranked first, with a score of 86.59. The report says high-ranking countries \"are those that have consistently well designed business regulation or whose regulatory environments have thrived thanks to comprehensive reform over the years\". Somalia placed last at 190th, with a score of 20.04. - Lloyd Hazvineyi Infrastructure Claim \"Over the past five years, we've made significant progress with the provision of infrastructure.

Only 6,939 'work experiences' committed so far The initiative is a partnership between the government, business, labour and civil society.

Social grants Claim \"Every month 17.5 million social grants are provided to South Africans.\" Verdict correct The South African Social Security Agency administers social grants. Its most recent data on grants is from December 2018, when 17,731,402 social grants were paid. The lowest number of grants delivered in 2018 was 17,396,831 in January. The average for the 2017/18 financial year ending in March 2018 was 17,509,555 grants. The number has however grown steadily - in 2007/08 the average was 12,423,739.

In last year's State of the Nation address, he put the number at \" nearly one million children \". This year, his figure is \"over 700,000\". Both are way below the actual numbers. Martin Gustafsson, an economics researcher at the University of Stellenbosch , says there are \" widespread misperceptions around how many children in South Africa attend some form of ECD institution\". He has researched and written extensively on the economics of education and pre-school participation. 'How seriously South Africa takes education' Using data from Statistics South Africa, Gustafsson estimates that 2,409,953 children were in some kind of pre-school in 2016. ( Note: These were children who were younger than eight at the start of 2016. ) The 2017 general household survey reported that just over 2 million children under the age of four were attending a \"day care centre, crèche, early childhood development centre (ECD) playgroup, nursery school or preprimary school\". Knowing how many children are in these facilities is important for the government's policy planning. Gustafsson adds that the existing underestimates may send the wrong signal to international investors about \"how seriously South Africa takes the education of its citizens\". - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"Over the past five years… [we've built] two new universities.\" Verdict correct In 2014, Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley, Northern Cape, and the University of Mpumalanga in Nelspruit opened their doors to students. According to the public infrastructure update in the 2018 Budget Review, construction at these institutions is ongoing . \" New facilities include lecture rooms, laboratories, sport and recreation amenities and student accommodation.\" - Liesl Pretorius Claim \"We launched the Safe initiative in August last year...\" Verdict correct The Sanitation Appropriate For Education ( Safe) initiative was launched on 14 August 2018. Partners in the project include the department of basic education , National Education Collaboration Trust and Nelson Mandela Foundation . Its main objective is to replace unsafe school toilet facilities - like pit latrines - with safe ones. A national government audit of schools in May and June 2018 found that at 3,898 schools the only toilets available were pit latrines. Another 3,040 had \"proper sanitation\", but pit toilets were still on the premises. - Lloyd Hazvineyi READ: Have 'hundreds' of kids drowned in school pit latrines in South Africa? Claim \"... Since we launched the initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects and a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages.\" Verdict unproven The president's figures were from December 2018, the department of basic education told Africa Check. Since then 88 more schools have been completed, bringing the total to 787, spokesperson Troy Martens told Africa Check. Companies that pledged to support the plan have also been meeting their obligations, Martens added. But it was difficult to independently verify the department's numbers, two education-focused civil society organisations told Africa Check. - Lloyd Hazvineyi Tourism Claim \"In the past year we had 10 million tourists who came to our country, which is a huge increase .\" Verdict unproven Statistics South Africa defines a tourist as \"an overnight visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation in the place visited\". In 2017 South Africa had 10,825,197 tourists, according to the agency. It had 10,044,163 tourists in 2016 and 8,903,773 in 2015. Full data for 2018 is not yet available but, from January to November 2018 there were 9,464,950 tourist arrivals, according to Stats SA's tourism and migration report released in January 2019. It seems likely that the figure will increase to 10 million tourists. But in the absence of data for the full year we rate the claim unproven.

            "[Evidences]:Did a city treasurer named Rodolfo Guerrero Duran of Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico cut the budget for the food of the local police dogs and did this lead to two of them getting very sick and almost starving? Yes, the story is real and it did happen but it was in 2016 and the dogs already recovered. Despite this several sites keep recycling the story to get some easy symphathy clicks in order to make money through advertising. The story recently reappeared in an article published by a site named gruaja.net on August 11, 2018 titled \"City Treasurer Starved K-9 Police Dogs Because Feeding Them Would Cost Too Much | Animals\" (archived here) which opened: A city treasurer from Mexico was reportedly starving their K-9 police dogs because he claimed that their food was too expensive. Mexican news site El-Mexicano and HOY Estado de Mexico published an article claiming Municipal Treasurer Rodolfo Guerrero Duran of Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico; is responsible for the poor condition of their municipality's K-9 dogs. According to us.blastingnews.com and wereblog.com, the treasurer decided to cut the budget for the food maintenance of these service dogs as he claimed that the municipality cannot afford to spend money on them. On social media the story looks terrible, with an image of a starving dog to attract attention: It also mentions a petition hosted at DailyPetion but gives no link to it. That makes sense: the original 2017 article at Wereblog on which the story is based does have the link (https://www.dailypetition.com/Punish-city-treasurer-who-left-all-police-dogs-to-starve-because-feeding-them-would-cost-too-much-t-937) but it expired long ago. It did have the text of the original petition however: It is our firm belief that cutting funds for the K-9 units is completely unacceptable and a total disgrace. We, the undersigned, urge the authorities to re-evaluate this measure and start feeding the dogs as soon as possible, in addition to relieving Mr. Duran from office. We stand firm that such people should not be in the service of the community in any circumstances. The canines have done nothing but a wonderful job protecting the local administration and the people of Silao, keeping everyone safe and out of harm's way. I reckon they deserve a little more respect than this! Please take urgent action for the dogs from Silao. They need our help more than ever. It is imperative they receive proper food before they do not collapse and die! Digging a little deeper reveals an English language article from 2016 (with Spanish-language source here) that explains what was going on: Silao investigates abuse of K9 police dogs The two police dogs of Canino Tactical Group K-9 municipality of Silao recover after they were on the verge of death from malnutrition. Maria Guadalupe Espinoza Corral, councilor of the Partido Verde Political Party in Silao, reported that dogs are already better. And: The official demanded that the city conduct a thorough investigation of the case, noting that the dogs health was affected because their food was changed. Corral Espinoza said the treasurer Rodolfo Guerrero Duran cut the budget for feeding the dogs, who stopped being fed croquettes Diamond premium brand. The councilor said she requested the food of the sick dogs, who were taken to a veterinary clinic in Leon to be changed. In other words, the dogs are fine, no need to go sign petitions or share the story to all your friends.

            "claim [Claim]: \"I am roughly being paid $53 a day to educate your child.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:For the hottest debate in North Carolina politics, look no further than teacher pay. Gov. Roy Cooper often talks about the need for higher teacher pay. Meanwhile, Republicans in the GOP-controlled legislature brag about raising teacher salaries each of the past five years. Now, with teachers scheduled to rally in Raleigh on May 16 to raise awareness about the need for more education funding, one teacher’s story has gained traction in the politisphere. Nick Cols, a teacher from Western North Carolina, posted on Facebook that his \"take home pay\" for April was $1,715 after insurance and child-care and taxes were deducted. \"I am roughly being paid $53 a day to educate your child,\" he posted. PolitiFact usually sticks to fact-checking politicians, pundits, fake news sites and prominent organizational leaders. But this claim quickly gained traction not only in North Carolina news butacross the country. His story was shared by Cooper and others to emphasize their position that state lawmakers aren’t properly funding education. With that in mind, PolitiFact found it necessary to review his claim. We reached out to the teacher for comment on specifics of his salary, but didn’t hear back. He also deleted the post. So we then reached out to the public school system in Stokes County, where he works. What records show Wage information for public school teachers — and all government employees — is public record. So Melisa Jessup, executive director of human resources for Stokes County Schools and the district’s lead spokeswoman, provided PolitiFact with the teacher’s information. The teacher — whose full name is Nicholas Brandes — works at North Stokes High School and has been a teacher for nine years and eight months, Jessup said. That means, under thestate’s salary schedule for teachers with bachelor’s degrees, he qualifies for an annual salary of $40,550 from the state. (A first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree would receive a $35,000 salary, which would jump above $40,000 after 10 years, $45,000 after 15 years, and $50,000 after 23 years.) North Carolina’s public school teachers also receive supplements from their county governments. In Stokes County, that means Brandes getsabout 4 percent of his annual state salaryadded to his pay from the county. That would mean a teacher with his level of experience makes about $42,172 per year before taxes. On top of that, Brandes is currently an assistant coach for the football and wrestling teams. So he receives an additional $2,300 for each year that he coaches those teams. How his pay compares So that puts his annual salary at $44,472 before taxes, health insurance and childcare costs are taken out. That $44,472 salary is slightly higher than the most recent median income calculated for Stokes County —$42,489— but lower than the most recent median income calculated for all North Carolina residents,$48,256. The average salary for North Carolina teachers across the board (including all levels of experience) is$51,214. Some teachers choose to only accept checks during the school year, which runs from mid August to early June. Brandes chose to have his salary spread out over 12 months, so his monthly income is about $3,706. And, according to Jessup, his deductions for \"optional supplemental insurances and various other pre-tax deductions, as well as health insurance costs\" come out to about $954 a month. That includeschildcare. That leaves him with about $2,752 a month. Now let’s look at weekly and daily pay. Excluding holidays or days off, there are typically four five-day work weeks in a month. A monthly $2,752 paycheck spreads out to $688 a week and $137 a day. Checking the check Rather than speak hypothetically, let’s return to the $1,715 paycheck Brandes posted on Facebook. There appear to be problems with the teacher’s math. To arrive at the $53-per-day figure for April, Brandes would’ve had to divide $1,715 by 32 days. However, there were 30 days in April. More importantly, the school system told PolitiFact that Brades worked approximately 21.5 days in April. So his check for that month — $1,715 — divided by 21.5 equals $79.76 per day. That difference of $26.76 per day doesn’t sound like much. But extrapolated over 21.5 days, there’s a $575 difference between what readers might think Brandes earned in April versus what he actually made. Apply the same math ($575 times 12) over a year and there’s a difference of $6,906 between what Brandes could be taking home annually compared with what could be derived from Facebook and in the media. Our ruling A teacher in western North Carolina said he makes $53 a day, spurring politicians to use his claim to support their position that teachers across the state are underpaid. The difference between what the teacher claimed and what the records show is about $26.76. In other words, his daily pay in April was about 50 percent higher than he claimed it was. What teachers make is an important debate — one that should be won or lost on solid numbers. There are many ways of illustrating a correct number, but the $53/day is not the poster child it was made out to be. We rate this statement False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A website called The Sen Times recently published an article claiming that the Central Government is about to reduce the age of retirement of its employees form 60 to 50. The article also mentions that while such employees will get their pension payment order, the retirement benefits will only be provided after the post-COVID-19 economic crisis period. Refuting this claim, Jitendra Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, said on Sunday that there is no such move by the Centre. \"No move to reduce the retirement age of government employees, nor such a proposal discussed or contemplated at any level in the government,\" he said, according to an official press release.

The article mentions recession and social distancing as the two major reasons for the Centre to reduce the retirement age to 50. All the claims were attributed to an official source. According to the article, the reduction in retirement age was aimed at \"saving the life of older employees in the angle of social distancing.\" It also claims that there are \"studies that show that Indian people reaching the age of 50 years old tend to suffer from a decline of cognitive and physical abilities.\" However, we could not find any study that established such a pattern. As the article went viral, Rajya Sabha member Subramaniam Swamy also took to Twitter to express his apprehensions about the possibility of such a move.

            "[Evidences]:With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isn’t doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the state’s newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where he’ll face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clark’s campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: \"Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.\" Clark’s campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he \"voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District.\" What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldn’t help the uninsured, the Associated Press reported. The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans — and congressional records show Hudson was one of them. Several media outlets — including Business Insider, the Daily Mail and Yahoo! News — named Hudson among the bill’s Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clark’s campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudson’s vote. The campaign, which deleted its tweet about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasn’t issued a correction to its email. \"We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times,\" the campaign said. \"After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center.\" We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didn’t receive a response. Hudson’s office said the congressman’s March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudson’s advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers. \"Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didn’t change his vote,\" Shaw said. Clark said: \"Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.\" The congressional record and multiple media reports show Hudson voted yes. We rate Clark’s claim False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A video on social media falsely claimed to show Lucknow Super Giants captain KL Rahul crying after his team was defeated by RCB. The stage is set for the summit clash of the 15th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on May 29, Sunday. Meanwhile, a video of Lucknow Super Giants captain KL Rahul has started making rounds on social media. The video shows Rahul getting emotional following his team's defeat in the first eliminator game against RCB. While sharing this video, Facebook users have claimed that the LSG captain could not hold back tears following their exit from the tournament. A user posted this video with a caption that read, \"You never know this pain.\" The same video was shared on YouTube with some similar claims. An Archived version of such claims can be seen here and here. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found these posts to be misleading as the video is altered. A Snapchat filter was used to make KL Rahul teary-eyed. AFWA Probe We conducted a keyword search to know if any news reports have been published on the incident. However, there were no articles that supported the claim. We checked the repeat telecast of the match available on the streaming platform Hotstar next. Towards the end, losing captain KL Rahul appeared in front of the mike for the post-match reaction. At the 6 hours and 20 minutes mark, Rahul talks before the camera without expressing many emotions. It can be identified that scenes from this portion are the same as those in the viral video. So, is the video manipulated? To find out, we ran a few searches on platforms and software available to make people look emotional. Results suggested that a 'crying' filter of the popular social media app Snapchat could make this happen. The filter can make anyone look emotional even if they were happy faced in the original footage. When we applied this filter on the face of KL Rahul from the post-match conversation, it looked similar to the video now in circulation. A comparison of the original scenes and its copies applying the 'crying' filter can be seen here. Thus, it is safe to conclude that the video of KL Rahul getting emotional is an altered version created using a Snapchat filter. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Video shows KL Rahul, the captain of Lucknow Super Giants, getting emotional after his team was defeated by RCB in the first eliminator of IPL 2022. Conclusion This is a digitally altered video using the 'crying' filter on Snapchat. In the original video, KL Rahul was seen talking normally during the post-match conversation.

            "[Evidences]:On May 19 in Houston, Rick Perry revisited his objection to proposals to cap carbon emissions nationally, saying such a change would devastate the energy sector and the Texas economy, according to an online write-up by The Houston Chronicle.Referring to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, Perry said: \"My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.'\"To date, there’s no evidence of White supporting the \"cap-and-trade\" scheme. So his advising the Democratic president-elect on how to sell the idea amounts to rich campaign fodder for Perry.Does Perry recap White's message to Obama accurately?Some background: Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available to industry. Companies can trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they’re allowed. The House passed a bill last year to start such a system, but the legislation has not advanced through the Senate.To our request for elaboration, Perry’s campaign pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2008 e-mail sent by White, then mayor of Houston, to Rahm Emanuel, who was slotted to become Obama’s chief of staff. The eight-paragraph e-mail, later noted by Perry's campaign in blog posts and an online video advertisement, surfaced on a Chronicle blog on May 18, 2010. White's campaign confirmed the e-mail's authenticity.Several times, White’s message to Emanuel, under the subject line \"Energy Policy at the Beginning of an Administration,\" refers to the cap-and-trade possibility. Each mention advises against an early push.White’s e-mail says Obama should focus on \"several high-impact objectives during his first year to make steady progress to meet energy policy goals while also stimulating the economy. But he should not try to do something ‘comprehensive’ on domestic carbon emissions until these tools are in place.\"Later, the e-mail says: \"Avoid during 2009 wading into the mire of cap-and-trade or user taxes on carbon before the new Administration and Congress has made progress\" on White’s energy-related recommendations.White’s e-mail says: \"A carbon-based tax or sales (scheme) could be characterized as intrusive government increasing costs or simply another scheme to extract money from the public unless there is a clear ‘path forward’ on (a) transportation fuel efficiency; (b) efficiency of electrical power use; and (c) affordable clean power alternatives.\"The message continues: \"The public can understand why we need to lower energy costs, reduce emissions, and cut imports. We can accomplish that goal while reducing carbon emissions. But do not allow the concept of reducing carbon emissions to drive this process. Lowering energy bills with clean domestic energy is a much better approach.\"White’s recommended to-do’s? His e-mail says Obama should accelerate the use of vehicles that use 40 miles per gallon or more. More advice: fund a program to retrofit 1 million homes and apartments occupied by low-income residents. And, he writes, Obama should encourage new power plants to use cleaner-than-coal natural gas, among steps.White’s campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, said White referred to the cap-and-trade prospect because the idea was debated during the 2008 election year. In his campaign, Obama committed to creating a cap-and-trade system — a promise that PolitiFact has lately rated \"in the works.\" Next, we contacted an Austin advertising firm to get another take on whether White's e-mail reads like advice on how to sell cap and trade, as Perry puts it. Patrick Cline, a partner at JH&A Advertising, credited White's message with couching in step with an understanding that a cap-and-trade plan could wreak havoc with the state's petrochemical plants. But, Cline said, White's note stops short of being a primer on selling cap and trade to the American people. Our conclusion: White's e-mail is not close to the \"how-to\" guide Perry claims. Indeed, White's message urges the incoming administration not to push a carbon emissions proposal until after it has advanced other energy-related ideas. Nowhere does the e-mail offer guidance on pitching cap and trade. Perry floats a politically potent but inaccurate, ridiculous characterization. Pants on Fire!\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"We see a quarter-billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Providence Mayor Angel Taveras had to deal with near bankruptcy in the capital city after he took office in 2011. As the city struggled to fix its budget problems, he won union concessions to reduce pension costs. But critics question how far the pension deal negotiated by Taveras, now a candidate for governor, went to fix the problem. The most recent figures released last month show the plan is only 31.4-percent funded. Republican mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop raised the issue during the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of WPRI's \"Newsmakers\" program. Asked why he wants to run again, he said the city needs a mayor who will stay around to solve the city's long-term problems and not have aspirations for higher office, like Taveras and his predecessor, David Cicilline, now a member of Congress. \"We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion,\" Harrop said. That would mean that the city, at the time, had a pension system that was only 20 percent funded. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office says public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) First, we need to explain why we're ruling on a seemingly-straightforward statement two months after it was made. We began work on this item in December but getting up-to-date numbers about the city's pension fund turned out to be maddeningly difficult. The city was often slow to respond and listed different amounts in different reports over different time frames. We decided to wait for the completion of the latest estimate of the city's accrued liability, in part because the city has refused to release an earlier actuary report for the year ending June 30, 2012, citing a dispute over its accuracy. Finally, a week ago, the city released the latest actuarial report, for the year ending June 30, 2013, allowing us to proceed. So let’s go back to December, when Harrop made his statement. At that point, we asked Harrop about his figures. He cited two blog postings on the Providence pension system from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com. One, published Oct. 30, reported that the fund had $283 million in assets on Oct. 22. The other, published Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of \"almost $1.2 billion.\" Harrop also cited a 2011 city report saying the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million. We don't know the precise status of the pension system the day Harrop made his statement. But now that we have the up-to-date financial reports, we do have a snapshot of what the system's assets and liabilities were as of June 30, 2013. According to that latest actuary report, released Jan. 31, 2014, on June 30 the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations. On that point, Harrop turns out to have been right on the money. At the same time, according to both the actuary report and the city's latest annual financial report, released about a month after Harrop made his statement, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets, a lot more than what Harrop stated. The amount in the city's investment account was $247 million. In addition, there was $3 million in cash and $59 million the city paid into the fund that year. Finally, the report counted as an asset $26 million owed to the fund from loans made to people in the retirement system at a rate of 9.25 percent, according to David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Taveras. Add all those together and you get the $336 million. In Harrop’s defense, at the time he made his statement, up-to-date data on the city’s pension obligations were not available. The city was withholding it as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, who the city accused of making \"fundamental and inexcusable errors\" in its 2012 pension calculations. This year Providence used a different firm, Segal Consulting. Our ruling In December, Daniel Harrop said, \"We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.\" Harrop was citing numbers from different sources and different years, and those numbers are moving targets. They all support his underlying point: Providence's pension program is woefully underfunded, even with recent concessions negotiated with the city's unions. Based on the latest report of the city's actuary, which was not available at the time Harrop made his statement, the candidate was correct on his $1.2 billion figure. At the same time, there was significantly more than a quarter billion dollars set aside in the city's coffers for pension costs. But the number he cited accurately reflected the approximate amount the city had in its investment portfolio. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.

            "[Evidences]:One of the hot-button issues of the 2013 General Assembly session was whether the state should repay the bonds sold to help finance 38 Studios, the now-bankrupt video-game company founded by former Boston Red Sox player Curt Schilling. One state representative who has argued against repayment is Charlene Lima, a Democrat from Cranston. She told the House on June 26 that, before the bonds were sold in November 2010, she had been promised by the executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Commission (RIEDC) that taxpayers would not have to foot the bill if the deal with 38 Studios didn't live up to its promise. \"When I was complaining to the former director, Keith Stokes, he sent me a letter and he said the taxpayers will never be on the hook for these bonds, for this money,\" Lima said. \"How was this properly vetted by these people if they were saying the taxpayers wouldn't be on the hook? And guess what. Today they ARE on the hook.\" We're not going to get into the merits of the state’s controversial decision to start paying the cost of the \"moral obligation\" bonds, but we wondered whether Stokes, who resigned after 38 Studios collapsed, really had made a specific pledge in writing. We called Lima and she quickly forwarded a copy of an Oct. 4, 2010 letter from Stokes in which he complained that Lima had offered an \"inaccurate characterization of this investment and the RIEDC's degree of concern for Rhode Island taxpayers\" in a news release she had authored. At the time, the bond sale had been approved and the bonds themselves were about to be sold. Stokes wrote, \"In the unlikely event that the company is not able to meet its debt obligations,\" the state would have first crack at 38 Studio's assets. \"These collateral assets, in addition to the debt repayment reserves, would be used to pay back the loan before the application of any public funds would be considered. \"This ensures that under no circumstances would taxpayers be asked to repay $75 million.\" As Lima now notes, taxpayers are being asked to pay the money. (The $8.2-billion state budget, which the General Assembly passed and Governor Chafee signed, included $2.5 million for the first required taxpayer payment on the bonds. The total owed, with interest, is about $112.6 million.) To sum up, Lima said she received a letter in 2010 from then-RIEDC official Keith Stokes in which he insisted that Rhode Islanders would not be on the hook for the 38 Studios bonds. Lima earned a Pants on Fire last month for a comment she made about Rhode Island's failure to pass the Constitutional amendment authorizing the federal income tax. \"If my pants were on fire,\" she said, \"what is he? A towering inferno?\" We don't have varying levels of conflagration. And in this case, we're simply judging the claim Lima made on the House floor. She has the evidence and we rate her statement True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [emailprotected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)\n",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Apparently obsessed with the fact that he lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes — and only narrowly achieved an Electoral College win — Trump a few weeks after the election tweeted this: Trump’s fixation with this apparently started with a few tweets by Gregg Phillips, a self-described conservative voter fraud specialist, who started making claims even before data on voter history was actually available in most jurisdictions. (It had not even been determined which provisional ballots were valid and would be counted.) These claims were then picked up by such purveyors of false facts as Infowars.com, a conspiracy-minded website, even though Phillips declined to provide any evidence to back it up. Advertisement After Trump’s tweet, the Trump transition team then scrambled to come up with proof, but could only resurrect claims and data that had been previously rejected as irrelevant during the campaign. None of the information supported Trump’s claim of “millions” of illegal votes, just isolated instances of voting irregularities. Both Trump’s claim and the Trump team’s effort to justify it earned Four Pinocchios. As of December, just four documented cases of voter fraud have been identified. Our colleague Philip Bump calculated that voter fraud amounted to 0.000002 percent of the ballots cast in the race for the White House — if they counted, which they don’t. As we noted in November: “Now that Trump is on the verge of becoming president, he needs to be more careful about making wild allegations with little basis in fact, especially if the claim emerged from a handful of tweets and conspiracy-minded websites. He will quickly find that such statements will undermine his authority on other matters.” Advertisement Well, now he’s president.

            "[Evidences]:A message is being widely shared on social media with a claim that, according to a research paper in the Journal of Virology (April 1991), eating alkaline foods, which have a pH level above 8.5, can kill the latest Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which cause COVID-19). Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here Claim: Eating alkaline foods of pH level above 8.5 can kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Fact: The research paper published in 1991 talks about the MHV4 virus, not about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some of the pH levels given in the post are not correct. Also, there is no scientific evidence to prove that eating alkaline foods can kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. The 1991 research paper mentioned in the post can be found here. It can be read that it mentions about the ‘Mouse Hepatitis Virus type 4 (MHV4)’, not about the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which was first reported only in 2019). The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. But, in the post, it can be seen that the pH levels of some foods are above 14. Also, the pH of lemon is around 2, not 9.9. Neither WHO nor the Government of India has suggested any alkaline-based diet to kill Coronavirus. In the Africa Check article, it can be read that Oyewale Tomori (Virology Professor with the WHO) said, “Coronavirus has nothing to do with the stomach, so how do these ‘alkaline foods’, like lemon, lime, avocado, and garlic, beat the virus? This claim should be ignored”. To sum it up, a message suggesting that ‘alkaline foods can kill SARS-CoV-2 virus’ is fake. Did you watch our new video?\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Donald Trump was \"forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:In an effort to take out frontrunner Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates have pelted Trump with criticism over his multiple trips to federal bankruptcy court. That criticism was on full display in CNN’s Republican debate Sept. 16. Most notably, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticized Trump’s history of bankruptcies in his businesses. \"You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money,\" Fiorina said. \"That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\" Trump doesn’t deny that four of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy. He argues, however, that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision, and he was smart to make the moves when he did. \"Hundreds of companies\" have filed for bankruptcy, Trump said earlier in the debate. \"I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job.\" Trump’s four bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations (named for its location in federal bankruptcy code), which are designed to restructure businesses without shutting them down completely. The purpose is to \"save\" the business, as opposed to other forms of bankruptcy which would liquidate the company, said Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm who has extensive experience with Chapter 11. Because they keep coming up, we decided to outline Trump’s four bankruptcies. We also talked to some finance experts, who told us Trump is correct that Chapter 11 reorganization is not always the result of bad business decisions. Bankruptcy 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 The first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most significant in terms of his personal finances, according to news reports at the time. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy 2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel’s CEO, but it was merely a gesture -- he didn’t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel’s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times. Bankruptcy 3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy 4: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts --was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. After debating with the company’s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. So four Trump companies filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Is that as big a deal as Fiorina says? Risky business While it would be better to avoid a situation where Chapter 11 reorganization is necessary, filing for bankruptcy can be a \"sound business decision\" when the company is facing serious financial problems, Venditto said. It’s better than the business shutting down completely. \"However, the source of the financial problems varies from case to case,\" he said. \"Sometimes it is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the business. Sometime it caused by poor judgment. More frequently, it is a combination.\" Trump’s four bankruptcies all happened within the past 25 years. That’s a lot, said Stephen Lubben, a leading expert in corporate finance and professor at Seton Hall School of Law. But to be fair, the gaming industry has been struggling the past few years, he added, and three out of four of Trump’s bankruptcies were tied to casinos. It’s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for the four bankruptcies because he’s acting as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, said Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University. He added that people typically wouldn’t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. \"The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,\" Levitan said. \"These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him.\" Our ruling Fiorina said Trump was \"forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\" While it is accurate that Trump filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy four times, Fiorina’s statement doesn’t tell the whole story. In context, Fiorina’s phrasing suggests Trump was personally responsible for the failures of these businesses, but in reality, much was out of Trump’s control -- such as a struggling casino industry. But Trump is certainly not blameless. We rate Fiorina’s statement Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Former vice president Joe Biden has spoken out against violence incited during demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, and his official policy platform calls for doing away with cash bail. But there is no evidence that his presidential campaign donated $20 million to bail out protesters. A post on Facebook that is critical of both the demonstrators and Democrats claims otherwise: \"Joe Biden campaign has donated 20 million dollars to bail out rioters what the hell does that tell you about the democrats.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not accurate. First, not everyone who has been arrested during protests could fairly be described as \"rioters.\" Those arrested have included curfew violators, working press and others. Next, several campaign staff members did donate their own money to a Minnesota nonprofit that pays the bail for low-income individuals. But the campaign itself did not donate the money and there is no evidence for the $20 million figure. President Donald Trump said that Biden campaign staff members donating money for protesters’ bail are \"working to get the Anarchists out of jail.\" When we posed the question to the Biden campaign, a campaign official cited the candidate’s public anti-violence statements and his official platform that calls for eliminating cash bail. But there is no evidence the campaign itself donated $20 million. \"Several of our staff members exercised their First Amendment right to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, on an individual basis,\" a Biden campaign official told us. \"Vice President Biden supports the elimination of cash bail.\" About 13 Biden campaign staff members posted on Twitter that they made donations to the fund, Reuters reported, with one posting an image of a $50 receipt. The Minnesota Freedom Fund is a nonprofit that opposes the practice of cash bail and uses donations to pay bail \"for low-income individuals who cannot otherwise afford it,\" the organization says on its website. \"People of color and immigrants face higher rates of arrest, harsher sentencing, and disparities in the setting of bail compared to white citizens. We pay bail as a way to reduce harm to individuals in the immediate term. But we never lose sight of our mission to abolish cash bail and have the burden of proof for pretrial risk fall on prosecutors, not the accused.\" In an effort to find out where the $20 million figure might have originated, we found a May 30 Forbes report that said the Minnesota Freedom Fund raised about $20 million — in total from all donors — over four days following George Floyd’s death in police custody. The Minnesota Freedom Fund told PolitiFact that no one donor has contributed $20 million. \"We have had over $30 million in donations since the police murder of George Floyd, from over 900,000 donors, with an average donation of about $30,\" a spokesperson wrote in a June 3email. \"No one donor nor one small group of donors donated $20 million.\" The fund is no longer soliciting donations and is encouraging people to donate to Floyd’s family and other local organizations run by black community members. A Facebook post says that Biden’s campaign donated $20 million to bail \"rioters\" out of jail. The campaign says individual staff members, not the campaign, donated money to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. There is no evidence that totaled to $20 million, however. That’s the total amount the organization said it raised from all donors in the first few days following Floyd’s death. The post assumes that every person the nonprofit assists is violent and ignores the individuals who may have been detained during peaceful protests. We rate this False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Two photographs taken of Fort Denison in Sydney Harbor, Australia — one a black-and-white photo from the 19th century and the other a modern, full-color picture — are circulating with the claim that they show the sea level in that area has not changed in over a century, thus (supposedly) disproving climate change. Help, help, the sky is falling,. pic.twitter.com/d4nkeKtIef We found by conducting a reverse image search that iterations of the same meme have been shared online since at least 2018. In July 2022, it was shared to Twitter, falsely claiming that “unprecedented climate change” had caused “sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.” To draw such a conclusion from a photo comparison is erroneous. As we have previously reported, these types of oversimplified memes are meant to discredit science without taking into account a number of environmental factors that may influence sea level in the area, including, as some social media users pointed out, the very simple fact that ocean tides fluctuate over predictable timeframes Carly Shabot with California Sea Grant told Snopes that one “cannot compare photos without more information as they may have been taken at different tides or times.” “Sea levels can appear higher or lower depending on the time, day and season each photo was taken,” added Shabot. Because the meme did not provide further information about when the photographs were captured, as well as during which tide, using a comparison of the two pictures to make an argument is not credible. Both images appear to feature Fort Denison, a heritage-listed part of Sydney Harbor National Park located in the eastern Australian city. The black-and-white image shows the fort as it stood in the 1880s, though some accounts note that the photo was taken in 1885, according to the National Archives of Australia. To say that the sea level in the Sydney, Australia region have not risen since the 19th-century is false. While sea level rise in that specific area is less than the global average, NOAA reports that the relative sea level trend is .75 millimeters each year, or .029 inches. It’s an admittedly small level and one that may not be detectable by the naked eye, but it’s a rise nonetheless. Again, as we’ve previously reported, sea level around the planet is rising on average, but at very different rates, which depend on many factors, including ocean tides and currents. For more information about those many variables or about the history of sea level rise, you can check out this Snopes explainer: No, That Plymouth Rock Meme Doesn’t Disprove Rise in Sea Level.

            "claim [Claim]: \"The United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of (NATO), depending on the way you calculate.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Since his earliest days in office, President Donald Trump has made no bones about his feelings on how much the United States spends on NATO, often scolding allies for not carrying their weight. This week he was in Brussels for a summit with those very nations he’s unhappy with. One talking point came up again and again. As he left the White House for Europe, Trump tweeted that the United States is paying for 90 percent of NATO with other member countries falling far behind. In a short speech before he boarded his plane, he repeated his frustration but dialed back the size of the U.S. share, saying \"we spend at least 70 percent for NATO.\" And in a July 12, 2018, press conference before he left Brussels, Trump decided to use both numbers to describe a lopsided U.S. contribution: \"I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important, probably the greatest ever done. But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate. That's not fair to the United States.\" Regardless of the figure used, it is not accurate to say that the United States is paying for either 70 or 90 percent of NATO’s military defense. We first consulted NATO’s latest budget report for 2017. (A report with projected 2018 defense spending was released after Trump’s initial comment, but this doesn’t change the facts surrounding the claim.) The 2017 numbers show defense spending data of all member countries from 2010 to 2016 and 2017 estimates. By NATO’s count, total defense spending of all NATO members stood at about $957 billion in 2017. The United States’ share was about $686 billion. Do the math, and the percentage of U.S. spending is about 72 percent. (We don’t know the source for the 90 percent number.) Here are the top four spending countries on NATO’s list: Country Spending in billions (2017) Percent of total defense spending by NATO members United States $686 71.7% United Kingdom $55 5.8% France $46 4.8% Germany $45 4.8% But what do these numbers mean? The spending doesn’t represent money spent on behalf of NATO, nor for NATO. They’re the total defense budgets of NATO members. For 2017, the defense spending of all NATO members totaled about $957 billion. The United States spent $686 billion on all of its defense spending across the globe for that year. Gordon Adams, professor emeritus at American University’s School of International Service, said the president’s wording is \"bizarre\" given that the burden for defense is quite different for the United States and European nations. \"U.S. defense missions are global, not just European,\" he said, \"while the allies spend solely for European defense.\" American defense spending supports aircraft carriers in the Pacific, as well as troops in Europe. On top of that, Adams said that U.S. equipment and personnel in Europe, such as an F-35 stealth fighter, can be deployed for missions in the Middle East. There is no clear way to tease out the fraction of American defense spending that primarily guards Europe. NATO does have things it calls its own. There is a civilian staff and headquarters, and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, command headquarters and a program to beef up military capabilities in certain countries above and beyond what they would need for their own defense. Each of the 29 members contribute to those costs through an agreed cost-sharing formula based on the country’s gross domestic product. As the member with the largest GDP, the U.S. contributed 22 percent of NATO’s common funding. Not far behind is Germany with about 15 percent, then France and the United Kingdom with about 10 percent. With common costs of about $2.5 billion in 2017, the U.S. share of about $550 million doesn’t change the picture, since Europe’s share was a much larger $1.8 billion. That gap only weakens Trump’s argument. Trump said \"the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of (NATO).\" It is not accurate to say the United States pays for the majority ofNATO's costs.The United States pays for 22 percent of NATO's common fund. Beyond that relatively small amount, the cost of NATO is undefined. The organization does totalthe defense budgets of its members, and based on that, U.S.defense spending equals about 70 percent. But the United States spends as much as it does because it is a global military power, which by and large, the European members are not. It is an apples and oranges comparison. Trump pushed a flawed comparison even further by saying the U.S. paid for as much as 90 percent of NATO.That goes beyond the exaggeration of this statistic that we've seen before. Trump’s statement contains just an element of truth, ignoring critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:An old video of cheetahs hunting an impala in Kenya is being shared to claim that Namibian cheetahs have killed 200 deers at Kuno National Park. Context: Eight cheetahs were brought from Namibia and released in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno National Park on September 17, 2022. Since then, pictures and videos of these feral cats have gone viral on social media. In the above context, a viral video of three cheetahs killing an impala is being circulated along with a narrative that recently released Namibian cheetahs are attacking a deer. The English translation of one Twitter post, which included the viral video, said, ''Where are those fake animal lovers who come before Bakra Eid and shout everywhere, look here 200 deer were put to death.'' The post notes that Salman Khan faced massive criticism for allegedly killing black bucks and questions whether there are no laws for wildlife now. The words \"Namibian cheetah\" and \"Indian deer\" were included in the English translation of the Hindi text over the video, which claimed that an innocent animal had been deliberately offered to the cheetahs. Several similar posts claimed that deers from a different state were brought to Kuno National Park so the new cheetahs could hunt them. In fact: With a reverse image search on one of the video's keyframes, we found the extended version of it on the YouTube channel \"Lemurt Wildlife.\" The video is titled, \"Kisaru one of the senior matriarch in the Mara ecosystem with her cubs killed an impala.\" A shorter version of the same video is available on its Facebook page. According to the geotag, the video is from Kenya, not India. The description says the attack occurred on an impala, not a deer, as the posts claimed. The video was uploaded on August 17, precisely one month before the cheetahs from Namibia were brought to India. Under Project Cheetah, the world's first intercontinental large wild carnivore translocation project, wild Cheetahs, which had gone extinct in India, were introduced to Kuno National Park in September 2022. The Press Information Bureau states, ''the release of wild Cheetahs by the Prime Minister in Kuno National Park is part of his efforts to revitalize and diversify India's wildlife and its habitat.'' Some social media posts alleged that deers were brought to Kuno National Park from various states so the new cheetahs could hunt them. So, we conducted a keyword search connected to the release of deers in the national park as prey for the cheetahs. We found a tweet from the Madhya Pradesh Forest department posted on September 21, 2022. The English translation of the Hindi text stated that the Kuno National Park is home to many chitals (a kind of deer native to the Indian continent). It also mentioned that no chital had been brought to the wildlife park. In the Hindu report dated September 20, Jasbir Singh Chauhan, the Chief Wildlife Warden for Madhya Pradesh, claims that the state had many wildlife parks with considerable chitals and clarified that no chital was introduced to Kuno National Park as cheetahs' prey. This statement was in response to the Bishnoi community's protests following reports that chitals had been relocated from Rajasthan to Kuno National Park to provide food for Namibian cheetahs. He also stated that chitals were relocated so that they wouldn't graze on harvested crops and harm the livelihood of the people living nearby. He further clarified that, in contrast to claims that the relocations are carried out to provide the cheetah's prey, the primary objective of any chital relocation is to improve the animals' access to food and water. The viral Twitter post claimed 200 deers were killed in the first three weeks after the cheetahs were released in the national park. Yet, the assertion is unfounded, and no official reports corroborate such statistical estimates. The viral post also raised concerns about the status of law and order by linking the actor Salman Khan's decades-old blackbuck poaching case and insinuating that 200 deers were killed in this case. While specific Indian laws or ordinances address the protection of wild animals, the post's purpose is malicious and aims to provoke the public against the government. The verdict: To summarize, an old video of cheetahs killing an impala in Kenya is being falsely shared as Namibian cheetahs killing a deer at Kuno National Park. The Madhya Pradesh Forest Department has disputed rumors that chital was moved to Kuno National Park for predation by newly arrived cheetahs. The assertion that approximately 200 deers were killed in less than three weeks after the cheetahs arrived in the national park is also unfounded. Hence, the claims made in the Twitter post are false. \n",

            "[Evidences]:A Facebook post says a quote from Roman public speaker and statesman Ciceroamounts to\"atwo thousand Year Old warning about TRUMP.\" The quote reads: \"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. For the traitor appears not a traitor – He speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation – he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city – he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared.\" The words, with some slightly different iterations, have been widely attributed to Cicero across the internet for some time, but we could find no evidence that he actually said or wrote it. (Additionally, he died in 43 B.C., a year before the meme claims he said the quote.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We traced the quote down to a 1965 fictional novel by Taylor Caldwell called \"A Pillar of Iron.\" On page 661 of the book, it attributes the passage to a speech Cicero made in the Roman Senate in 58 B.C. as \"Recorded by Sallust.\" While the novel often includes recorded speeches and letters of Cicero, it is a work of fiction, and the passage could not be located in online archives or compiled works of Cicero’s writings and addresses. Catherine Steel, professor of classics at the University of Glasgow, told PolitiFact she has not come across this quote in any of Cicero’s work. \"I'm not aware that this is translation of any work of Cicero,\" Steel wrote in an email. \"The idea of an internal threat does surface in his speeches against Catiline from 63 B.C., particularly e.g. 2.11, but there aren't any close parallels in terms of language.\" Besides the quote appearing in a 1965 fictional novel, no official documentation of Cicero’s extensive writings or speeches includes anything close to the passage.

            "[Evidences]:The graphic was shared more than 200 times after it was posted on Facebook here on March 14, 2021. The post’s Tagalog-language caption states in part: \"Vice President Leni Robredo got a big lead in a survey conducted by EDS where she got 26%, higher than Senator Bong Go's 14% and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte's 8%.\" The graphic purports to show Robredo won a local poll on who Filipinos would like to replace Duterte as president, securing 26% of the vote. The post circulated online after local media ramped up coverage of potential candidates to replace Duterte, whose term expires in 2022. Robredo — who was elected vice president separately from President Duterte, per Philippine law — currently leads the political opposition. The post also specifically names Duterte ally and current Senator Bong Go; and Duterte's daughter Sara, the current mayor of Davao City. The graphic was also shared alongside a similar claim here, here and here on Facebook; and here on TikTok. The graphic, however, has been doctored. Reverse image and keyword searches on Google found the original graphic was published on Facebook by local news organisation One News here on December 31, 2020. The original graphic shows Sara Duterte in fact received 26% of the vote, while Robredo received 8%. The percentage of votes for Go has been swapped with those of Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., who narrowly lost to Robredo in the 2016 vice presidential race. The One News report reads: “One out of four Filipinos would vote for Sara Duterte as the country’s new president, according to the results of a Pulse Asia survey. “The survey was conducted from November 23, 2020 to December 2, 2020 based on a sample of 2,400 adults. It has a ± 2% error margin at the 95% confidence level.” Below is a screenshot comparison of the doctored graphic (L) and the original One News graphic (R): The numbers indicated in the One News report correspond with the survey findings published by Pulse Asia on December 31, 2020. Multiple keyword searches found no record of any Philippine polling firm called “EDS”, which the misleading Facebook post claims conducted the survey. In a Facebook message to AFP on March 26, 2021, One News said their graphic had been doctored in the misleading Facebook posts.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Claim: Nigerian students refuse COVID-19 vaccine by jumping off a two-storey school building Source: Viral WhatsApp video and audio Verdict: False Researched by Nii Larte Lartey A viral 30-second-long video showing several students jumping off the first floor of a two-storey school building is being depicted as showing how students refused COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria. An audio note which is being passed around together with the video on WhatsApp has someone speaking in pidgin English who cautions the public against COVID-19 vaccines. The speaker who was running commentary on what was happening in the 30-second-long video partly said: “Many students are jumping from the school building. You see this thing they call corona [Coronavirus]. This is the vaccine they bring in Nigeria in one of the biggest schools… They bring this vaccine to give it to these students and that is why you see many of them jumping to run away. These people said none of the black people die from this corona, so this is why they want to kill lots of people from this corona.” Two questions we seek to answer Whether the video is being accurately represented? Whether Nigeria has started vaccinating its citizens? Fact-check What immediately raises suspicion about the claim is that none of the students seen running was wearing a facemask; a safety protocol that has become mandatory amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Using the Invid video verification tool, it was found that the video emerged sometime in May 2019 and has nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria. The video shows a stampede that ensued following the detonation of a tear gas canister at a community secondary school, Oroworukwo, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria and has featured in a news report by TVC News Nigeria which was published on their verified YouTube channel on May 27, 2019. Meanwhile, Nigeria has not started COVID-19 vaccination because the country is yet to receive the more than 16 million doses of AstraZeneca/Oxford (AZ/SII) COVID-19 vaccine allocated to the country under the COVAX programme. The distribution of AZ/SII vaccines for the first half of 2021 to countries that signed up under COVAX’s advance market commitment will be in 2 batches with 35-40 percent of the allocation to be made available in the first quarter and the remaining 60-65 percent in the second quarter. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also assured that vaccination is safe and side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. A credible fact-checking organisation in Nigeria, Dubawa has flagged a similar claim made in the Hausa language using the same video as false. Verdict The viral video is being mischaracterized and misrepresented and has nothing to do with efforts to administer COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria. The claims are false.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Portland City Council member Amanda Fritz talks a lot about the money she’s saved the city. It’s a central theme in her pitch for a second term on the council.In a recent campaign mailer, Fritz highlights some of the places she’s been able to earn her keep -- such as when she oversaw the Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management (now the office for Community Technology). \"Saving money with tough audits,\" the mailer reads. \"Amanda Fritz oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees.\"Any time a politician takes credit for an audit we get a little suspicious -- often they’re not directly involved in the process. So we decided to check this one out.We called Fritz’s policy adviser, Tim Crail, who told us the audit in question was on XO Communications Services. As Crail explained it, an audit of the city’s contract with the company revealed that it had paid none of the franchise fees due to the city for nearly a decade. The city was owed nearly $2.5 million.Initially the city was poised to settle for some $1.3 million, he said, but Fritz, who oversaw the office at the time, \"did not want to settle\" and pushed to recoup the full amount. Eventually, the city succeeded in doing just that. Crail forwarded us an email that backed up this version of events.We also pulled a copy of the agenda item that approved final settlement with the city’s e-file document archive. It backed up the $2.44 million figure that we’d received from Crail. But it also raised a few questions for us.The item showed a timeline for the audit and eventual settlement that began well before Fritz was in office. The initial audit took place in 2006 and was further bolstered by further investigation in 2007. Fritz didn’t take office until 2008.To be sure, that was the year that negotiations toward a settlement began in earnest.It’s probably also worth noting that even if Fritz had been the commissioner in charge of the bureau when it began, she would not have been involved all that much in it.We spoke with Mary Beth Henry, the manager for Community Technology, and she explained that most audits are done according to a routine schedule, usually a three- or five-year cycle.It’s not until a company is \"not responding to our information requests and we begin to suspect they're not paying the right amount\" that the office will go to the commissioner in charge for permission to litigate.That’s around the time Fritz became involved. The city granted permission to litigate and, according to the agenda item, \"negotiations resumed, and the parties … agreed to settle the issues for the full amount of past due principal and interest.\"In her mailer, Fritz said that she \"oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees.\" Indeed, while she oversaw the Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management, the city settled a franchise dispute worth nearly $2.5 million. Still, some clarification is necessary -- namely that the audit began well before she was in office and also that the city was poised to get $1.3 million of the amount due before she intervened. She did push to get more than initially offered, but it’s not as though the city would have left empty-handed otherwise.We rate this claim Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:We've seen versions of this post about state support for pensioners and refugees, which has been shared almost 2,000 times on Facebook, before. We first checked the very same figures back in 2012 , and we also checked a similar version last year . It's incorrect on every figure. A full British state pension (before top-ups and without partner support) is worth either £126 a week or £164 a week (around £6,500 or £8,500 per year) depending on when you were born. Partner support for a state pension recipient is worth up to £68 a week (around £3,500 per year)—but has not been open to new applicants since 2010 and will end next year. People staying in the UK illegally aren't entitled to claim anything from the UK state. Refugees in the UK (in other words, people who have had an asylum claim approved) aren't entitled to any particular benefits aimed at them. They can receive the same benefit and pension payments as any UK citizen. It is theoretically possible to receive £29,900 a year in household benefits, but this would be unusually high. Asylum seekers (who are applying for refugee status in the UK) are entitled to around £38 per week per person if they are homeless and unable to afford food. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What can a British pensioner claim? The full basic state pension is £125.95 a week (excluding top ups ) for a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953. Pensioners born after this date can claim the new state pension—the full weekly rate is £164.35. People need to have 30 qualifying years (or 35 for the new state pension) of national insurance contributions to claim the full rate. Given that the viral image refers to a pensioner who paid national insurance their entire working life, we can assume that they have the 30 qualifying years. This means a full state pension is worth around £6,500 a year before top-ups—or around £8,500 if it's the new state pension. We are not aware of any \"hardship allowance\" for pensioners, but they can claim state benefits (some of which are pensioner-specific) to help with their income. What about pensioners' spouses? A pensioner's spouse may be entitled to a state pension in their own right. Additionally, a state pensioner may get an \" Adult Dependency Increase \" if they have a partner who is financially dependent on them. The Department for Work and Pensions told us the full rate is £68.35 a week—around £3,500 a year. However, this hasn't been open to new applicants since 2010, and will stop in April 2020. What can someone who is in the country illegally claim? Nothing. People who are staying in the UK illegally are likely to be removed if their immigration status is discovered by the authorities, so they wouldn't be able to claim benefits without alerting the authorities to their status. They inherently do not have the right to work in the UK. What can a refugee claim? It depends whether you're talking about an asylum seeker or a refugee . An asylum seeker (who is making an application for refugee status in the UK) can get £37.75 per week, if they are homeless and not able to afford food. They can also be allocated some form of accommodation (which they cannot choose and is unlikely to be in London or the South East). Asylum seekers don't get a \"spouse allowance\", rather an asylum seeker's spouse would be entitled to the same amount in their own right if they were also seeking asylum. We aren't aware of any \"hardship allowance\" for refugees (as was the case when we checked the claim in 2011 ), and have asked the Home Office for more information. This means an asylum seeker's total entitlement is £37.75 per week (or £2,000 per year)—well below the £675 per week claimed in the viral image. Where does the £29,900 figure come from? If an asylum seeker is granted refugee status in the UK, they could then claim benefits, tax credits and pension payments on the same basis as UK nationals. There aren't any specific benefits available just for refugees. It is theoretically possible —but very unlikely—for a refugee household to receive £29,900 a year in benefits, just as it is for UK nationals. This would only occur if they weren't subject to the benefit cap. Under the cap, the maximum total benefits a household in London containing a couple or a single person with children can receive is £23,000, or around £442 a week. The cap is lower if you're a single adult or live outside London. Some people are not affected by the benefits cap, for example people over state pension age, and people getting Universal Credit because of a disability or health condition that stops them working.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A newspaper article urging more recycling in Nigeria made a number of claims about the waste produced in the country.Its claim that Nigeria produced 0.65 kilograms of waste per person a day was mostly correct. But not data shows that the country generates over 62 tonnes of waste a year.Two claims on Lagos’s waste generation and the city’s population were unproven.Piling waste posed a “grave danger” to people in Nigeria, a national newspaper said, putting them at risk of environmental hazards and epidemics.As Africa’s most populous country struggled to come to grips with the problem, recycling solid waste could help prevent disasters, Nigeria’sGuardiansaidin May 2019.The article made a number of claims about waste in Nigeria. We checked four of them.Claim “Nigeria generates over 62 million tonnes of waste a year.” Verdict incorrectThe article’s statistics were gathered duringa development awards ceremonyin Lagos in March 2019, its author Adaku Onyenucheya told Africa Check.She could not recall who had provided the figures as a recording had been lost. But she said she had been referring to waste in general, not only solid waste as the headline ofthe reportsuggests.TheUN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizationdefines waste as “material left over after products have been made by producers and after they have been used by consumers”.We tracedthe figureof 62 million tonnes to a 2012World Bank report titledWhat a waste: A global review of solid wastemanagement.But the statistic was for sub-Saharan Africa. The reportestimatedthat Nigeria alone produced 40,959 tonnes of municipal solid waste a day,or 14.95 million tonnes a year.It definedmunicipal solid wasteas waste collected by municipalities from residences, industries, institutions and construction.The2018 editionof the report has data for 2016, when solid waste generation in Nigeria rose to34.6 million tonnes. But it did not have data on non-solid or liquid waste, according to thebank’sSocial, Urban, Rural and Resilienceunit.We therefore rate this claim as incorrect based on the most recent publicly available national data.How were these figures calculated?To arrive at its most recent estimate, the World Bank relied on a number of sources. These included peer-reviewed journal articles and cited academic papers. Where data was not available, it relied on its studies and those from other donors or project documents.Models were then used to project future waste generation. These suggested that Nigeria would produce 54.8 million tonnes of solid waste in 2030, and 107 million tonnes in 2050.There was an acute lack of data on waste management in Nigeria and many other African countries, said Prof Oladele Osibanjo, president of the Lagos-based Waste Management Society of Nigeria .The National Bureau of Statistics told Africa Check it did not have data on waste generated by Nigerians.Waste generation was a “highly variable parameter” affected by factors such as the city and even the seasons, said Dr Chidozie Nnaji, a water resources and environmental engineering researcher at the University of Nigeria , Nsukka.Nnaji said most waste generation studies were localised, and there was a danger in “over-generalising” their results.Claim “Each person [in Nigeria] generates an average of 0.65 kg of waste per day.” Verdict mostly-correctIn its 2018 report, the World Bankestimated thateach person in Nigeria generated an average of 0.5 kilograms of solid waste a day in 2016.The report gave Nigeria’ population as 186 million people in 2016. But the country’s statistics bureauestimatedthe 2016 population at just over 193 million. There's been no official population count since 2006, and those figureswere mired incontroversy.Other sources showed that each person’s average waste generation was close to the claim, analysts told Africa Check.A survey of waste management in Abuja byChibueze Ogwueleka,published in 2013, estimated it at 0.63 kilograms per person.Obiora Ezeudu is an environmental engineer and researcher at thecentre for environmental management and control,University of Nigeria.He told Africa Check that this study “assumed that Abuja has equal representation of all Nigerian entities in terms of culture and ethnicity and socio-economic”. These factors influenced the waste generation rate, Ezeudu said.Dr Thaddeus Nzeadibe, a senior lecturer in the geography department of theUniversity of Nigeria, said Ogwueleka’s rate of 0.63 kilograms per person was a sound estimate.“I don’t seem to have an idea of any other study done on Nigeria’s per capita waste generation,” said Nzeadibe, who has a doctorate in environmental management. “His rate is a clear representation of Nigeria’s per capita waste generation.”But he added that “because it was done in 2013, it is possible the rate would change if the study was done in 2019”.Claim “Lagos has an estimated 21 million inhabitants.” Verdict unprovenIn2016, the National Bureau of Statistics estimated Lagos’s population at12.6 million.But this figure is contested. The Lagos state government’s websitesaysthe population is21 million, the number given in the Guardian’s article.What could explain this difference?Dr Isiaka Olanrewaju isthedata agency’sdirector of household statistics. He told Africa Check that to estimate Nigeria’s 2016 population, the agency used both its own survey and projections from the National Population Commission.But Lagos took a different approach, Olarewaju said.\"The commission based its calculations on who was seen physically during the census, whereas Lagos state based its calculations on those who were usual residents of Lagos state, whether seen or not seen during the period.\"Claim “Lagos has an estimated waste generation of over 15,000 tonnes every day.” Verdict unprovenTheLagos Waste Management Authorityis responsible for the state’s waste collection and disposal.DrOla Oresanyahas headed the agency for more than 10 years. He chose to use a “safe” population figure 20 million, and estimated that an average person in Lagos generated 0.5 kilograms of waste daily.But this “may have increased to 0.6 kilograms because of an increase in affluence and rate of generation”, he told Africa Check. The city produced about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of all forms of waste a day, he estimated.But, again, Lagos’s population is contested, with estimates ranging from 12 million to 21 million. And the World Bank’s2018 reportestimated that only 10% of the city’s waste was collected.We therefore rate the claim as unproven.https://africacheck.org/reports/the-jewel-in-the-crown-lagos-governor-hopefuls-fact-checked/\n",

This photograph of the man in the vehicle is not recent, however, and was digitally altered to change the colour of the vehicle from silver to red. Reuters could not find the original source of the image. However, a reverse image search revealed that the photograph - with the car in silver - has been circulating online since at least 2015 (archive.md/wip/cPJNs). The image is regularly shared by social media users as an internet hoax which surfaces following mass shootings or attacks (here), (archive.md/5S1bi). Users have shared this image of the man in a vehicle, and other images, as a hoax following several incidents since 2015 (archive.md/U9FZ0), (here), (here), (here), (here), (here), (here). “The image in question is a variation of a meme featuring comedian Sam Hyde that originated on 4chan, the online messaging board known for hate, bigotry and conspiracy theories. For years, 4chan users routinely reacted to any mass shooting incident by posting photos of Hyde holding a firearm and claiming he was the gunman, with the hope being that the false claim would deceive journalists, politicians or the public and they would unknowingly promote this claim,” Ciaran O’Connor, analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), told Reuters. “Over time, the meme has moved beyond 4chan and is now, sadly, a common response from some online communities to a shooting or mass casualty incident who regularly post photos of Hyde along with some information linking him to the incident but as claims featuring information or photos of Hyde are always, without fail, false,” he added. At least 5 were killed and over 40 injured after a vehicle drove through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Waukesha Police Department said in a Facebook post on Nov. 22 (here). Waukesha Police Chief, Dan Thompson, earlier told reporters that a person of interest was in custody (here).\n",

            "[Evidences]:A Facebook post shares a meme featuring a picture of American billionaire Jeff Rothschild,  with a quote calling for another world war in order to bring about a 'new world order'. There is no evidence Mr Rothschild has ever said this. The post says: \"In order to finalize the new world order process we need a 3rd world war to exterminate 90% of the global population. This will resolve the problem of human overpopulation. As well as put an end to civil disobedience. \"We will then proceed to automize industry and create a globalized feudalist system in the name of saving our planet\". The quote is attributed to Mr Rothschild during a \"speech given in China\". No specific date or location is given. According to Forbes, Mr Rothschild made his fortune as vice president of infrastructure engineering at Facebook, and as co-founder of Veritas software amongst other business ventures. Forbes estimates he is currently worth $4.8bn. The allegations around this quotation first emerged in 2013 , and have resurfaced at many points over the years. At the time the quotation was first shared, it was accompanied by an image of Mr Rothschild taken at the 2013 North America Chinese Startup and Talent Summit in California (not China), where Mr Rothschild gave a speech about the strategy of starting a small business. The news reports of this summit make no mention of any speech calling for World War Three. Full Fact and other fact checkers have been unable to find any evidence that Mr Rothschild ever said the attributed quote.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A hoax circulating on the Internet claims that President Donald Trump had enough with billionaire liberal George Soros and contacted Russia for a file on him. \"Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order,\" stated a Jan. 30 headline on the Conservative Daily Post. There is no evidence that Trump took any such action against Soros. The same story has been picked up by multiple websites. The Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Soros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him \"a con artist and would-be dictator.\" At a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, \"I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world.\" Soros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his foundations were banned from Austria and false smears, for example that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville. Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a Nazi collaborator. In this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action. That executive order was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security. Soros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a foundation there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in \"Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists,\" the National Post reported in 2015. In 2015, Soros called on the west to inject $50 billion in Ukraine. Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine. \"He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement,\" he said. \"His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine.\" We emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The Las Vegas-based website states that it \"thrives on independent journalism and truth;\" however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence. We found no proof that Trump declared Obama a \"national security threat.\" We rate this story Pants on Fire.\n",

            "[Evidences]:A viral TikTok video falsely claimed to unveil a cover-up from Jan. 6, 2021. The April 19 post showed former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talking on the phone on Jan. 6. Pelosi supposedly says: \"I’ve given a shoot-to-kill order for any breach of the speaker’s lobby.\" The video cuts to a TikTok user who says, \"Well, well, well. What do we have here? Alisha Bobbit? Murdered? Somebody might want to look into this.\" It appears to refer to Ashli Babbit, who was fatally shot while trying to climb through the broken window of a door to the Speaker’s Lobby. Her death has been the subject of many false claims. The TikTok video also includes text that says \"Is this why O’Keefe was fired?\" That appears to refer to James O’Keefe, who founded Project Veritas, an organization known for undercover reporting, using hidden cameras and selectively edited recordings. In February, O’Keefe was forced out after allegations that he mistreated staff and mishandled funds. TikTok identified the video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with TikTok.) But this video isn’t evidence of a cover-up — it’s a deepfake, a manipulated video. Pelosi did not order people to be shot Jan. 6. Other TikTok posts shared longer videos that included the same clip, and those gave the appearance that the deepfake of Pelosi was part of a Project Veritas report. We searched Project Veritas’ videos and found no evidence that the deepfake was part of their videos. The real video of Pelosi came from a documentary by her daughter Alexandra Pelosi that first aired Oct. 13, 2022, on CNN. The conversation the elder Pelosi had on the phone in that clip was with former Vice President Mike Pence about his safety and how to reconvene the electoral count for the presidential election. \"We’re being told it could take days to clear the Capitol and that we should be moving everyone here to get the job done … uh, we’re at (redacted) which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet,\" Pelosi said, according to a CNN transcript. \"We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.\" We rate the claim that this video shows Pelosi giving a shoot-to-kill order on Jan. 6, 2021, Pants on Fire!\n",

            "[Evidences]:Social media users sounded alarms about the Aug. 10 publication of a book about the Maui wildfires that started Aug. 8, baselessly claiming the island may have been intentionally set on fire as part of a conspiracy. \"You guys wanna think that this is all an accident? OK. You wanna think that our government wasn’t involved? OK… But this, this is bugging me,\" a woman said in an Aug. 15 TikTok video. \"How in the actual F did they write and release a book about the fires in Maui?\" Another man in an Aug. 15 Instagram post said, \"Anyone else find this weird? So the Maui fire started on Aug. 8. Yet there’s a book about it already. Even in the description of the book, the book chronicles the events from Aug. 8 to Aug. 11 of 2023, the Maui fires. But the publication of the book was Aug. 10, so how did you chronicle the events of Aug. 11 when the book was published on Aug. 10?\" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The book, titled, \"Fire and Fury: The Story of the 2023 Maui Fire and its Implications for Climate Change,\" was released on Amazon. But the existence of a book that was independently published — by an author whose name appears to be a pseudonym and who includes no identifying details — is not proof that the wildfires were planned. A person using the same pseudonym published at least 15 other books within a three-month period, including one the day after the Maui book was published. Other social media users speculated that the books might have been produced using artificial intelligence, which draws from information already available online. There has been an increase of AI-written e-books on Amazon because tools such as ChatGPT allow users to create books in a matter of hours. Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing service allows authors to publish books on their own, without requiring literary agents or publishing houses. Details in the book’s summary — that the fire was fueled by drought, heat and hurricane winds; experiences of people who lived through the fire; and the efforts of firefighters and rescuers — have been reported by the media and local government. In fact, the summary said that the book draws on \"scientific research, eyewitness accounts, official reports and media coverage,\" all of which are publicly available. The book’s author is identified as \"Dr Miles Stones,\" whose author bio on Amazon reads, \"I’d rather not say.\" The introduction of the \"Fire & Fury,\" which can be viewed on Amazon as a sample, said the fire \"took the lives of six individuals\" and \"decimated over 270 structures.\" Maui County had provided this information in press releases published Aug. 9. According to the Maui Police Department, the death toll has risen to 106 as of Aug. 15. Officials have not identified the cause of wildfires, but dry conditions, low humidity and high winds were factors. Evidence also pointed to power lines as a likely source. PolitiFact has debunked other posts that falsely suggested the fires in Maui were intentionally ignited.

            "claim [Claim]: Says Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn’t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\" Reid continued, \"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\" said Reid. \"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? … You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.\" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, \"I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.\" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. \"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,\" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, \"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.\" Other Republicans leaped to Romney’s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN’s State of the Union that \"I think he’s lying\") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a \"dirty liar\" on ABC’s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni called Reid’s charges part of an \"unbecoming, corrosive game.\" \"Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,\" Bruni wrote. \"Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That’s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.\" Many readers asked us to put Reid’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn’t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney’s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he’s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it’s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it’s safe to assume it’s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney’s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it’s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, \"probably not.\" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it’s \"highly unlikely\" that he paid nothing. \"It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn’t taxed until sold and may never be sold,\" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, \"But Romney’s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It’s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.\" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it’s theoretically possible, it’s also \"preposterous.\" \"Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,\" the article said. \"But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.\" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. \"I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,\" White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"the word is out\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"word\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. Pants on Fire!\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Speaking of Donald Trump's presidency, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger referred to him as the \"one true leader.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Dr. Henry Kissinger, the 95-year-old foreign policy expert who served as a national security adviser and secretary of state under two presidents, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, predicted after the 2016 election that Donald Trump could go down in history as “a very considerable president.” He made the remark during an interview on the CBS public affairs program Face the Nation, during which he also said, according to some sources: Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven’t seen before. Liberals and all those who favored Clinton will never admit it. They will never admit that he is the one true leader. The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation’s people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference. Trump puts America and its people first. That is why people love him and this is why he will remain in charge for a long time. There is not a single thing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes. High praise indeed from the likes of Henry Kissinger — too high, in the judgment of some our readers, in fact, who have been writing to us since this effusive passage first began making the rounds in late 2017 to question its authenticity. The Patriot Post, a right-leaning news and opinion web site, is typical of the sources purveying the quote. “I haven’t always been Henry Kissinger’s biggest fan,” the author of a 20 January 2018 article containing the quote writes, “but I have to credit him with saying several things that seem to mean more when he says them than when I do.” Except that it’s plain from the author’s citation of the supposed source of the quote (another conservative web site called Liberty One News) that most of the words weren’t actually Kissinger’s. Here’s how the passage was presented in that source: Henry Kissinger is an American diplomat and political scientist who served as the United States Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon. He is one of the politicians who really understand politics and cares what people think about. On Sunday he did an interview and said very amazing things regarding President Trump, UConservative reports. He starts with: “Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven’t seen.” Trump is indeed a strange phenomenon. From when he first started to campaign, he was willing to say and do the things all the other candidates were not. Once more Trump managed to survive the things other candidates were not able to. Liberals and all those who favor Clinton will never admit it. They will never admit that he is the one true leader. The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation’s people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference. Kissinger knows it and he continues with: “Every country now has to consider two things. One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities. And secondly, that there is a new president who’s asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it.” Note that the sentences in question fell outside the quotes surrounding Kissinger’s actual statements. In point of fact, they were written (or borrowed) by the author of the piece, not uttered by the former Secretary of State. To confirm this, we hunted down a transcript of Kissinger’s 18 December 2016 appearance on Face the Nation. Although he does say, “Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven’t seen” and could become “a very considerable president,” Kissinger doesn’t say, “They [Clinton supporters] will never admit that he is the one true leader,” nor does he say, “There is not a single thing wrong with him.” Nor have we been able to find these words attributed to Kissinger in any other reliable source. Here is a video clip of the full Face the Nation interview: We researched a variant of this claim in 2020.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces a competitive reelection bid in New Hampshire and Democrats are already taking aim at her record on abortion and women’s health. Gov. Maggie Hassan, the only Democratic candidate in the race, is one of the latest to lob those criticisms. \"She has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides healthcare to about 12,000 Granite State women,\" Hassan said in a recent interview with the Concord Monitor, referring to Ayotte. \"She’s voted to defund them six times.\" Planned Parenthood, a women’s health care provider that also offers abortions, has become a lightning rod in recent years as elected officials in Washington and in New Hampshire have taken steps to cut the organization’s funding. The organization is no fan of Ayotte: Planned Parenthood’s political arm took out its first ad of the 2016 cycle this month targeting New Hampshire’s junior Senator. We decided to take a closer look at Hassan’s claim. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England runs five health centers across New Hampshire -- in Manchester, Claremont, Derry, Exeter and Keene. And roughly half of the patients who visit a Planned Parenthood clinic across the border in Vermont -- in White River Junction -- are from New Hampshire. The Planned Parenthood centers in New Hampshire all provide contraception, annual exams, STI testing and treatment, and pregnancy testing. The Manchester location, which saw 4,779 patients in 2014, provides surgical and medical abortions. The Keene location, visited by 1,871 patients in 2014, offers medication abortions, according to Kayla McCarthy, with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Altogether Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire served just over 11,000 patients during 2014, according according to Vice President for Public Policy Jennifer Frizzell. Another 1,750 were seen in the White River Junction, VT clinic. That would mean Planned Parenthood clinics together saw roughly 12,000 New Hampshire patients in 2014, in line with Hassan’s claim. Now let’s look at how many times Ayotte has voted against Planned Parenthood funding. Ayotte, elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, has been a consistent opponent of abortion and critic of Planned Parenthood. We checked with Hassan’s campaign and they pointed us to six votes. Three votes took place all on the same day, Dec. 3, 2015. 1) That day the Senate voted 52-47 to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in one bill. Ayotte voted for it. 2) Ayotte voted against an amendment that would have stripped a provision from the bill to defund Planned Parenthood. (The amendment was defeated.) 3) Another amendment, proposed by Democrats, sought to continue federal funding for Planned Parenthood, but it was tabled (that is, set aside) and Ayotte voted in favor of tabling it. (President Obama ultimately vetoed the bill.) 4) Ayotte voted to advance a bill last August that sought to prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the legislation failed to get the 60 votes it needed to move forward. 5) Ayotte voted in April 2011 for a resolution to prohibit federal dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. It failed, 42 to 58. 6) And in March 2011 Ayotte voted for a bill to fund the federal government, that included dozens of other spending items, but blocked federal funding to Planned Parenthood. The bill failed, 44 to 56. Ayotte said at the time: \"Our country is in a fiscal crisis… Everyone is going to have to make sacrifices, including many private organizations that have relied on federal resources,\" according to her office. In all, these six votes show some level opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood. However, some of them were procedural, and not all offered a clean up-or-down funding decision, as Hassan’s statement suggests. Ayotte’s office said she supported several other government spending bills that did not defund Planned Parenthood. And in September 2015, Ayotte voted not to move forward with a temporary government spending bill that sought to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte said at the time she supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but didn’t want to shut the government down to do it. \"Kelly Ayotte has voted to direct federal funding away from Planned Parenthood in an effort to better use federal dollars to fill gaps in women's health services for low-income women and preserve access to women’s health services,\" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said. Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted six times to defund Planned Parenthood. Ayotte has been a consistent critic of Planned Parenthood and has shown support for defunding the organization or opposition to continued funding in at least six votes. It’s worth noting that some were procedural votes and several were much larger bills that included a provision on Planned Parenthood funding. Hassan’s claim is accurate, but needs clarification. We rate her statement Mostly True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says a young Texas rapper charged with capital crimes faces the death penalty but the alleged Santa Fe High School shooter faces prison and then parole after 40 years.\n",
            "[Evidences]:A U.S. Supreme Court ruling keeps the admitted shooter in a Santa Fe, Texas, school from facing the death penalty. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, would have had to be 18 to qualify. Still, a meme brought to our attention by readers suggests he's getting a special lift up. The meme shows an African-American 17-year-old Texas rapper, Taymore \"Tay-K 47\" McIntyre, and says that he faces the death penalty if convicted of capital charges pending against him. Meantime, the meme says, Pagourtzis--who admitted to the May 18, 2018, mass shooting at Santa Fe High School that killed 10 and wounded at least 10 others, according to court documents--faces no death penalty plus \"parole in 40 years.\" Rapper T.I. recently shared the meme on his Instagram, saying, \"So the question is how is the D.A. seeking the death penalty for Tay K & not the other guy?\" T.I. went on to note that McIntyre is a minor, like Pagourtzis. They’re \"the same age!!!!!!,\" T.I. wrote. According to a May 10, 2018, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story, McIntyre has been charged in two capital murders — one in Mansfield and one in San Antonio — as well as in an aggravated robbery that left an Arlington, Texas, man seriously injured. The story said he remained in jail. After the Santa Fe shootings, the Houston Chronicle, a Houston TV station and the Star-Telegram each declared that the disparity for capital crime convictions suggested by the meme lacks factual footing because of the 2005 Supreme Court ruling. To get our fix on the meme’s accuracy, we turned first to the court decision. Supreme Court acts On March 1, 2005, the court held by 5-4 that the Constitution’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment means the death penalty could no longer be imposed on juvenile offenders under 18. The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" The ruling, in Roper vs. Simmons, stemmed in part, the majority wrote, from 30 states already prohibiting the juvenile death penalty. The ruling removed 72 people from death rows in a dozen states, according to a March 2005 news story in the New York Times, and \"represented an about-face for a court that only 16 years ago rejected the argument that the execution of those who kill at the age of 16 or 17 violated\" the constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishments. By phone, Sarah Guidry, who directs the Earl Call Institute for Legal and Social Policy at Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law, said that after the high court acted, Texas lawmakers amended state law. Section 8.07(c) of the state’s penal code states: \"No person may, in any case, be punished by death for an offense committed while the person was younger than 18 years.\" Before the Supreme Court ruled, Texas was among 12 states with juveniles on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that compiles information and statistics about the death penalty. From 1976 until the court acted, the center says, 22 defendants were executed for crimes committed as juveniles. By phone, the center’s Robert Dunham told us 13 of the death penalties were carried out in Texas. Dunham, calling the meme false, said the Roper ruling left no room for states to sentence to death any individuals younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. By phone, Texas state senators versed in criminal justice told us the court’s ruling in Roper means no juvenile can be sentenced to death. Sen. Juan \"Chuy\" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the ruling \"changed the lay of the land when it came to the death penalty and juveniles.\" Parole in 40 years? Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, vice chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, said state law otherwise backs up the meme’s indication that Pagourtzis could be imprisoned yet paroled after 40 years. That's so, she said,thanks to legislative action in the wake of a June 2012 Supreme Court ruling. The majority opinion in Miller v. Alabamastates: \"By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\" In 2013, Texas lawmakers reacted to the ruling by passinginto law a measure mandating that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. Previously, juveniles 17 to 18 convicted of capital offenses faced life-without-parole sentences. We asked Dunham to speak to the parole part of the meme. He cautioned that Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years; the lawdoesn’t say anyone automatically gets paroled. Summing up, Dunham said: \"If you are age 17, the most you can get for capital murder in Texas is life with the possibility of parole after 40 years.\" Our ruling A meme suggests a Texas rapper charged with capital offenses faces the death penalty while the alleged shooter in the Santa Fe school faces prison only and then parole after 40 years -- even though both are 17. That disparity isn’t backed up by state laws which, in compliance with Supreme Court rulings, potentially subject both the rapper and the alleged school shooter to sentences of life in prison with parole possible after 40 years. U.S. juveniles haven’t been subject to death sentences since the high court ruled out that prospect in 2005. We rate this meme False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

            "claim [Claim]: Says \"Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The Oregon House voted recently to designate brewer’s yeast as the state microbe. House Concurrent Resolution 12, which honors Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is now in the hands of the Senate after receiving unanimous support in the House. Before it passed, resolution sponsor Rep. Mark Johnson, R-Hood River, hammered home the economic importance of craft breweries to Oregon. \"Designating Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer’s yeast, as the official microbe of the state of Oregon is an important recognition of the impact this little microbe has had on our state’s economy and on our culture,\" Johnson said. \"Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers.\" All that craft brewery talk made PolitiFact Oregon feel rather parched. Had Johnson just mapped out a summer road trip for us to quench our thirst (for knowledge of Oregon political geography, of course)? Is there really at least one craft brewery in every legislative district in the state? Johnson’s office provided us with a list of breweries by Senate and House district. Every Senate district contains two House districts; we wanted to ensure at least one craft brewing facility exists in each of the 60 House districts. Johnson’s legislative aide, Rainier Butler, said it appeared that every district contained a craft brewery except House District 17, which covers Stayton, Lebanon and Scio. To double check Johnson’s data, we visited the Oregon Liquor Control Commission website and downloaded a spreadsheet of the more than 15,000 alcohol licenses issued by the state. We narrowed the list to the 222 facilities that had active brewery and brewery-public house licenses. These are facilities that make malt beverages and then sell them primarily at wholesale or retail. Mark Friesen, an online producer at The Oregonian, geocoded and mapped the 222 facilities by legislative district. The results confirmed that House District 17 lacks a licensed brewery, as does House District 47, which covers a large portion of East Portland, and House District 4, which covers Central Point, White City and Eagle Point. We checked with the offices of Rep. Dennis Richardson, a Central Point Republican who represents District 4; Rep. Sherrie Sprenger, a Scio Republican who represents District 17; and Jessica Vega Pederson, a Portland Democrat who represents District 47, to see if they knew of any craft brewing facilities in their districts. They did not, though their staff said it was not the type of information they kept close tabs on. We should also note that businesses constantly open and close, so perhaps a craft brewery in those districts recently closed unbeknownst to us or is slated to open soon. However, our map of OLCC licensed breweries also indicated that two more districts — 28 in Beaverton and Aloha, and 40 in Oregon City and Gladstone — lack craft breweries. Johnson’s office said those districts include a branch of McMenamins, which they believe count as craft breweries even if they don’t brew their own beer on site. We’re not sure we buy that. If they don’t brew their own beer on site, they’re just like any other bar serving beer brewed elsewhere. McMenamins does have one pub in each of those two districts, but company spokeswoman Renee Rank confirmed for us that the Beaverton and Oregon City pubs do not brew beer on site. The beer is brought in from other nearby breweries, she said. Lastly, we shared our findings with Brian Butenschoen, executive director of the Oregon Brewers Guild, which represents 103 brewing companies. He couldn’t think of any craft breweries in House Districts 4, 17 or 47, though all the other districts have at least one. \"It’s pretty close, but I don’t think every single one does,\" he said. We asked him if a McMenamins pub that served beer brewed off-site would count in his book as a craft brewery. \"It’s not a super-important distinction to most folks,\" he said. \"Would I count that in my list of breweries? No.\" Our investigation found that districts 4, 17 and 47 do not have craft breweries. We’re also skeptical that a McMenamins pub that doesn’t brew on site qualifies as a craft brewery. \"The vast majority of Oregon does have access to quality craft brewery products,\" Johnson said after we shared our findings. \"The craft-brewing industry is incredibly fast growing. It continues to be a bright spot in the midst of an otherwise slow economy.\" Even if we exclude the two districts with McMenamins pubs, more than 90 percent of House and Senate districts in Oregon have at least one craft brewery. If Johnson had hedged his statement a bit and said that \"nearly\" every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery, this would be a True. But that’s not what he said. Johnson said in his floor speech that every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery. We rate this statement False — and hope to see you out on the beer trail soon to toast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: During an interview broadcast on March 16, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden said \"don't come\" to migrants considering trips to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum in America.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In spring 2021, leaders of U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration scrambled for solutions to an increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.Meanwhile, rumors circulated about the new president’s message to those people. Specifically, social media posts, like the one displayed below, claimed Biden urged migrants to avoid making the trip to southern border crossings altogether. The claim was true at face value, though it lacked necessary context to fully comprehend why Biden made the statement. During an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that broadcast on March 16, the president indeed said “don’t come” to migrants considering the trip due to the bottleneck of people currently waiting at border patrol facilities (in part because the COVID-19 pandemic) and the new administration’s proposed plans to reform the asylum-seeking process. Before we analyze that media appearance, let this be clear: The numbers of both unaccompanied children and families seeking asylum and waiting for court hearings at the southern border in spring 2021, under Biden, were lower than they were at various points during the Trump administration, according to The Associated Press. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, compiled by The Washington Post, found an annual seasonal bump of migrants at the border during cooler months. Now, let’s focus on Biden’s comments during the ABC interview. According to a transcript and video recording of the media appearance, the latter of which we obtained via ABC’s website, the president said border officials were indeed instructed to send adult migrants back to their home countries — denying them access to the U.S. — and attempting to connect unaccompanied children with social services. Simultaneously, he said his administration was trying to establish a new system for people to register for asylum, though he did not provide specifics or an exact timeline for when those changes would take effect. (Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas elaborated on the efforts in an interview with NPR about one month earlier, saying nongovernmental organizations were preparing to identify applicants for asylum based on the severity of their situations and then allow them to register for the status via “electronic portals.”) Then, Stephanopoulos and Biden had the following exchange: Stephanopoulos: It’s going to take some time though to get those policies in place again. Do you have to say quite clearly, ‘Don’t come’? Biden: Yes. I can say quite clearly, “Don’t come.” What we’re in the process of getting set up, and it’s not going to take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don’t leave your town or city or community. We’re going to make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run by [Department of Homeland Security] and also access with HHS, the Health and Human Services, to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now. Make your case. We’ll have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That’s the best way to do this. In other words, while Biden indeed cautioned people against making the trip to border crossings in March 2021, his comments implied that he would take a different stance in the future when his administration completed its rollout of changes to the country’s asylum-seeking process. Days after that interview, the U.S. Embassy to Haiti used its official Twitter account to highlight several of Biden’s quotes during the ABC interview — such as, “I can say quite clearly, don’t come over” — in both English and Haitian Creole. Considering that evidence, specifically the video interview of Biden with Stephanopoulos, we rate this claim “True.” It was not the first — nor the last — instance of a member of the Biden administration or the president himself cautioning migrants against making the trip to U.S.-Mexico border crossings. During his Feb. 12 interview with NPR, for example, Mayorkas said of people attempting to flee Honduras, Guatemala, or neighboring countries: “It’s a very, very important cautionary note that they should not travel to the border.”\n",

            "[Evidences]:On 15 June 2018, Incredibles 2— the sequel to the hugely successful 2004 animated movie Incredibles— was released to good reviews. Not long after that, the reviews were augmented by concerns in widely shared blog posts and social media warningsthat certain scenes might trigger epileptic seizures. On 16 June, the non-profit Epilepsy Foundation issued a warning about the film: Members of our community have expressed concerns about flashing lights in the new Disney Pixar movie “Incredibles 2,” and, in certain instances, people having experienced a seizure during the movie. We stand with our epilepsy warriors and their families as they voice their concerns about the movie and appreciate the efforts some theaters have already made to post warning signs for people waiting to see the movie. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, around three percent of people with epilepsy have a condition known as photosensitive epilepsy, in which intense flickering lights and other visual stimuli can trigger seizures, migraines, and headaches. Among the common causes of these seizures are “intense strobe lights,” “video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors,” and even natural sunlight, “especially when shimmering off water, flickering through trees or through the slats of Venetian blinds.” Over the course of the movie’s opening weekend, members of the public shared photographs of a boilerplate warning posted in movie theaters in various parts of the country by various companies including AMC and Cinemark: So I went to see The Incredibles 2 and I saw this sign outside the theatre.

Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that you provide at the box office and other appropriate places a notice to your customers containing the following information: “INCREDIBLES 2 contains a sequence of flashing lights which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities.” Bring the kids!

            "[Evidences]:Gift Article Share “Issa wouldn’t protect us from a bill that raises premiums and causes 24 million to lose their insurance.” — new “Save My Care” ad attacking Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) Seven vulnerable Republican lawmakers are being targeted with $1 million in television spots by a liberal group backed by labor and progressive interests. The ads generally focus on the lawmakers’ apparent support for the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the failed House bill that was designed to replace the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. The ad tries to capitalize on the interesting shift in public sentiment about Obamacare, suddenly more popular as it has come under legislative assault by the Trump administration. Let’s walk through the claims in the ad aimed at Issa. As attack ads go, this one is relatively careful about its language. Advertisement “Congressman Issa promised to protect our health care. But when right-wing politicians tried to pass a disastrous health-care repeal bill that raises costs and cuts coverage, Issa wouldn’t oppose them…” We’ll get into the specifics about raising costs and cutting coverage below. But whether Issa “wouldn’t oppose” the health-care replacement backed by President Trump is a matter of dispute. Save My Care pointed to a variety of news articles in which Issa indicated that changes made in the bill to attract votes had swung him toward a “yes” position. The right-leaning American Action Network even ran an ad thanking Issa even though a vote never took place. But Calvin Moore, Issa’s communications director, said Issa never supported the bill: “The congressman said that the bill wasn’t ‘in a form that I can approve of,’ then followed it up later on Fox News, telling the network that he’s ‘not prepared to vote for it as is right now.’” He said that Issa raised concerns that the bill wouldn’t do enough for mental health, that it could leave many — particularly those nearing retirement — worse off, and that it didn’t do enough to expand the risk pools to help curb some of the premium increases in Obamacare. Issa has proposed to open the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) to all Americans. Moore said the AHCA had been improved, which is why Issa said he was leaning toward a yes, but it still had not won Issa’s support when it was pulled from a vote. He noted that after the bill was pulled, Issa issued a statement calling the bill “imperfect” and said lawmakers need to get “back to the drawing board.” Advertisement In the end, Issa never pledged his support for the bill. One presumes that’s why the ad says he did not oppose it, which is technically correct. “… Issa wouldn’t protect us from a bill that raises premiums and causes 24 million to lose their insurance…” We’ve criticized Democrats for seizing on a Congressional Budget Office report to claim that the bill would “throw 24 million people off health insurance,” “take away health care for 24 million,” or make 24 million “lose their insurance.” Here, the ad more conservatively says “causes 24 million to lose their insurance.” But it still could be confusing to ordinary people. The CBO projected the impact of the AHCA compared to existing law, and concluded that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance by 2026. As the CBO put it, “the increase in the number of uninsured people relative to the number under current law would rise to 21 million in 2020 and then to 24 million in 2026.” But that does not mean that all of those people involuntarily lost their insurance, as the ad suggests. Advertisement Initially, CBO said, many of the people who would be uninsured would choose not to have insurance because they had decided to obtain health insurance only to avoid a penalty under the ACA’s individual mandate; the replacement bill eliminated the mandate. Others, such as elderly Americans, would not get insurance because the premiums would become higher for the elderly. But by 2026, 14 million of the uninsured people would lose insurance because of reductions in Medicaid enrollment — after some states discontinue the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. By 2026, 7 million fewer people also would have health insurance through their employers, CBO estimated. As for raising premiums, again the CBO projected the impact versus current law. Premiums would initially be higher, but by 2026 premiums would be about 10 percent lower. (This does not mean that premiums would decline by 10 percent, just that they would increase at a lower rate than now projected.) But the reasons for the decrease were not necessarily favorable for the proposed law. That’s because insurance premiums would spike for older people (20 to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old) and many older people would drop out of the insurance markets. Then the pool of people getting insurance would be younger and healthier, leading to lower premiums than currently projected. The Brookings Institution, in an effort to come up with an apples-to-apples comparison, estimated that premiums under the proposed law would actually be 13 percent higher if adjusted for coverage and age. Advertisement Save My Care pointed to the Brookings study to justify the phrasing on “raising premiums.” Given that the premiums were projected to decrease mainly because older people were being priced out of the market, the language in the ad about premiums is acceptable. “… wouldn’t oppose a massive ‘age tax’ on people over 50…” “Age tax” is a phrase coined by AARP, the old-age interest group, to refer to the fact that proposed law would have changed the Obamacare requirement that older people could pay no more than three times a young person. Under the AHCA, the 3:1 ratio would have become 5:1. The result, as noted above, would have meant premiums would have dropped for younger Americans, relative to current law, but increased sharply for older Americans. So it’s not really a tax, but an increase in health-care premiums. “… and isn’t fighting to protect coverage for preexisting conditions.” One of the most popular features of the ACA is its ban on insurance companies considering preexisting conditions. But conservative Republicans have pushed for changes that experts say could undermine that aspect of the law, such as allowing states to opt out of a requirement to provide certain benefits and charge the same price to everyone the same age. Save My Care says this line is based on the fact that Issa has not stated a position on these proposals. The bill was amended just before Congress went on recess, but the amendment did not include the broader changes sought by conservatives. Advertisement Moore noted that the AHCA contained protections for preexisting conditions, as does Issa’s own health-care proposal. “Preexisting conditions coverage is a part of his FEHBP-based bill which he said should be part of the conversation when we ‘go back to the drawing board,'” he said. The Pinocchio Test The ad is carefully worded, apparently in an effort to avoid becoming fact-checker bait. We noted our concern about the phrasing concerning the 24 million losing insurance, but even that did not push the envelope as much as many Democrats have in the past. The ad also leaps to a conclusion that Issa “isn’t fighting” to provide coverage for preexisting conditions, when he has indeed been a supporter of that aspect of Obamacare. Also missing, of course, is any notion that there are serious problems with the Affordable Care Act, including higher premiums and shrinking insurance options, that Congress at some point needs to tackle. Issa certainly has been a critic of Obamacare, but unlike the suggestion in this ad, he never fully embraced the House Republican bill either. Readers should always be wary of the claims made in 30-second attack ads, as the truth often is much more complex.

            "[Evidences]:Helen Zille, the leader of South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance, says her party has the \"best story to tell\" ahead of the 2014 general elections. Beginning of March 2014, the DA launched a campaign that drew heavily on its performance in the Western Cape, the only one of South Africa's nine provinces that is not held by the governing African National Congress. The DA maintains that the \"Western Cape Story\" highlights the \"great strides made in the province since 2009\" and \"really is a good story to tell\" , one that could become \"South Africa's story\" if the party comes to power. In a video released on 7 March 2014, the DA set out many of the claims that are key to the \"Western Cape Story\". Africa Check investigated them. This report forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on 7 May. Claim \"In the ANC's last year in government, not one department received a clean audit. In the DA's first year, seven departments received clean audits.\" Verdict correct In 2008/09 - the last year the ANC governed the Western Cape - the Auditor-General reported that not a single provincial government department had received a clean audit. In 2009/10 - the first year the Western Cape was run by the DA - the Auditor-General reported that seven departments had received clean audits. Claim \"The country's top three government departments since 2011 have all been in the Western Cape.\" Verdict correct Western Cape provincial government departments have occupied the top spots in the Annual Public Sector Reporting Awards since 2011. Both the 2011 and 2012 awards placed Western Cape departments in the top three positions. The Western Cape Department of Agriculture has scooped the top spot for two years running. Claim \"Under the ANC, not one department featured in the top three.\" Verdict incorrect Under the ANC, the Western Cape agriculture department and the treasury were placed second and third respectively in the 2007 Annual Public Sector Reporting Awards. The Western Cape Department of Local Government was placed second in the 2006 awards. Claim \"The Western Cape was ranked as the best run province in South Africa in 2013.\" Verdict correct The DA referred Africa Check to an assessment produced by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency which evaluated \"the quality of management practices across a comprehensive range of management areas, from supply chain management to strategic planning\". The assessment found that the Western Cape government scored highest out of all the provinces for strategic management, governance and accountability, human resources management and financial management. Claim \"The [Western Cape] was also the only province with no irregular or unauthorised spending.\" Verdict unproven The claim that the Western Cape was the only province in South Africa with \"no irregular or unauthorised spending\" in 2013 cannot be assessed as the Auditor-General's 2013/14 audit has yet to be finalised. Africa Check asked the DA what evidence it had to support the claim. To date the party has not responded. We will update this report if they do. Claim \"The Western Cape now has the highest access to water, flush toilets and electricity in the country.\" Verdict correct The 2011 national census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water. The Western Cape had the highest percentage of households with access to flush or chemical toilets at 92% . It was followed by Gauteng, where 86.5% of households had access to flush or chemical toilets. According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng. However, the claim does not acknowledge the already high level of delivery that the DA inherited when it wrested control of the province from the ANC in 2009. Claim \"The [Western Cape] also has the highest proportion of households receiving free basic water, free basic electricity and free basic sewerage and sanitation.\" Verdict correct The claim is correct, according to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA). In 2012 , 66.4% of Western Cape \"consumer units\" received free basic water. Nationally, only 37.1% of \"consumer units\" received free basic water. The Western Cape provided free basic electricity to 43.6% of \"consumer units\" in 2012. This was the highest in the country. Nationally, only 24.9% of \"consumer units\" received free basic electricity. While only 25.7% of \"consumer units\" in South Africa received free basic sewerage and sanitation, 67.7% of \"consumer units\" in the Western Cape received this free basic service, according to Stats SA. Claim \"In 2009, the ANC left the province with over 6,000 health department vacancies. The vacancy rate for nurses was 34%. By 2013, the DA had brought this down to just 1%.\" Verdict unproven This claim could not be independently verified. According to the Western Cape Department of Health's 2008/09 annual report ,  27,198 of 36,380 posts were filled, with 9,193 vacancies. Funding had not been provided for 8,549 of the vacancies and the annual report stated that their inclusion incorrectly \"inflated the vacancy rate\". The 2012/13 annual report stated that out of 31,733 posts, 30,345 were occupied and 1,388 were vacant. However, only vacancies for posts that had been funded were listed. The Western Cape Department of Health told Africa Check that there were no unfunded vacancies that year. If you compare the number of funded vacancies between the two years it appears that they have increased from 644 in 2009 to 1,388 in 2013. Cameron Arendse, Zille's spokesman in her capacity as party leader, told Africa Check that the claim that nursing vacancies stood at 34% in 2009 was sourced from the South African Institute of Race Relations' 2012 South Africa Survey . However, the survey attributes this vacancy rate to 2010, not 2009. The figure also exclude nursing assistants and student nurses. The Western Cape Department of Health's 2013/14 annual report – which could potentially verify the accuracy of the claim that the vacancy rate has dropped to 1% - has yet to be released. The DA referred us to two other supporting documents. Both are speeches, not primary sources. The first was a February 2014 address by the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, in which he claimed that the vacancy rate of permanent nurses had been brought down to less than 1%. The second was an October 2013 speech made by the Western Cape's minister of health, Theuns Botha. It stated that the vacancy rate had decreased to 5%. Neither claim could be independently verified. According to the department's latest annual report , vacancy rates stood at 3.68% for professional nurses, 2.95% for enrolled nurses and 2.47% for enrolling nursing auxiliaries. The DA's reasoning for citing speeches by its political leaders as primary sources was explained as follows by David Christianson, the party's senior research consultant: \"When DA [provincial ministers],  or the premier of the Western Cape, make factual claims, we (the party) believe them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary… As a result, in a party political state such as this, factual statements by DA MECs are given as sources.\" Claim \"The DA has increased ARV treatment in the Western Cape from 14,000 to 132,000.\" Verdict incorrect Questioned about the sourcing of the claim, the DA referred us to an article published by the South African Government News Agency in February last year which stated that the Western Cape had \"increased anti-retroviral treatment provision from 14,370 to 132,279\". The article did not provide a source for the data. But the Western Cape health department's annual reports contradict the claim. In 2008/09 , the last year the ANC held power in the Western Cape, anti-retroviral treatment was provided to 54,703 patients. In 2009/10 , the first year the DA was in office in the Western Cape, anti-retroviral treatment was provided to 75,002 patients. The 2012/13 annual report supports the DA's claim that treatment has increased to 132,000 patients. The annual report states that 134,212 patients were on anti-retroviral therapy in that year. Claim \"[The DA] has brought down the rate of mother to child HIV transmission to just 1.8%, the lowest in the country.\" Verdict correct The claim that the Western Cape has the lowest rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission in the country is correct, according to a 2011 study by the Medical Research Council. It found that the Western Cape had the lowest rate of mother-to-child transmission at 1.98%. The Northern Cape had the highest, at 6.06%, and the national average was 2.67%. Claim \"In its first term in office, the DA built three brand new hospitals in Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain and George and currently has 75 health care projects valued at R4.5 billion underway.\" Verdict exaggerated The claim is slightly exaggerated. The Khayelitsha Hospital opened in April 2012 and the Mitchells Plain Hospital opened in November 2013. However, a new hospital wasn't built in George. A new emergency unit was added to an existing hospital in July 2012. The Western Cape's 2014-2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement states that over the next three years approximately R3 billion will be invested in health infrastructure. Claim \"While the broad unemployment rate in South Africa is a staggering 34%, the Western Cape has a broad unemployment rate of 22%.\" Verdict correct The last Quarterly Labour Force Survey of 2014 indicates that South Africa's broad unemployment rate stood at 34% in the fourth quarter, compared to 22.1% in the Western Cape. Broad unemployment stood at 43.3% in the Eastern Cape and 42.2% in the Free State. Claim \"Since the end of 2012, South Africa's unemployed population has grown by 121,000. In the Western Cape the unemployed population has shrunk by 48,000.\" Verdict correct Stats SA's latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey shows that the number of people in South Africa who are unemployed increased by 121,000 between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013. Unemployment figures in the Western Cape fell from 641,000 at the end of 2012 to 593,000 at the end of 2013. Note: South Africa's official employment data has not been without controversy and economists and the country's Reserve Bank have reportedly expressed scepticism about Stats SA's numbers . Claim \"Under-performing schools are schools where the matric pass rate is less than 60%. Under the ANC this went from 36 schools in 2006 to 85 in 2009. In just four years the DA brought the number of underperforming schools down to 23.\" Verdict mostly-correct According to data compiled by the national Department of Basic Education, there were 34 under-performing schools in 2006, 84 in 2009 and 23 in 2013. Claim \"Since 2009 there has been a 25% increase in the number of candidates from poorer schools to pass the National Senior Certificate exams. In Khayelitsha alone, the number of passes has gone up by almost 1,000 since 2009.\" Verdict mostly-correct The Western Cape Department of Education told Africa Check that the claim refers to quintiles one, two and three schools. The quintile system gives a ranking to schools according to poverty levels. \"Quintile one\" schools are considered the most poor while \"quintile five\" schools are the least poor. In a January 2013 press release, Western Cape education minister Donald Grant said the number of passes in quintile one to three schools had increased from 7,798 in 2009 to 9,797 in 2012 - a 25% increase. Data compiled by the national Department of Basic Education shows that 9,131 pupils passed in 2012, not 9,797 as claimed by the DA. However, Dr Rufus Poliah, chief director of national examinations and assessments in the Department of Basic Education, told Africa Check that the figures reported by the Western Cape Department of Education would be more accurate than the national department's data. \"It is their schools and they work more closely with them,\" he said. The number of pupils in quintile one to three schools in the Western Cape that passed the National Senior Certificate exams in 2009 could not be verified. The national department does not have updated quintile information prior to 2012. But other data from the basic education department does show that in 2009, 1,343 pupils passed matric in Khayelitsha schools. In 2013, this increased by 833 to 2,176 passes. Claim \"Under the DA, the matric science pass rate went from 53% to 73%. The maths pass rate went from 65% to 73%.\" Verdict correct Department of Basic Education data confirms that the DA's claim is correct. The physical science pass rate improved from 53% in 2009 to 72.6% in 2013 and the mathematics pass rate increased from 65% to 73.3%.

            "claim [Claim]: Says two-thirds of groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Amid fallout from the IRS’s admission that it improperly targeted conservative groups, Democratic-leaning Progress Texas suggested the agency’s net was cast wider, tweeting that \"2/3 of groups scrutinized were not conservatives.\" That May 31, 2013, statement wasn’t the first time the nonprofit advocacy group made such a claim; a May 17 post on its website said, \"Two-thirds of those groups that received extra scrutiny from the IRS were not conservative.\" Context: The IRS apologized May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included \"tea party,\" \"patriot\" or \"9/12.\" The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. Since then, groups of varied political stripes including Progress Texas have spoken up to say their own applications drew extra scrutiny. We asked how Progress Texas concluded that most of the groups were not conservative. Political director Phillip Martin told us by email that the statement was based on a May 12, 2013, Washington Post news story about a leaked report from the U.S. Treasury inspector general that the government released two days later. The Post story said that according to the report, \"Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny ... 72 had ‘tea party’ in their title, 13 had ‘patriot’ and 11 had ‘9/12.’ \" That equaled 96 groups, Martin said, or 32.2 percent of the declared 298. Were the other 202 groups nonconservative? Neither the report nor the story described those groups, and Progress Texas did not reply to our follow-up requests for relevant information. The IRS said in a May 15, 2013, press release that the groups without \"tea party\" in their names \"included organizations of all political views.\" Precisely what happened from May 2010 through May 2012 at the agency’s Cincinnati, Ohio, office, where all such tax-exemption applications are processed, has not become clear. But according to the inspector general’s report, IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants’ political views and activities, including some broad descriptions but also others aimed at conservatives. For instance, the report says staffers were asked to flag groups educating Americans about the Constitution, which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. According to the report, the IRS criteria included: In U.S. House hearings May 17 and 22, 2013, lawmakers questioned acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller and the Treasury’s inspector general, J. Russell George, about the 202 unlabeled groups. On May 22, Miller said that \"202 non-Tea Party cases... were reviewed for indications of significant political campaign intervention, which was our key criteria,\" helping to determine whether a group’s activities affected its eligibility for the 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) designations. \"We did not evaluate whether or not they were conservative groups, or -- or progressive groups, or liberal groups, or whatever term you want to use,\" Miller said. Asked May 17 whether liberal buzz words such as \"progressive\" or \"organizing\" also were used to identify groups for scrutiny, Miller said they were not. IRS employees, Miller said May 17, were grouping similar applications together for efficiency. The method they used, he said, \"while intolerable, was a mistake and not an act of partisanship.\" George said his report did not break out the political makeup of the 202 groups because it looked only at the names of the organizations: \"Certain names were so generic that we were unable to determine whether or not they had a particular point of view.\" A full breakdown of the scrutinized groups, or even types of groups, might not surface. On May 20, 2013, Senate Finance Committee leaders asked the IRS for information including the names of the 298 targeted groups; they had not received the names as of June 6, 2013, committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless told us via email. Our ruling Progress Texas has twice said that two-thirds of the groups whose applications for tax-exempt status were scrutinized by the IRS were not conservative. The group’s fraction appears to be an unsupported assumption tied to a government report saying that 96 of 298 IRS-scrutinized organizations, or about a third, had \"tea party,\" \"patriot\" or \"9/12\" in their names. The report listed other criteria the IRS used, some of which appeared to be aimed at conservatives. But the report has no information on the political makeup of the other groups, and we see no other indications that their political leanings have been authoritatively summed up or individually revealed, though the IRS has said the scrutinized groups without \"tea party\" in their names reflected \"all political views,\" which presumably would fold in liberals to moderates to conservatives. Progress Texas’ claim shakes out as incorrect and, given the lack of backup documentation, ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n",

            "claim [Claim]: California Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed \"diverting 30 percent of the funding\" from the state’s gas tax increase \"to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Drivers in California will start paying a higher gas tax this fall, as part of a bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown to raise money for the state’s deteriorating roads and bridges. But when that tax hike kicks in, how much revenue will go to road projects? Republican State Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez claimed in a press release and on Twitter on May 11, 2017 that a large chunk will be siphoned off for anything but roads. \"Governor Brown and his fellow Democrats are already diverting funding to their own pet projects,\" she said in the press release. \"In this budget proposal, they are diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons. That’s money from the very gas tax the Democrats promised would go solely to fixing our decrepit roads and providing relief for traffic congestion.\" The gas tax increase is part of a larger transportation funding legislation signed by Brown in April 2017. In common speech, some politicians simply call this \"the gas tax.\" It includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase that starts in November; a diesel tax hike; and a new \"transportation improvement fee\" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one’s vehicle. We wrote about how this new tax will affect the state's already high gas tax rate hereand gas prices here. It passed the Legislature with the help of Democrats and one Republican state senator. Melendez, who represents Riverside County, strongly opposed it. There’s no doubt roads are the main focus of the funding package. The measure was even called The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. We decided to examine two key parts of Melendez’s claim: Did Brown’s budget ‘divert’ 30 percent of the transportation funding? And was this money being siphoned off for ‘non-road’ related projects? We buckled up for a fact check. Our research Melendez’s spokesman Sam Spencer showed us a chart in the governor’s revised May budget that he said backs up the claim. It shows proposals for spending $2.8 billion of the new transportation revenue in the next fiscal year on various programs. Local streets and roads would get $445 million; bridges and culverts would receive $400 million and congested corridors would get $250 million. Spencer highlighted other categories he said \"are clearly not programs intended to fix our crumbling roads.\" Those, Spencer said, include rail, transit, active transportation such as bikeways and pedestrian paths, parks and recreation, food and agriculture, university research and workforce development programs. Brown’s budget calls for spending $818.7 million on those. That’s about 29 percent of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding from the transportation package. It just about matches Melendez’s claim that 30 percent of the new revenue is being set aside for what appear to be non-road projects. Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez's office said this chart from the governor's May budget backs up the claim. Response from Brown Administration We asked the governor’s staff about Melendez’s claim and about the categories that seem to have little to do with roads. Malcolm Dougherty, director of the California Department of Transportation, took issue with Melendez’s characterization that the budget \"diverts\" any money from its intended purpose. \"The dollars are being used exactly the way SB 1 presented them,\" Dougherty said, referring to the number of the Senate transportation funding bill that was signed into law. \"The funding package was always intended to include transit and rail.\" Transit, rail and active transportation programs represent about one-quarter of the proposed new spending. Paul Golaszewski, who researches transportation funding at the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst’s Office, agreed the governor’s budget \"adheres to SB1.\" He also noted that in future years, the share of money devoted purely to road projects, increases under the state’s funding plans. Why parks and job training? But that still leaves the question of why parks, universities, workforce and farm programs are getting any gas tax money. And whether those categories have anything to do with road projects. Dougherty, the Caltrans director, said that before SB1 was signed, existing laws required some gas tax revenue go to state parks and food and agriculture programs. Parks collect a portion of the tax on gasoline sales for off-road vehicles using the parks. Likewise, Dougherty said, food and agriculture programs get a slice of gas tax revenue when farmers purchase fuel for their vehicles, also under an existing law. Both laws remain in place after SB1. Dougherty added that the revenue for the parks and workforce training, the two categories cited by Melendez in her statement, represent less than 3 percent of the transportation revenue. The University of California and California State University systems will get a combined $7 million of the new revenue for what Dougherty called \"transportation related research.\" Finally, he said, the state’s workforce development board will get $5 million to prepare workers for jobs created by the transportation spending. Melendez’s spokesman pointed to a state workforce board budget document that proposes using that money for \"pre-apprenticeship training programs, focused on formerly incarcerated, women and minorities.\" SB 1 calls for the workforce board to create those programs. It also authorized the money for the universities. Our ruling California state Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget is \"diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons.\" There’s some truth to her claim: The governor’s May budget shows about 30 percent of the revenue from this transportation measure goes to categories that won’t directly improve roads for cars and trucks, as dictated by the law Brown signed in April. Most of that 30 percent goes to bicycle, transit and rail projects. Melendez, however, cherry-picked two programs -- parks and workforce training -- that represent less than 3 percent of the overall funding. Melendez’s statement also ignores the fact that roads will see an increased share of the overall funding in future years. Additionally, it’s misleading and simply not accurate for Melendez to say this money is being ‘diverted’ when Brown’s budget proposes to spend the money exactly as outlined in the bill he signed and the Legislature passed a month earlier. There should be no surprise, at this point, that the measure required funding for transit programs, railways and bicycle and pedestrian paths. The smaller spending on parks, universities and workforce development may raise eyebrows, but was also authorized by SB 1. Melendez’s overall statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.

            "[Evidences]:When lawmakers want to delay legislation from moving forward, they filibuster. In simple terms, that means they talk for a long time to hold up the bill. On social media, some users are presenting mangled history about the filibuster to take a swipe at Democrats over civil rights. The posts, which have appeared on Facebook and Twitter, say: \"The longest filibuster in U.S. history was 75 days. It took place in 1964, when Democrats tried to block the Civil Rights Act. It’d be a shame if this went viral.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more aboutour partnership with Facebook.) There was a lengthy fight in Washington before the Civil Rights Act was signed into law, but the post gets some aspects of history wrong and lumps all Democrats together in opposition. Democrats introduced the legislation and led its passage. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and provided protection of voting rights, banned discrimination in public facilities and established equal employment opportunity. Getting it passed wasn’t easy. The longest continuous debate in U.S. Senate history was brought on by a group of Southern Democrats over the legislation. But many northern Democrats supported the bill, and the filibuster lasted 60 days, not 75, according to the Senate’s website. Robert Gordon, a legal historian and law professor at Stanford University, told PolitiFact the post’s claim is misleading and pointed to Democratic support of the bill. \"The nay Democratic votes were all from the Southern bloc of the party. The former Confederate states had been effectively one-party states since Reconstruction,\" Gordon said. \"The Civil Rights Act was promoted by a former Southern Democrat, President Lyndon Johnson of Texas, and passed with the help of Northern Democrats and 27 Republicans.\" Shortly after President John F. Kennedy publicly called for a robust Civil Rights Act, Emmanuel Celler, a New York Democrat, introduced the House version of the bill on June 19, 1963, according to an article in the Smithsonian Magazine. Following Kennedy’s assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson strongly pushed for the measure and addressed a joint session in Congress days later, urging members to pass the bill. The House passed the measure in February 1964. Once it hit the Senate, it was met with opposition from a group of southern Democratic senators. The group, known as \"the Southern bloc\" of the party, represented former Confederate states and was predominantly led by West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan. At the time, a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, were required to invoke cloture and end the debate. That happened on June 10, when a coalition of 27 Republicans and 44 Democrats ended the filibuster with a 71-29 vote. On June 12, 1964, 46 Democrats and 27 Republicans voted for the legislation, and 21 Democrats and 6 Republicans voted against. It was signed into law July 2, 1964. Social media posts claim that Democrats hold the longest filibuster in U.S. history, which lasted 75 days, when they blocked the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It’s true that Democrats hold the longest filibuster in Senate history over the legislation, but it was led by a group of southern Democrats, not all Democrats, and lasted 60 days, not 75. Many Democrats from non-Southern states supported the bill and helped end the debate. Democrats wrote the bill and Democrats led its passage in the Senate. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Everything was better in the old days, apparently -- including the chore of paying for college, at least according to a social media meme sent to us recently by a reader. The meme -- created by OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, \"In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.\" Really? We figured this was worth a look. First, the minimum wage. Starting on Jan. 1, 1978, the minimum wage was $2.65. Someone working at the minimum wage for 13 weeks, and 40 hours per week, in the summer of 1978 would have ended up with $1,378 for their labors. For the tuition they would have faced in the 1978-79 school year, we turned to figures from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government’s repository of education data. The cost of tuition and fees (in that year’s dollars, not adjusted for inflation) was $688 for in-state residents attending a four-year, public university. So the meme’s claim is correct except for a few caveats -- two minor and one more significant: • The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board was significantly higher that year -- $2,145 -- but the meme was careful to cite \"tuition\" only, so we’ll ignore the impact of room and board. • The tuition-and-fees figure we used is a national average, so some states may have had in-state tuition rates out of reach of minimum wage workers. • The meme’s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording -- specifically its use of the phrase \"of their choice.\" The data we used refers to in-state tuition, meaning that the student would have access to this sweet tuition rate only at their home-state university. That’s not the same thing as \"of their choice.\" Our ruling The meme said that \"in 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.\" If you use the national average the figure is correct. The only problem is the part about a university \"of their choice.\" The data is correct for in-state tuition -- not for any university in the country, where out-of-state rates may well have kicked up the tuition amount beyond a summer’s minimum-wage haul. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. CORRECTION: After we published this article, a reader noticed that we had used the incorrect tuition figure from the National Center for Education Statistics chart. This version uses the correct figure. The rating remains at Mostly True. \n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"The oil and natural gas industry provides or supports 141,600 jobs in Georgia.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Anything that has to do with jobs captures the scribes’ eyes here at PolitiFact Georgia. And it was an eye-popping number of jobs that the American Petroleum Institute attributed to the oil and gas industry in a recent press release. \"The oil and natural gas industry provides or supports 141,600 jobs in Georgia,\" according to the blog posting designed to highlight the economic and job impact the energy industry has on the Peach State. This for a state that has yet to produce a single drop of commercially produced gas or oil, we wondered? The numbers The API cited a 2013 report that it commissioned, Economic Impacts of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry on the U.S. Economy in 2011, from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report includes state-by-state breakdowns on how many jobs have been created, as well as the overall economic impact of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. The analysis arrives at the 141,600 job estimate first with data from the U.S. bureaus of Economic Analysis and of Labor Statistics for a dozen job codes. The report breaks that job tally into three categories. It says 42,638 jobs were directly involved in the oil and natural gas industry. That includes the expected extraction and production jobs and – as we will get to in a moment – a total of 29,146 jobs at gas stations with and without convenience stores. If that were the only category, those jobs would account for just 0.8 percent of all Georgia jobs. But the report classifies another 33,502 workers as indirectly involved in the oil and gas industry, or with positions in activities in outside industries that supply those fields. Drew Lyon, principal and leader of the national economics and statistics group at PwC and the author of the report, said care was taken to eliminate double counts so that some suppliers who would have been in the direct jobs tally were removed. Then the largest number of jobs -- 65,490 -- are counted as \"induced\" jobs. Lyon said those are the positions that are created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs. In that category, the general \"service\" field has by far the most indirect and induced jobs, with 43,349 workers – or 711 more employees than work directly for the oil and natural gas industries. Considering those jobs are apt to be in professional services, healthcare, education and the like – all known powerhouses in metro Atlanta’s economy -- those numbers are not surprising. And to Lyon, they show how many of those back office jobs -- say in human resources -- owe their existence to an industry thought of as minor in the Peach State. \"It’s no surprise, for example, that a significant amount of employment in Texas is directly related to oil and gas,\" Lyon said. \"But it’s of interest in how other states, either as suppliers to in-state or out-of-state producers, or through some of these other industries, are impacted by the oil and gas industry.\" Taken together, that brings the total to 141,600 jobs, or 2.7 percent of the Georgia workforce. But is it fair to count all of those jobs, knowing that two thirds of the positions in question are outside the oil and gas industries? Bruce Seaman, an economist at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said he was not troubled with the methodology of the study. The report took care not to count jobs twice and also used commonly accepted input-output models to show the known relationships between industries (Basically, the output from one industry become inputs in another but must be adjusted not to exaggerate the impact). That said, Seaman wondered about the service station employees, who primarily are not working as pump attendants or mechanics. Especially at stations with stores, those workers are apt to run the cash registers, do janitorial work or even cook. \"Those jobs are more accurately convenience store retail jobs,\" Seaman said. The BLS codes back up that assessment, listing those positions as retail, versus the mining or production jobs expected in oil and gas. Lyon said PwC included those gas station positions as a best estimate of companies and jobs that exist only because of the gas and oil industry. Reid Porter, a spokesman at API, agreed, adding \"What happens in the oil and natural gas industry reverberates throughout the entire economy.\" Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute recently released a series of press releases, drawing attention to the economic impact of the oil and gas industry on every state. Georgia, it said, has 141,600 jobs provided or supported by oil and gas. A 2011 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers backs up the number by looking at direct positions in the industry, supportive jobs and, accounting for most of the workers, all of the positions created from the industry and its supply chain. The math and economics are right – to a point. But careful examination of the report shows that 68 percent of the jobs counted as directly working in the oil and gas industry could just as easily be classified as retail workers. Adjusting the base number up by 29,146 workers, then, amplifies the number of jobs that support the industry or caters to its whims. The report is clear that it counts those positions, though. And the claim takes care to say the industry \"supports\" that large number of workers. It’s accurate, but somewhat misleading. We rate the claim Mostly True.\n",

Ditto for ad copy such as “My friends tell me the graphics are the best. I don’t know what that means, but …” and “Stevie likes to play alone, even if he has no idea what’s happening.” Indeed, the Atari ad was merely a spoof using an altered version of a real print advertisement featuring Wonder endorsing the Mu-Tron III envelope filter made by Musitronics Corporation: \n",

            "[Evidences]:Portland Public Schools, like most of Oregon’s school districts, is struggling to keep class sizes down and school years full even as budget conditions force reductions.In a recent opinion piece printed in The Oregonian, one parent advocate suggested the district try harder to consolidate schools before asking voters to approve a bond. \"Cut bureaucracy,\" wrote Lainie Block Wilker. \"Media reports confirm PPS' top-heavy bureaucracy. KPMG's audit recommended reducing management layers.\"This didn’t sit so well with some school board members, who promptly responded with their own opinion piece, also printed by The Oregonian. (Five others also signed onto this commentary.)\"Wilker claims that PPS administration is \"top-heavy,\" wrote members Ruth Adkins and Trudy Sargent. \"The 14-year-old KPMG audit she cites actually commended the district for ‘maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounts for 8 percent of PPS' total staff.’ Since then, central administration has been reduced by one-half and is now less than 4 percent of PPS's staff. Next year's budget further reduces central staff by 10 percent. Central administrative costs are not a reason to oppose the bond.\"As reporters, we’re always a little suspicious when it comes to bureaucratic management, so we decided to check out the claim that central administration is \"less than 4 percent of PPS’s staff.\"First, we went back to the audit that got flagged in both commentaries. The \"Comprehensive Performance Audit of the Portland Public Schools\" was published Sept. 3, 1998, by auditing firm KPMG. The audit points out several shortcomings of the district -- but the size of the administration is certainly not one.In one section, as the two board members point out, the audit commends the district for \"maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounts for 8% of PPS’ total staff.\" That’s not to say the audit didn’t find some places for further reductions. Auditors identified various areas where management could be shaved, but time and time again it confirms that the number of management layers and the ratio of managers to non-managers met industry \"best practices.\"The auditors, unfortunately, did not clarify what they meant by \"administrative staff.\" We called the auditing firm, but they weren’t able to track down anybody familiar enough with the 14-year-old audit to give us definitions.Our next stop was Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby, who outlined the staff breakdown for this year and next. The Oregon Department of Education asks school districts to classify spending under four specific categories: direct classroom, classroom support, building support and central support.Currently, there are about 152 full-time-equivalent positions in central support at Portland Public Schools. This category, according to the state’s definition, includes \"executive administration, business and fiscal services, personnel services, retirement incentives, and public information.\" That means it covers the superintendent’s office, as well as the legal, finance, insurance and human relation divisions -- among others.All told, there are some 4,048 budgeted FTE positions, which means that the board members were right -- central support makes up just under 4 percent of the total PPS staffing.That said, even though it’s a rigidly managed state definition, central support doesn’t cover all the positions that your average Oregonian might call \"administrative.\" Building support, for example, which has 596 budget positions, includes IT, security, utilities, purchasing, warehouse and others. Direct classroom and classroom support make up the majority of staffing, more than 80 percent, including teachers, curriculum services, social work services, athletics and others.All this is to say, yes, \"central support\" -- which is the word the school board members used in their commentary -- is less than 4 percent of the PPS staff. But that definition covers a very specific sort of employee and not necessarily every employee that somebody on the outside might consider \"administrative.\"Now, for that last bit. Is central support really getting cut by 10 percent next year? At first blush, no. There are 152 positions budgeted this year and 146 budgeted for the next. That’s a 4 percent decline. We checked in with Robb Cowie, the district’s chief spokesman, who pointed out that central support is really losing 15 positions when you consider that eight translation service positions are moving from other areas to central support. If you ignore that transfer, the board members are right about the 10 percent reduction.Is Portland Public Schools \"top-heavy\" as one parent advocate described it? That’s really not for us to say. What we can say, however, is that central support -- as the state defines it -- accounts for 4 percent of the budgeted positions at Portland Public Schools. We can also say that central support will see a 10 percent reduction in its current FTE positions next year. Technically, then, the board members are right on all counts. However, there’s some important context in the fact that central support is a bureaucratic term that doesn’t necessarily reflect the full scope of administrative employees working for Portland Public Schools.We rate this claim Mostly True -- it’s accurate, but it requires some clarification.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Central Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is digging on some 1970s Led Zeppelin in his first ad attacking Republican opponent Daniel Webster.The ad is called \"Dan Webster's Stairway to Nowhere.\" See where this is going, Zeppelin fans?It opens with someone ripping off Jimmy Page's recognizable guitar introduction to \"Stairway to Heaven.\" A narrator talks over a black-and-white image of Webster, a longtime state legislator and former House speaker.\"When career politician Daniel Webster became speaker of the House, he wasted $32,000 of our money on a spiral staircase for his office,\" the narrator says, before moving on to a claim that he used tax money for private flights.The ad then finishes with a spin off of Robert Plant's vocals.\"And he's charged us for a stairway to nowhere.\"To be honest, it's a pretty poor rendition.But we're PolitiFact Florida, not American Idol, so we'll stick to the factual claims in the ad -- specifically about the stairwell.Stepping stones to the staircaseWebster was elected to the state House in 1980. In 1996, he became the first Republican state House speaker in more than 100 years after the GOP seized power.That also put him in charge of improvements and renovations to House offices and facilities. Each new speaker traditionally has made changes, upgrades, or renovations. In 1999, Speaker John Thrasher, now a state senator and chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, approved nearly $7 million for the House chamber -- now adorned in mahogany -- the Speaker's Office, and House office building.In 2002, leaders of the House and Senate spent about $1.5 million on furniture, structural changes, even a private bathroom. On the other hand, former Speaker Allan Bense spent only about $1,500 on changes in 2004, according to the St. Petersburg Times.According to newspaper accounts Webster spent about $100,000 in taxpayer dollars on improvements to House facilities in his first months as speaker, including $31,983 on a spiral staircase.The staircase connected the Republican Majority Office on the Capitol's third floor with the Speaker's Office above it on the fourth floor. The staircase was intended to make it easier to move back and forth between the two offices -- namely, it allowed legislators and Webster as speaker to avoid walking through the public hallways filled with lobbyists, reporters and members of the public. The staircase \"will allow us to better coordinate things between the Speaker's Office and the Majority Office,\" Webster said at the time. He also noted that he took the idea from Democrats, who previously had drawn up plans for a spiral staircase of their own. It was built in a spiral style because it was the only way it could work given the space. The Grayson ad includes an image of an elaborate white spiral staircase to help make its point about Webster. But that's not the Webster staircase, said Todd Reid, staff director for the Florida House Majority Office. The staircase was closed off in 2006 during more than $500,000 of renovations ordered by then-Speaker Marco Rubio. The stairway's fourth-floor landing became the new offices of the speaker's chief of staff. \"It was a standard black metal staircase,\" Reid said. \"It certainly wasn't heavy on the accouterments.\" Reid described the staircase as noisy and said whenever someone walked up or down it, people could hear the staircase rattling from both offices. He said the bottom half of the staircase remains in place; a closet was built around it. \"If you were in Tallahassee, I'd take you in to see it,\" Reid told PolitiFact Florida. Your humble fact-checker didn't have time to jump in a car for the five-hour trip to Tallahassee, but we were able to send the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald's Lee Logan for an exclusive tour. Cribs: Staircase to Nowhere-edition Logan filed the following report, complete with a picture. Behind a door labeled \"No Entry\" in the House Majority Office is the famed Webster staircase. The small closet without lights is used so rarely that Reid had to hunt down someone in the House Sergeant at Arms office to get a key to the door. The bottom half of the black spiral staircase is still bolted to the floor. (Stairs are simple black metal, with a black metal railing.) Pieces of the top half are also in the closet, including a large piece that rests on top of the lower portion.The ceiling of the closet is now covered over with concrete, forming the floor of the chief of staff's office on the fourth floor. Reid says it's unlikely the stairway would be re-installed because the fourth floor spot is \"prime real estate\" -- now the House speaker and his chief of staff have direct access to one another through a door.Before Rubio made the space into the chief of staff's office, the staircase came up through a hole in the floor and emptied into a common area that also housed a few supplies.Reid said the closet could be used for supplies if the stairs were removed. But he speculated that they weren't taken out because they're simply too big. Also, a speaker sometime in the future might find a use for the stairs.The stairs were used \"irregularly,\" Reid said, usually on peak days when the Capitol was crowded. He also recalled former Gov. Jeb Bush occasionally using the stairs.Currently, if a staffer (not Joe Public) wanted to go from the Majority Office to the Speaker's Office, he or she could go up a back stairwell and cut through the Member's Lounge, which requires a key card and is reserved for lawmakers. Speaker Larry Cretul has said staffers can cut through the area if they don't loiter or disturb the lawmakers. Our ruling Grayson's ad is unintentionally ironic in that Webster's \"stairway to nowhere\" actually now is a stairway to nowhere, as it'sbolted to the ground of a seldom-used closet. The stairway leads to a concrete ceiling, which now serves as the floor of an office above. Those changes were made by Marco Rubio in 2006. The stairs haven't been used since then. But that's not how Webster left it.When he became speaker in 1996, Webster did what most every speaker has done in recent times -- he spent taxpayer money on House renovations. The amount has varied wildly over the years depending on the size of the renovation.Among the $100,000 or so Webster spent, he allocated just under $32,000 for a plain spiral staircase to internally link the Speaker's Office with the House Republican Offices below.While Grayson's ad is correct on the reported dollar amount and the type of staircase, we think it's slightly misleading for two reasons. First, the imagery displayed suggests an ornate staircase when the staircase is far from ornate and only a spiral staircase by necessity. Second, it fails to provide the context that most every speaker spends taxpayer dollars on renovations, and several spent more than Webster. We rate the claim Mostly True.Now cue the Led Zeppelin ... (Update Sept. 1: We reached out to the Webster campaign before publishing this story via phone and e-mail, but did not hear back. After publication, Webster spokesman Brian Graham said in an e-mail that the staircase actually cost less than published reports. The original construction contract was for $28,126. The state paid even less, $22,242, Graham said). (Update Sept. 3: We noticed that the Grayson ad has been removed from his You Tube web page. We're not sure why).\n",

In an Oct. 20 exchange with reporters, Trump called Saudi Arabia’s initial arrests and firings of top officials in the case a \"good first step.\" As for how the United States should respond, Trump offered a dose of realpolitik. \"With all that being said though, we have $450 billion, $110 billion of which is a military order, but this is equipment and various things ordered from Saudi Arabia, $450 billion,\" Trump said. \"I think it's over a million jobs. That's not helpful for us to cancel an order like that. That hurts us far more than it hurts them.\" The $110 billion in arms sales to the Saudis would be eye-popping enough, but this was the first time we heard the $450 billion total that included everything else. Nor has Trump said that 1million jobs are on the line. We decided to check those points. Saudi Arabia has not ordered $110 billion worth of military goods and services. Saudi Arabia has not ordered $450 billion worth of goods and services across the board. Over one million jobs are not at stake. The $110 billion in military contracts emerged from Trump’s 2017 meeting with King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. (Mohamed bin Salman is now crown prince and sits at the center of the speculation over the circumstances of Khashoggi’s death.) \"President Trump and King Salman participated in the signing ceremony for almost $110 billion worth of defense capabilities,\" the White House announced. The press release said the arms package expanded opportunities for American companies in the region, \"potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.\" Note: Tens of thousands is a far cry from hundreds of thousands of jobs, but we’ll get back to that in a moment. The $110 billion itself is in doubt. \"The $110 billion is not even remotely solid,\" said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley. \"The State Department only counts $14.5 billion in implemented’ sales from this deal.\" And even that sum is suspect, Caverley added. The U.S. approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution in Washington said that deal is on shaky ground. \"The Saudis let pass a September deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin,\" Riedel recently wrote. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency oversees foreign military sales. Not counting the THAAD contract, its summary of sales to Saudi Arabia under Trump totals a little over $2 billion. Defense analyst Rachel Stohl at the Stimson Center, a private defense policy think tank, noted that the $110 billion rolled in some old offers. \"Many of those were deals negotiated under the Obama administration, and only a small fraction have been filled,\" Stohl said. That’s the typical pattern for these announcements: Fanfare comes first, followed by a more modest reality. \"President Obama offered Saudi Arabia something like $115 billion in arms while in office, and just about half of that resulted in sales,\" Jennifer Spindel, an international security professor at the University of Oklahoma, told us. And even sale agreements take a long time to play out. In the past 10 years, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries. That time lag has major implications for jobs. Before we get into the dicey link between contracts and jobs in America, it’s important to note that some of the deals involve building things in Saudi Arabia, not the United States. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Development touted partnerships in 2016 to build Black Hawk helicopters and space video surveillance satellites in the kingdom. So sales contracts don’t necessarily lead to manufacturing jobs in America. With that caveat, let’s look at the one year where we have estimates that tie jobs at home to all exports to Saudi Arabia, whether that’s planes, corn or software consultants. In 2015, the U.S. Commerce Department said exports \"supported an estimated 165,000 jobs.\" That included both direct jobs and the knock-on effect of the money from those sales working through the economy. The same year, exports totalled $29.7 billion. Divide the jobs by the dollars and you find that for every dollar in exports, the United States gets .0000056 of a job. Which might not like sound like much, but obviously it does when you start talking about billions in sales. Now, if the $110 billion in arms sales were locked down and came in one single year, the math says they would generate more than 600,000 jobs. Here’s why that isn’t in the cards. We know the $110 billion is at best aspirational, but the other big issue is that military contracts play out over many years. The arms experts we reached said smaller ones of about $200 to $300 million typically take three to four years for completion. The bigger systems take much longer. \"A decade is the ballpark in terms of minimum time between initial signing of a deal and the delivery of the capability, with money disbursed across the life of the contract,\" Caverley at the War College said. \"It will probably take even longer given the new Saudi requirements that 50 percent of the work needs to be performed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will have to develop a massive amount of defense industrial capability that currently does not exist in order to handle this work.\" Even if Saudi Arabia bought everything it said it wanted, the yearly jobs impact would be more in the range of 60,000 to 120,000. That’s not close to the hundreds of thousands Trump has talked about. Trump said that all told, Saudi Arabia has $450 billion in orders from the United States. We asked the White House and the U.S. - Saudi Arabian Business Council for any data on this. We did not hear back. Total exports of goods and services in 2017 were $25.4 billion. Hossein Askari, a business professor at George WashingtonUniversity, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump’s assertion. \"There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion,\" Askari said. Trump said that Saudi Arabia has ordered $450 billion from U.S. companies, including $110 billion in military contracts, representing over a million jobs. Orders on that scale don’t exist. There is no data behind the $450 billion, and the $110 billion is a blend of smaller deals in progress, old offers that have not come through, and speculative discussions that have yet to move forward. Trump’s claims about jobs ignores the long runway between signed agreements and actual delivery and payment. He treats spending that could play out over a decade as if it were spent in one year. More importantly, if the $450 billion in orders is a mirage, the 1 million jobs is equally without substance. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n",

            "[Evidences]:New Delhi (Team Vishvas). A Facebook post claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hired a makeup artist who is paid 15 lakh rupees a month has gone viral on the social media. In our investigation we found that the claim is false. The photo is from 2016 when a team from Madame Tussauds wax museum visited Prime Minister Modi’s house to collect measurements for a wax replica they were building in their museum. Claim The post was shared by a Facebook page called ‘Beware of FROUD MEDIA’. In the photo, a woman could be seen standing alongside Modi. The post claims that the woman in the photo is PM’s personal Make-Up artist who has been hired at a salary of Rs 15 lakh a month. Fact Check To know the truth behind the viral post, we took a screenshot of the image and searched it on Google Reverse Image Search tool. This landed us on a news story of ndtv.com. The same image was used in the story. The story was about Narendra Modi’s wax statue being installed at Madame Tussauds Museum. The video consisted of a video where this same screen grab could be seen. The news was uploaded on the website on March 17, 2016. We searched for the official website of Madame Tussaud Museum and there presence on social media. We found this video uploaded on Youtube from the official channel of Madame Tussaud Museum. It was uploaded on March 16, 2016. In this 58-second video, Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be seen with Madame Tussaud’s Artist. The video comes with a caption: “Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been involved in the creation of his figure and gave Madame Tussauds renowned artists a sitting at his residence in New Delhi earlier this year.” Looking at the video, one can see that the woman standing next to Modi was not applying make-up on PM Modi’s face, as alleged in the caption, but is holding up an eyeball while a study of Modi’s facial features was being done for the wax statue. This video has more than 76 million views so far. Not only this, more than 600 people have commented on this video. We also found a picture on Madame Tussaud’s Facebook page where Narendra Modi can be seen watching his statue. This photo was posted on April 20, 2016. On Youtube, we also found a video that showed the making of Modi’s wax Statue. This video was uploaded on Madame Tussaud’s Youtube Channel of Singapore on May 19, 2016. We decided to scan the account of the person who shared this image on facebook. With the help of StalkScan, we found that most of the posts on ‘Beware of FROUD MEDIA’ Facebook page are against the government and Narendra Modi. This page is followed by five million people. The admin of this page is Facebook user Harish Humanist. Harish is the native of Agra and resides in New Delhi. According to his profile, he is working as a supervisor in Delhi Metro. Conclusion: In our investigation we found that the post claiming that PM Modi has hired a make-up artist at a salary of Rs 15 lakh per month is fake.

            "claim [Claim]: Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington declined a $50 million project from Disney and said the company is \"just too woke.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:About this rating On Aug. 30, 2023, the website USA World News on faithhopel.info published an article with the headline, \"Breaking: Denzel Washington Declines Disney's $50 Million Project, 'They're Too Woke.'\" The articleabout the Oscar-winning actor, which also was published on newsc87.com,began as follows: In a shocking turn of events, Denzel Washington, the actor known for his nuanced portrayals of complex characters, has turned down a whopping $50 million project with Disney. The reason? According to Washington, Disney is \"just too woke\" for him. While some might see this as a principled stand, others are left wondering if Washington's alarm clock is just set a few hours behind the times. Over the past few years, Disney has been on a mission to out-woke every other studio in Hollywood. From introducing a princess who's passionate about recycling to a prince who's a vocal advocate for veganism, Disney has been ticking off every box in the progressive handbook. Rumor has it that their next project involves a musical number about composting set in the world of \"Frozen\". Elsa and Anna singing about the benefits of organic waste? Now that's a sequel worth waiting for. Denzel, however, seems to have missed the memo about Hollywood's new direction. When asked about his decision, he remarked, \"I just wanted to do a film about a regular guy who recycles because it's the right thing to do, not because he's trying to impress his eco-conscious love interest.\" Ah, the good old days when characters had depth beyond their recycling habits. The rest of the article said that \"#TooWokeForDenzel\" had trended online, \"with many sharing memes of Washington looking confused by modern trends like avocado toast and electric cars.\" However, this story, one that cited zero sources, was completely made up. Still, a search of the headline showed that Facebook users were sharing and commenting on the article as if Washington truly had turned down $50 million from Disney to take a stand on \"wokeness.\" For example, one Facebook user posted thecomment,\"Principals!! [sic] Something most in Hollywood, the media, and the leftist Democrats do not have. Good for you Denzel, keep standing up for what is right!\" Other users thanked Washington for supposedly taking a stand, while another person wrote, \"Fuck you woke assholes.\" We scanned paragraphs from the story on two AI-detection tools to see if they had been written by artificial intelligence. However, both tools on copyleaks.com and writer.comindicated the article was very likely written by a person. According to the \"About Us\" page on the USA World News website, its content originated from a writer residing in Pakistan. This rumor was similar to another claim that we previously reported about that said Washington declined a role for a Marvel movie produced by Disney that would have earned him $30 million, also purportedly due to \"wokeness.\" However, that article was published on a website that described its content as \"parody, satire and tomfoolery.\" We also recently published a fact check about a false claim that said Washington had made public remarks in support of \"Sound of Freedom,\" a film that centers on child-sex trafficking. In reality, there was no evidence he had ever made any such remarks.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Mudavadi was mostly correct that Kenya spends more on repaying debt than on its development expenditure. This has been the trend for the past six years, since the start of the Kenyatta administration.While Mudavadi was also correct that the budget for the judiciary is about half that allocated to parliament, he fudged some crucial facts in his explanations of why this shouldn’t be so.It is incorrect and misleading to say courts sit for six days a week compared to parliament’s three, and Mudavadi was also incorrect about the number of staff employed by both institutions.The state of Kenya’s economy continues toanimate public discussions, as thecash-strapped governmenttries to make ends meet.On 11 June 2020treasury cabinet secretaryUkur Yatani gave a much-watchedbudget statementin the national assembly.In reaction, opposition politicianMusalia Mudavadi, himself aformer finance minister,poked holes inthe spending planfor the new financial year which started on 1 July.Inan interviewon national TV on 11 June, Mudavadi specifically criticised the allocation for debt repayments, and also focused on funding for parliament and thejudiciary.The former vice president and deputy prime minister has recentlybeen criticalof the government's handling of the economy. On TV he made six key claims which we took a closer look at.We asked Mudavadi for evidence for the claims, and will update this report with his response. In the interview, he frequently referred to Yatani’s budget statement.Claim ‘We are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure.’ Verdict correctCurrent levels of the public debt are a national talking point. There isa proposalto set up an agency to oversee this. In his speech, Yatani said Kenya had to be “cautious about future debt accumulation” and would look to borrow cheaply.But the budget had not shown any urgency to correct a “critical landmine”, Mudavadi said. He gave the amount set aside for debt repayment as “KSh900 billion, almost KSh1 trillion”.“We are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure,” hesaid. “This is a crisis!”How much for loan payments?How much has been budgeted for debt repayment? Areportfrom the national assembly’s budget committee said that debt service for the 2020/21 financial year was an estimated KSh904.7 billion.The cost of debt financing “actually consumes more financial resources than development expenditure for which the debt is obtained”, the committeesaid.What about for development projects?The budget committee approvedKSh637.6 billionas the development budget. The treasury hadproposedKSh584.3 billion, while minister Yatani said the amount was KSh633.1 billion in his budget speech. All these figures are less than that set aside for repaying debt.To evaluate how much money has been used over the years to repay debt and for development, the monthly statements issued by treasury are beneficial, James Muraguri told Africa Check. He is the chief executive of theInstitute of Public Finance-Kenya.“This is the best document to use because it provides the actual money that is released out of the consolidated fund,” Muraguri said.Theconsolidated fundis where all income raised and revenues collected by the national government is kept. The fund first provides for obligatory payments such as debt repayments, salaries for some state officers and pensions.Only after these are paidcan other departments access the money.We checked all the treasury’s annual statements since 2013, when president Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration started, to establish if debt repayments exceeding the development budget was a once off, or a trend.Debt service versus development expenditure Financial year Debt service (KSh bn) Development expenditure (KSh bn) 2013/14 227.6 224.4 2014/15 416.2 270.3 2015/16 421.8 333.2 2016/17 435.7 394.2 2017/18 517.2 276.4 2018/19 826.2 306.5 TOTAL 2,844.7 1,805The numbers show debt repayments have exceeded the development budget for the last six financial years. The budgeted figures for the 2019/20 financial year, which ended 30 June, alsoshowdebt service was expected to take up KSh696.6 billion, while the development budget wasKSh704.2 billion.However, by 29 May, a month before the end of the financial year,KSh639.2 billionhad been issued to pay debts, whileKSh295 billionhad been issued for development expenditure. We therefore rate Mudavadi’s claim as correct.What’s the crisis?Kenya’s economy is import dependent , James Muraguri, the chief executive of the Institute of Public Finance-Kenya told Africa Check. This means it imports the bulk of goods meant for its domestic market.More than half of Kenya’s public debt is owed to foreign creditors. Servicing this debt and paying for its imports must be in dollars. With this crucial foreign currency leaving the country, the country’s economy can be left exposed.“The pressure on the current account at the central bank will be felt due to demand for the [US] dollar and the shilling losing ground,” Muraguri said. (Note: For more on the functions of foreign exchange reserves, read here . )Claim ‘Parliament is getting KSh38 billion, the judiciary is getting KSh18 billion, basically 50% [of parliament’s allocation].’ Verdict mostly-correctIn the budget speech, the finance minister proposed funding of KSh37.3 billion to parliament and KSh18.1 billion to the judiciary for the 2020/21 financial year. The estimates approved by parliament show that it will get KSh37.7 billion while the judiciary will get KSh18.1 billionWe therefore rate Mudavadi’s statement as mostly correct.Claim ‘Remember the judiciary sits six days in a week …’ Verdict incorrectMudavadi claimed that when not following the revised timetable set in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, the courts sit six days in a week. His argument was that the judiciary was underfunded.We asked the judiciary if this was correct.“Courts do not usually sit on Saturday or Sunday unless they have express permission from the chief justice in writing, and that has to be under exceptional circumstances,”Catherine Wambui, acting director of communications at the judiciary, told Africa Check.She said this was rare, and cited the14-day deadlineimposed byKenya’s constitution within which presidential election petitions must be determined as an example of when this had happened.During presidential election petition hearings in 2013 and in 2017, the judiciary sat on Saturday and Sunday.But it is not the norm for Kenyan courts to sit six days a week. They sit from Monday to Friday and do not sit on public holidays.Judicial staff may also be called in to work on public holidays to “to perform certain essential duties”, according to the judiciary’shuman resources manual.Claim ‘... and parliament sits three days a week.’ Verdict misleadingat “2.30 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday”.However, the rules allow each of the two houses, by resolution “to meet at any other time on a sitting day; or to meet on any other day, in order to transact business”.Caroline Gaita is the chief executive ofMzalendo Trust, a project that keeps tabs on parliamentary performance in Kenya. She said the perception that sitting days are the only working days for the Kenyan parliament was misleading.Equating the sitting days to their working days is doing a disservice to their role, she told Africa Check.“The work of a member of parliament cannot be limited to the three days when the house sits,” she told Africa Check. “That is for their legislative role. They have other roles such as oversight and representation which are done through committees and/or physical visits to the constituencies”.She added: “On Fridays, throughout the weekend, and on Mondays they are usually in the constituencies. Committee meetings are usually held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.”We therefore rate Mudavadi’s claim as misleading.Claim ‘The Judiciary has “almost 7,000 employees”.’ Verdict incorrectThe lateststate of the judiciary reportwasreleasedin January 2020.It covers the 2018/19 financial year andshowsthe judiciary had 5,584 employees on 30 June 2019. These were 153 judges, 546 magistrates and 4,885 other employees including registrars, legal researchers, law clerks and court assistants.In the financial year 2019/20 the judiciarywas expectedto hire 300 new employees.At the highest, the number of employees in the judiciary could only be 5,884. Mudavadi was off the mark by more than 1,000 employees. We therefore rate his claim as incorrect.Claim ‘Compare that with parliament with about 1,000 employees.’ Verdict incorrectAfrica Check haspreviously fact-checkedthis claim and found out that Kenya’s bicameral parliament had 9,940 staff as of 19 March 2019.Theclerk of the senate, Jeremiah Nyegenye, who is also the secretary of theparliamentary service commission, the administrative arm of parliament,shared datawith Africa Checkshowing that in March 2019 there were:830 permanent and pensionable parliamentary staff, 282 contract staff, and 10 seconded staff6,740 constituency staff in the 290 constituencies and 47 county offices46 staff serving 12 nominated lawmakersIn the senate, 940 staff serving 47 elected senators, and 64 serving nominated senators1,022 police officers attached to lawmakers in both houses(Note: We have reached out to Nyegenye about the latest employee numbers in parliament. We’ll update this report when we get his response.)This is well over 1,000 employees. We therefore rate Mudavadi’s claim as incorrect.\n",

            "[Evidences]:There are no documents or reliable resources on the alleged case. It has only been featured on non-credible sites. It has been reported that a family from Boston refused to vaccinate their 14-year-old child. The court intervened and terminated custody to prevent her from getting vaccinated without their permission. However, the story has not been featured on any reliable news websites, and there are no court documents available. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, a legally authorized representative (usually a parent or guardian) must consent to vaccinate their children aged 12 to 17 by filling out a written consent form that the minor (person under the age of 18) can bring to their vaccination appointment. Only the Pfizer vaccination is available to people aged 12 to 17. The Boston Municipal Court website has not published any news or announcements that indicate the court intervening and terminating custody for a 14-year-old girl who wanted to be vaccinated but couldn't secure her parents' approval. According to Logically, Dr. Robert Malone has been promoting himself as the inventor of mRNA vaccines which is misleading. In 1989, Malone published a paper titled \"Cationic liposome-mediated RNA transfection.\" While this paper is an example of his essential contribution to the then-emerging field, it does not make him the inventor of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, Logically checked court records online and could not find details related to the story. Cases related to minors or family law may not be available for public view. However, as the story has been featured on several non-credible sites without proper accreditation or sources, we have marked the story as false. We will update the story if more details become clear. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation.

For those of you who send this along, I thank you so much. But for those who don’t send it, I will still pray for you. Please, if you are a kind person, have a heart. Please, please, PLEASE HIT THE FORWARD BUTTON. Thank you,Amy Bruce The Make-A-Wish Foundation does not in any way assist in procuring medical treatment for sick children. It works to grant the wishes of youngsters with life-threatening medical conditions, but the Make-A-Wish Foundation is about “enriching the human experience with hope, strength, and joy” by helping to create special days for desperately ill children, not about collecting donations to pay for medical care. The fictitious Amy Bruce is often credited with penning the “Slow Dance” poem which was actually written by an adult male child psychologist. A March 2009 version of the hoax that was spread by text message to cell phones changed the name “Amy Bruce” to “Erik Bruce” or “Erick Bruce”: Hi, my name is Erik bruce. I’m 7 yrs old, I have a large tumor on my brain and severe lung cancer. The doctors say I will die soon if this isn’t fixed and my family can’t pay the bills.” The make a wish foundation has agreed 2 donate 7 cents 4 everytime this message is sent on 4 those who fwd this i thankyou but 4 those who don’t I’ll pray 4u anyway This is not a joke. A 2017 version changed the name to “Annakay Brown.”\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:A bill requiring physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts is moving through the Legislature without the usual partisan fight, though some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. An anti-abortion activist used a specific figure in a recent committee hearing to reassure lawmakers HB 1129/SB 1636 is necessary. \"The tragedy of infants born alive following attempted abortions is real,\" said Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, on April 9. \"It is not the hypothetical that is sometimes reported. In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year.\" Yoest said without elaborating there are two cases in Florida. After the meeting, reporters asked Yoest about the number she used. Yoest told them the figure came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC, which collects data from most state health departments on the number of legal induced abortions performed each year, does not collect data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. Neither does the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports women’s access to abortions and collects abortion data. Neither Guttmacher nor the CDC has published its 2010 data for abortions. \"We have no idea where this number comes from,\" said Rebecca Wind, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman. A committee analysis says there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions. So Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, included in his legislation a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. \"If in two years time or four years time we find that there are zero cases, it’s a prayer answered,\" Pigman said at an April 4 committee hearing of his bill. \"If we find in two years time that there’s a half dozen cases a year, then we have some issues.\" If there are no statistics or reporting requirements, where did Americans United for Life find this figure? We dug in. Twenty-eight states have laws protecting infants born alive. \"Infants Born Alive\" mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Supporters say it is necessary to enact a state law so there is no doubt that an infant \"born alive\" -- defined as an infant who breathes or has heartbeats or muscle movements, regardless of whether the extraction method was natural or induced -- must be taken to a hospital for treatment appropriate for gestation age. A failed abortion could result in a live birth in a late-term abortion, which can only be performed if two physicians agree the mother's life is at risk, or if the mother was further into her pregnancy than thought. Physicians under the Florida proposal would have to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion or face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. Pigman, an emergency physician, has referenced similar or exact figures as Yoest in committee hearings, but he characterized them differently and stressed the lack of exact data. In the bill’s first hearing, Pigman mentioned CDC data on deaths for infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth called \"other perinatal conditions.\" This category -- which totaled 1,270 deaths in 2010 -- is further broken down into categories of international medical codes for causes of death, including cardiovascular disorders (838 deaths), digestive system disorders (92 deaths), undefined cerebral problems (183 deaths) and \"other conditions originating in the perinatal period\" (130 deaths). \"I don’t know which portion of that 1,270 were due to abortions or some other rare circumstances,\" Pigman said in the April 4 committee. Inside that latter subcategory -- \"other conditions originating in the perinatal period\" -- is a designation called \"termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn.\" The CDC doesn’t have numbers for that designation for 2010 yet. In 2008, the CDC reported 33 deaths using that designation. Whether the abortion was elective or performed to save the life of the mother is unclear. Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said any number is problematic because abortion data is always incomplete. California, for instance, is one of a few states that does not report the number of abortion procedures that happen there. Hamrick directed us to a blog post written by the group's legal team about limited CDC data and anecdotal evidence of infants born alive, including two Florida cases of infants surviving abortion procedures (one died, one survived with catastrophic injuries) and the trial of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell. The post does not support Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures, offering instead the more nuanced breakdown for the 1,270 figure that we heard from Pigman. Our ruling Yoest said 1,270 infants in 2010 \"were reported to have died following attempted abortions.\" The figure is based on an \"other\" category of perinatal deaths, but it does not mean what she says it means. Included in this category are babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems. We rate her statement False.\n",

            "[Evidences]:South Africans “must be extremely worried” about the number of women being murdered in the country,Minister Nathi Mthethwa“South Africa femicide rate is 5 times more than the global rate,” Mthethwa, the minister ofarts and culture, added. Key findings from the “many surveys which have been done on this matter” included that “in South Africa, every 8 hours a woman is killed and at least half of these women die at the hands of their intimate partners”.Areaderdrew our attention to the claims. Africa Check then contacted Mthethwa’s spokesman to get his source, but at the time of publication, it was outstanding.(Note: Spokesman Lisa Combrinck has since responded, saying: “There is no further need to share the sources with you of the other references you request, as you have gone to similar sources that were used for the most part.”)Claim “In South Africa, every 8 hours a woman is killed...” Verdict incorrectTo get the latest figures on femicide, Africa Check spoke to Major-General Sally de Beer, theSouth African Police Service’s head of corporate communication.Between April and December 2016, the police recorded a total of 14,333 murders, De Beer told Africa Check. Of these, 1,713 were women.This works out to a woman being murdered every 4 hours in South Africa. (Note: When women murdered by intimate partners are considered, the most recent data points to one murder every 8 hours, as we explain next.)Claim “...and at least half of these [murdered] women die at the hands of their intimate partners.” Verdict correctDe Beer told Africa Check that “the crime registrar office of the South African Police Service does not keep intimate-partner-violence statistics, as this is not a legally defined crime”.The most recent data we have on intimate partner femicide in South Africa is based on 2009 autopsy data of women aged 14 years and older from mortuaries across the country.Researchers, mainly from theSouth African Medical Research Council’sGender and Health Research Unit, corroborated the databy interviewingpolice investigators “to verify the cause of death, to identify relationships with perpetrators and to collect other crime investigation data”. The sample of cases was then weighted to be nationally representative.For the study’s purpose, intimate femicide was defined as the murder of women by their “current or ex-husband or boyfriend, same-sex partner or a rejected would-be lover”.Thepublished studyindicated that the police could identify the perpetrator in 1,792 of an estimated 2,363 cases. Of the cases where a perpetrator had been identified, more than half of the murders (57.1%) were by an intimate partner.Though the perpetrator was unknown in 22% of the cases, this was not thought to skew the results significantly, two experts involved with the study told Africa Check.The researchers made the statistical assumption that the perpetrator data was missing at random and that “one would get the more or less the same intimate/non-intimate distribution in the cases with the missing data”, Prof Carl Lombard, director of the MRC’s biostatistics unit and study co-author, said.“There are all sorts of statistical ways to deal with missing data, but if you have the majority of the data... then the results won’t change [in important ways],” Dr Edward Mills told Africa Check. He is associate professor in the department of health research methods, evidence and impact atMcMaster Universityin Canada and edited the journal article.The researchers’ data for 1999showed that in 50.2% of cases where a perpetrator was identified (18.5% of the total), the victim was killed by an intimate partner. These studies “suggest a relatively stable but possibly increasing proportion of intimate partner femicides”, criminologist Anine Kriegler told Africa Check. She is co-author of the book A Citizen’s Guide to Crime Trends in South Africa and based at the University of Cape Town.“This is unlikely to have seen dramatic change,” she noted. “I would say [this claim] qualifies as ‘correct’, given available data.”Claim “South Africa’s femicide rate is 5 times more than the global rate.” Verdict mostly-correctUPDATE: Click here for the most recent data.Stephanie Burrows, a technical officer in the World Health Organisation’sViolence and Injury Prevention programme, told Africa Check that the organisation’s latest murderestimatesprovide data for 2015.the organisation projected murder figures for 2015. Burrows noted that the estimated global rate of femicide for 2015 was 2.4 per 100,000 women. South Africa’s rate for the same year was 9.6 per 100,000 women. This would mean that South Africa’s rate is 4 times that of the global average when considering the latest estimates.When actual data for 2010 is considered, we see that the country’s femicide rate was then 5.1 times higher than the global average.Year SA rate/100,000 women Data source WHO global average rate/100,000 1999 24.7 MRC - 2000 21.4 WHO 3.3 2005 17.3 WHO 2.9 2009 12.9 MRC - 2010 13.4 WHO 2.6 2015 9.6 WHO 2.4The rate of femicides needs to be contextualised within the broader murder rate. Abrahams told Africa Check that a high femicide rate was plausible as we “have high homicide anyway”.TheInstitute for Security Studies’Crime and Justice Information Hubmanager, Lizette Lancaster, added that South Africa’s “murder rates more than halved” between 1994/95 and 2011/12.“Therefore, it is very likely that our femicide rate also decreased. Of course, the overall murder rate increased by almost 13% in the past 4 years.”Additional readingGUIDE: Understanding crime statistics in South Africa – what you need to knowFACTSHEET: South Africa’s crime statistics for April to December 2016UN stats don’t show a rape occurs every 26 seconds in SA, as Sky News reportedCOMMENT: The white right, women’s murders and a massacre of statisticsRacial scare-mongering in South Africa makes light of women’s murdersThe estimates are based on information from several sources, including data provided by countries from police and vital registration sources, data from UNODC’s global studies on homicide and the WHO’s mortality database.

            "claim [Claim]: Says Travis County’s sheriff refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373.\n",
            "[Evidences]:Greg Abbott, who shut off about $1.5 million in grants to Travis County out of concern that the county’s Democratic officials unduly shield unauthorized immigrants, subsequently accused the local sheriff of breaking a federal law. The Republican governor said in a Feb. 6, 2017, tweet: \"Sheriff violates oath by refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 & not giving ICE info about drugs cartels & armed robbers.\" ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that focuses on battling the illegal movement of people and trade. Abbott didn’t offer factual back-up for his charge. Separately, Wes Priddy of the sheriff’s department told us by phone there’s been no change in operations that would violate the cited law. \"I don’t know where the governor is getting his information or his point of view. I suspect it’s just conjecture,\" Priddy said. Let’s recap the federal provisions singled out by Abbott before getting to the policy put in place by Sheriff Sally Hernandez and whether she’s not enforcing the law. Federal law Abbott did not single out any law pertaining to local police agencies accepting or refusing \"detainer\" requests from federal authorities seeking a hold on inmates so agents can consider them for deportation. Instead, the governor’s tweet refers to a 216-word law that’s focused on easing the flow of information between federal immigration authorities and local law agencies. Titled \"Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service,\" the 1990s law bars federal, state or local agencies or officials from restricting any agency or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities \"information regarding the citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\" Also, the law bars any person or agency from restricting another government entity from sending, requesting, receiving or maintaining information about any individual’s immigration status or exchanging such information with a government entity. Travis County policy We don’t know why Abbott concluded Hernandez isn’t enforcing those provisions. He didn’t say and an aide, Matt Hirsch, didn’t reply to our inquiry. But Abbott posted his tweet about three hours after a commentary piece by Hernandez was posted by the Austin American-Statesman. In the commentary, Hernandez, a Democrat elected sheriff in November 2016, defended her policy of not automatically honoring every federal request to detain immigrant inmates for up to 48 hours—with the exception of inmates charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Other inmates, she said, would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez wrote: \"Our policies at the Travis County sheriff’s office are centered on all legal statutes and principles that are applicable to all. We proudly stand by our Constitution and our laws and plan to continue doing so. We will also continue to legally comply with\" ICE, she wrote. A few days later, Hernandez posted a statement on the office’s website saying in part: \"I am following all state and federal laws, and upholding constitutional rights to due process for all in our criminal justice system. Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated.\" Travis County official We asked Priddy, who oversees the county’s correctional complex,if thenew policy restricts the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott. Priddy told us there’s been no change in the flow of each inmate’s vital information to other law enforcement agencies including ICE. That is, Priddy said, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted and that information along with the person’s name and date of birth is conveyed electronically to the Texas Department of Public Safety and then, he said, to federal agencies including ICE, whose officers can then determine if a suspect merits their attention. According to the DPS, its Automated Fingerprint Information System stores the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals. Also, Priddy said, ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation. \"If so, we share and allow,\" Priddy said, though he said ICE officers don’t have unfettered access to inmates in the jail’s intake area, which they once did. \"We are complying\" with 8 USC 1373, Priddy said, adding: \"We are allowing ICE the opportunity to interview inmates; we are providing them information on their requests, just as we are with any other agency.\" We noticed, though,the sheriff’s policy includes a provision that seemingly could fetter information flow. It states that sheriff’s office \"officials shall not conduct or initiate any immigration status investigation into individuals in TCSO custody or provide information on an inmate’s release date or address to ICE.\" Asked about that, Priddy said by email: \"The segments you are referring to are there to ensure TCSO staff do not conduct their own investigation regarding someone’s immigration status. Information regarding citizenship or immigration status is readily shared with ICE upon that agency’s request.\" ICE focuses on detainers Next, we asked an ICE spokeswoman, Nina Pruneda, to evaluate Abbott’s claim. Prunedo, by email, sent an agency statement that didn’t touch on any law explicitly: \"ICE would welcome any changes to current policy that would allow local authorities to more fully cooperate with ICE toward achieving the shared goal of protecting public safety and national security while balancing important community policing needs,\" ICE said.\"When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders onto the streets, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission,\" ICE said. Immigration experts We also asked immigration experts from different vantage points about the accuracy of Abbott’s claim. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggested the sheriff’s policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person’s release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. By email, Vaughan pointed out a 2016 Justice Department memo that led us to an explanation of 8 USC 1373 by the Republican-majority House Judiciary Committee. That 1996 explanation says the panel’s intent was to \"give state and local officials the authority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence, whereabouts and activities of illegal aliens.\" (After 9/11, Congress dissolved the Immigration and Naturalization Service with ICE assuming some of its duties.) \"This section,\" the committee said, \"is designed to prevent any state or local law, ordinance, executive order, policy, constitutional provision or decision of any federal or state court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communication between state and local officials and the INS.\" We also heard back from Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which has as its mission working with and educating immigrants, community organizations and the legal sector to continue to build a democratic society that values diversity and the rights of all people. Generally, Graber commented by email, the sheriff’s policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn’t extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with the law highlighted by Abbott, she said. Sheriff revised policy Graber also underscored a section of the sheriff’s policy that wasn’t initially there, we noticed. The added section, point No. 10 in the policy, tracks with 8 USC 1373, stating: \"This policy in no way prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual’s immigration or citizenship status, and nothing in this policy shall be construed to prohibit or restrict TCSO personnel from exchanging information regarding the immigration or citizenship status of any individual with ICE.\" We asked the sheriff’s office why the section was added. By email, spokeswoman Kristen Dark replied that the provision was added Jan. 31, 2017 \"in the interest of clarity.\" Simultaneously, Dark wrote, another part of the policy was expanded, in part with: \"Information regarding incarceration status of inmates is available on the TCSO website. Information regarding court dates is available on the Travis County Courts’ website.\" Those sentences were inserted in front of an existing declaration about department personnel not using resources to help enforce federal immigration laws. Our ruling Abbott said Sheriff Hernandez refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373. Given the sheriff’s policy against automatically granting federal requests to detain immigrant-inmates or using personnel to enforce immigration laws, we can see how someone might speculate about the sheriff not enforcing, or complying with, the cited law about easing the flow of information about immigration or citizenship statuses. But Abbott didn't back up his claim, which also wasn’t explicitly borne out by ICE. Notably too, the sheriff's policy was expanded before Abbott leveled his claim to specify that it shouldn't be read as slowing or stopping any information flow between office personnel and ICE regarding the legal status of individuals. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

            "[Evidences]:\"In 2021, if someone gets admitted to the hospital with #COVID19 -- and dies -- without having been treated with some combination of Vitamin D, zinc, IVM, HCQ, steroids, Azithromycin and blood thinners -- they didn't die from COVID; they died from malpractice. #FactsNotFear,\" says a September 26, 2021 tweet from an account said to belong to a doctor. More examples of the post -- part of a trend of inaccurate information circulating online about how to prevent and treat Covid-19 -- appeared on Instagram here and here. Hydroxychloroquine, abbreviated in the posts as \"HCQ,\" is an anti-malarial drug that was favored by former president Donald Trump as a Covid-19 treatment, despite no strong evidence of real-world efficacy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked the Emergency Use Authorization for using hydroxychloroquine to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients in June 2020, citing safety issues including \"serious heart rhythm problems... blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.\" And the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \"recommends against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin for the treatment of Covid-19 in hospitalized patients and in nonhospitalized patients,\" according to the agency website. Anti-parasitic drug ivermectin -- \"IVM\" in the social media posts -- showed promise in early lab settings but has so far failed to translate into real-world success, as judged by its lack of clear efficacy in trials. The NIH Covid-19 treatment guidelines say there is not enough evidence \"either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19\" until clear results become available from rigorous trials. Ivermectin is approved by the FDA to treat people with certain conditions caused by parasitic worms, but the agency has warned against using it for Covid-19. A physician confirmed that scientific findings do not support treating hospitalized Covid-19 patients with a combination of vitamin D, zinc, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, azithromycin and blood thinners, and that doing so may actually harm the patient. Texas A&M College of Medicine's Robert Carpenter said: \"I am aware of no reliable scientific data showing a benefit of taking these agents individually or clustered as described above in prevention or 'curing' of Covid-19. In fact, taking these agents in combination with other chronic medications can be quite dangerous.\" He noted that the medicines listed in the post are safe and effective at \"helping patients overcome the diseases for which their medical providers intended their use\" and \"Vitamin D and zinc supplements when taken in approved doses can be essential to helping individuals maintain health.\" But \"most of the agents promoted in the original social media post can cause significant harm when taken in unrecommended forms, or at elevated dosages, or for prolonged periods of time outside the advice of a one's qualified health care team,\" Carpenter said. The NIH Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel says there is not enough evidence for it to recommend for or against the use of zinc or Vitamin D to treat Covid-19, and that it advises against taking more supplemental zinc than the recommended dietary allowance to prevent the disease. Some corticosteroids -- a type of anti-inflammatory drug commonly referred to as steroids -- are recommended for certain Covid-19 patients, the NIH panel says, depending on patient severity and other factors. And a large clinical trial found that \"full-dose blood thinners\" helped moderately ill Covid-19 patients, but not severely ill ones, the NIH said. A separate study found the antibiotic azithromycin no more effective than a placebo in preventing Covid-19 symptons. Carpenter said the best way to prevent severe Covid-19 illness, hospitalization and death is to get a Covid-19 vaccine, which \"have been proven to be safe and are extremely effective at preventing clinically significant Covid-19.\" \"The science is solid,\" he said. Loyola University School of Law professor Nadia Sawicki, who specializes in health law, said that a physician has legally \"committed malpractice if their treatment of a patient does not conform to the customary practices in the medical community as a whole.\" \"Unless a significant community of physicians and hospitals treating Covid patients routinely rely on this combination of treatments as the standard of care, failing to provide those treatments would not constitute malpractice,\" she said. Health law professor Leslie Wolf said that nuance, including taking into account the patient's condition, is also key to determining if malpractice has been committed. Although \"recommendations of expert bodies\" such as the NIH are helpful, they are not necessarily \"determinative, as there can be more than one reasonable approach.\" Boston University School of Law professor Christopher Robertson said that the since the treatments described by the posts are not the standard of care, \"physicians have no legal obligation to provide them.\" In fact, the opposite could be true. \"Because these treatments are not typically used by mainstream physicians or supported by the scientific literature, if a physician... uses them and it leads to a bad outcome, the physician may well face malpractice liability or professional discipline from their licensure agency,\" he said.

            "[Evidences]:A series of low-resolution photos purportedly showing the “world’s largest anaconda” have been circulating online since at least 2010: Although these images seemingly show a very large snake being transported on the back of a truck, higher resolution versions of these photos reveal that the items pictured are just toys: These images were created for a student project entitled “Vietnam Army caught the giant snake” in 2010. While it’s possible that the students used a real (but dead) snake for some of the photographs, the animalpictured was definitely not the “world’s biggest anaconda.” The snake also didn’t catch a rocket in its teeth: Or get run over by tanks: Although mostof the photographs included withthe “world’s largest anaconda” rumor came from the student project displayed above, another image purportedly showing theenormous (yet fictional) snake originated with a YouTube video published in 2012: While we haven’t been able to determine how the image featured in the above-displayed video was created, we have been able to determine that it is fake based on two factors. First, the video claims that the snake is at least 75 feet long (which is more than twice the size of the largest snake on record), and second, the video was uploaded by a cryptozoologist (Marc Anders) who frequently employs digital manipulation to speculate about the existence of creatures such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster. In June 2015, a story containing oddly specific details (e.g., how could the number of animals this snake had killed be known?) was attached to these pictures: The world’s largest Anaconda was caught in Amazon forest. This snake had eaten 257 people & 2325 animals. It is 134 feet long and 2067 kg. This anaconda was caught alive by a long struggle after 37 days and killed by the Royal British commando force. In July 2015, a different fake photograph was attached to the very same claims (i.e., the giant reptile had eaten “257 people and 2325 animals”) by the web site Information Nigeria. Similar to the above-displayed images, Information Nigeria manipulated a photograph of a regular-sized snake to make it appear as if it were the “world’s largest snake”: This claim contains several giveaways beyond the obviously manipulated photographs. Most obviously, a 134-foot-long snake is more than four times longerthan the world’s largest snake, the Green Anaconda, which (according to National Geographic) can reach a length ofabout 30 feet. Even Titanoboa, the enormous Cretaceousfossil discovered in 2012, topped out at under 50feet.\n",

            "[Evidences]:Israel led the world with its COVID-19 vaccination campaign, launching in December 2020 and quickly vaccinating the majority of those over age 60. Because of its early vaccine rollout, the country has been a bellwether for COVID-19 immunization outcomes. So the world took notice when COVID-19 cases began to rise this summer among vaccinated Israelis, and vaccine critics took aim. \"Thanks to (Israel's) sacrifice, we now know that natural immunity is far superior with 1% experiencing re-infection while 40% of new cases were previously vx'd,\" read one viral Facebook post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The figures in the statement appear to be based on media reports, but they lack important context. As of late July, vaccinated people represented a higher percentage of new COVID-19 cases in Israel than those who are unvaccinated. But among Israelis who were fully vaccinated and experienced breakthrough infections, the COVID-19 vaccine was 88% effective in preventing the need for hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness. Comparing reinfection rates to gauge protection against the virus, as the claim does, ignores the dangers of contracting COVID-19, which is how natural immunity occurs. Israel’s data from January and July shows the differences in risk for an unvaccinated and vaccinated population. In January, when the country’s vaccine campaign was still in its early stages and infections were peaking, there were 1,100 patients in serious condition. On July 25 — with the country facing a new outbreak fueled by the delta variant, but with more than 60% of its population vaccinated — serious cases numbered 101. In January, Israel recorded 1,471 deaths from COVID-19, compared with 49 deaths in the month ended Aug. 2. Now, about 1.6% of cases in Israel become critically ill, compared with 4% during an earlier wave of cases when vaccine coverage was low, according to a tweet by Eran Segal, a scientist at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science who tracks COVID-19 data. The Facebook post was an image of a July 17 tweet by Del Bigtree, chief executive officer of Informed Consent Action Network, a U.S. anti-vaccination group, who has spread misinformation before. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bigtree has made misleading claims about the risks to children of wearing masks and spread other false claims about the virus. A Facebook post claimed, \"Thanks to (Israel's) sacrifice, we now know that natural immunity is far superior with 1% experiencing re-infection while 40% of new cases were previously vx'd.\" The figures lack important context. Calling natural immunity \"far superior\" ignores the dangers of contracting COVID-19, which is how natural immunity occurs. And the claim ignores the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalization and severe illness. Data shows that among Israelis who experienced breakthrough infections, COVID-19 vaccines were 88% effective against hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness. And with a majority of its population vaccinated, Israel has seen huge reductions in serious cases and deaths. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says 50 percent of millennials don’t associate with \"any political party.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Millennials are not big fans of professing commitment, according to a recent poll. They’re not ready to declare a lifelong love for a political party (or a spouse, for that matter). In Facebook lingo, they might say \"It’s complicated\" or claim to be in an open relationship with political parties. \"They should call us the ‘party pooper’ generation,\" tweeted Rock the Vote, an organization focused on increasing young registered voters, on March 11, 2014. \"50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party.\" After hearing about the youth vote helping elect President Barack Obama, we wondered if that statistic could be correct: Do half of millennials not associate with a political party? Identification and voting aren’t the same In the tweet, Rock the Vote linked to a study released by Pew Research Center in March. Pew conducted the telephone survey of 1,821 adults nationwide in February, including 617 millennials ages 18 to 33, and analyzed previous surveys. This survey asked a variety of questions, ranging from whether they know what a \"selfie\" is to their thoughts on the tea party. As for millennials, Pew concluded: \"They are relatively unattached to organized politics and religion, linked by social media, burdened by debt, distrustful of people, in no rush to marry — and optimistic about the future.\" The survey showed that 50 percent of millennials describe themselves as political independents, up from 38 percent in 2004. Meanwhile, 27 percent identify as Democrats and 17 percent as Republicans. But a follow-up question shows how they tilt: The 50 percent who self-identified as independents were then asked if they leaned more to either party. Among those 50 percent, 44 percent lean Democratic and 31 percent lean Republican. That leaves about 25 percent who either mentioned another party or say they are independents and don’t lean. When Pew included \"leaners,\" they found that half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican. A Democratic leaner \"behaves like a Democrat, thinks like a Democrat, votes like a Democrat,\" John Petrocik, a University of Missouri political science professor, told PolitiFact Florida. Many voting experts told us that when stated in isolation, describing half of millennials as independents is misleading because it omits their partisan leanings and voting behavior. \"A substantial proportion of self-described independents vote consistently Democratic or Republican; they just don’t like to use a party label,\" said Peter Levine, professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts. \"True independents -- those who really don’t know which party they’ll support -- are few, and they tend to have low turnout.\" In the past, millennials have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. In 2008, 66 percent of voters age 18-29 voted for Obama -- that fell to 60 percent in 2012. Other surveys The Pew survey isn’t the only recent poll to look at millennial party identification. A 2012 survey done by American National Election Studies, a collaboration of Stanford University and the University of Michigan, divided respondents into strong and not very strong Democrats and Republicans; independents who lean Democratic or Republican; and flat out independent. Not surprisingly the number of true independents drops -- and it’s far below 50 percent for respondents ages 18-33. Strong Democrat 16.47% Not very strong Democrat 19.77% Independent-Democrat 11.81% All Democrats and leaners 48.05% Independent 16.36% Independent-Republican 11.26% Not very strong Republican 13.37% Republican 10.96% All Republicans and leaners 35.59% Partisan leanings and voting behavior, \"demonstrate quite clearly that millennials are by far the most Democratic age group in the American electorate today,\" said Alan I. Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. Independents in Florida So what about here in Florida, where about 25 percent of the electorate is independent? In the ages 18-29 category, 40 percent were registered Democrat, 27 percent Republican and 29 percent no party affiliation as of August 2012, according to University of South Florida professor Susan MacManus. \"They see themselves as neither (Democrat or Republican) but when push comes to shove, depending on the candidate, they tend to lean Democratic,\" MacManus told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Rock the Vote said \"50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party.\" The group quoted a Pew study that showed half of millennials don’t self-identify with either major political party. However, that statement could create a misleading impression that their vote is up for grabs and they have no leanings, and that’s not the case. Half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican, Pew found. Other data and polling experts suggest millennials lean decisively toward Democrats, even when they identify as independents. We rate this claim Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"Since President Obama took office, over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:Jobs numbers are among the most common statistics used in political claims because they have proven to be a potent issue in campaigns.Americans for Tax Reform -- the group led by Grover Norquist that is best known for its Taxpayer Protection Pledge opposing all tax increases -- makes a jobs number the most prominent claim in a brochure it mailed to Ohio voters this month.\"Since President Obama took office, over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs,\" the brochure states in large type. It links the figure to \"wasted spending\" by the federal government and \"not enough jobs.\" PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim. The brochure cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment statistics, as the source for its figure. PolitiFact Ohio contacted Americans for Tax Reform. Its staff said it specifically used the area unemployment statistics for Ohio from January 2009, the month Obama was inaugurated, and July 2012, the most recent figure that was available on Aug. 29, the day it accessed the data. The BLS table shows that there were 5,440,511 employed Ohioans in January 2009, and 5,351,943 employed in July.Simple subtraction shows 88,568 fewer employed Ohioans, a net loss of jobs that backs up ATR's claim.But fully understanding the ATR claim requires putting that number in context. As the mailer says, \"it’s important for Ohio to get the whole picture.\"In this case, context is important because the brochure criticizes Obama for what it says is wasteful spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the ‘stimulus,’ that didn’t yield jobs that were promised.It urges voters to call the president and \"tell him to help the economy by cutting government spending and reducing taxes, and urge him to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.\"Some background will help: The Great Recession started in December 2007, before Obama took office, and had its official end in June 2009.Job losses in Ohio started in February 2008 and continued every month until December 2009, when Ohio employment hit bottom, according to BLS data. Almost twice as many jobs were lost in Ohio in the year before Obama's inauguration -- 173,632 -- as happened on his watch, in the time frame used by ATR's brochure.Because Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office. That month also was when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- the stimulus specifically cited in the brochure -- was signed into law, on Feb. 17, 2009.That’s important to know because ATR surrounds the job-loss claim with examples of stimulus projects to bolster the notion of wasteful spending. The timeline ATR used for job losses in Ohio predates the stimulus law by a month.Using the February figure of 5,414,966 working Ohioans reduces the total job losses through July 2012 to 63,023, more than 28 percent below the claim in ATR's brochure.Why such a big difference? The months surrounding the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included some of the most rapid job losses of the recession.Meanwhile, a seasonal comparison of employment figures, from July 2009 (the first month after the official end of the recession) to July 2012, actually shows Ohio has added more than 42,000 jobs.It's worth noting that several other figures also appear on the BLS table. They show the number of unemployed Ohioans dropping by 93,472 -- from 511,409 to 417,937 -- between January 2009 and July 2012. Ohio’s labor force also shrank in that period, from 5,951,920 to 5,769,880.The unemployment rate, which hit its low of 10.6 percent in July 2009, dropped from 8.6 percent in January 2009 to 7.2 percent last July.So where does that leave the Americans for Tax Reform claim that 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs since Obama took office?The statement is partially accurate. It correctly cites the number of jobs lost in Ohio between January 2009, the month Obama was sworn in, and July 2012.But including January in that count also means including a month in which Obama was not president for the first two-thirds of it. And it includes a month and one-half of time that predates enactment of the stimulus law, something the brochure clearly is targeting.And the statement ignores the trend line of an economy that was hemorrhaging jobs when Obama took office but began heading upward, albeit slowly. Ohio hasn’t recovered all the jobs lost since January 2009. But there are 96,000 more Ohioans working now than in December of that year. And Ohio’s unemployment rate, which through July has fallen for 12 straight months.Those are important details that provide context needed to fully understand the ATR claim.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Says Libya \"Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens sent 600 requests for help\" in Benghazi.\n",
            "[Evidences]:The death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens came up as a topic during the second presidential debate Sunday night. When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Donald Trump if tweeting about a sex tape between 3 and 5 a.m. reflected the discipline of a good leader, Trump denied using those words and suddenly veered onto the subject of the 2012 attack on the mission compound in Benghazi, Libya. Security was inadequate and Stevens died of smoke inhalation from a fire during an attack by insurgents. Trump, apparently thinking that the drama unfolded at 3 a.m. in Washington, started referring to a famous Hillary Clinton commercial from her 2008 run for president, which argued that she was the best person for responding to a national emergency, as represented by a hypothetical 3 a.m. phone call to the White House. Trump: \"She said, 'Who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?' Guess what? She didn't answer because ... Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.\" It’s hard to overstate how much is wrong here. The attack on the compound actually began at 9:42 p.m. in Libya, which was 3:42 p.m. in Washington. By 3 a.m. in Washington the following day, the attacks were over, and the people involved had either left Benghazi or were less than an hour from being flown out. So for this fact-check, we're going to focus on whether Stevens made 600 requests for help. Trump's cryptic comment might be heard as suggesting that Stevens made 600 \"requests for help\" during the attack. The investigations of Benghazi show that didn't happen. In fact, when we contacted the Trump campaign, they referred us to a graph that claimed something very different. First, there's no debate that security at the mission was inadequate and that requests for improvements stalled or rejected. Some security improvements were made the year of the attack, including \"heightening the perimeter wall, installing concrete Jersey barriers, mounting safety grills on the safe area windows, and other minor improvements,\" according to a 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. But while the CIA was making significant upgrades to its nearby annex, similar improvements were not being done at the Benghazi mission. The CIA annex had nine security officers, but only three officers were assigned to the mission complex. A month before the attack, with the security situation deteriorating, Army Gen. Carter Ham, who was head of U.S. Africa Command, twice offered to give the U.S. embassy in Tripoli a special military security team. Stevens declined the offer. No reason was given, but it may have had to do with the State Department not wanting to aggravate the political instability in Libya with the presence of U.S. forces. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Dan Kowalski cited this chart, which was displayed during hearings by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi. But there's no reference to this chart in the report itself, released months later. Democrats on the committee, in their minority report, said that, \"During our hearing with Secretary Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan) argued that the Select Committee had obtained ‘over 600 requests’ for security from Benghazi, but he refused to provide the evidence for his claim.\" The minority report continues, \"Democrats have been unable to successfully reconstruct a list of 600 requests for additional security, and have been able to identify fewer than 200 requests, many of which were granted.\" A few things are worth noting right off the bat. • The Republicans’ count is 569, not 600, accumulated over nine months. • Stevens wasn't sworn in as ambassador to Libya until May 2012. So even if every one of those requests/concerns originated from Stevens and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600. • The count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton, as Trump said. This can get ambiguous because such correspondence is often sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. As Clinton noted during her Jan. 23, 2013, testimony on the Benghazi attack, \"1.43 million cables a year come to the State Department. They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy.\" It's also not clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or were security-related requests involving the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well. Earlier this year, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into the 600 number, which was being cited by Trump and others. He found duplication. Once a request is made it can be followed by one or more statements of \"concern\" on the same topic, so there's a lot of overlap in the count. The Postwas given only a cursory look at the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, but he noted that one subject heading was repeated 17 times, suggesting that the same request was being repeatedly discussed. That alone may have inflated the total. To properly check whether the same security-related requests were being reported under different subject headings, the committee would have to release the documents. At the time, Kessler was reporting that the committee's final report \"is supposed to list the documents that formed the basis of the 600 figure.\" We contacted the committee twice and received no response. If we get additional information, we'll update this fact-check. In any event, Kessler noted, \"few if any\" requests were likely from Stevens. He called Trump's comment \"a whopper.\" Our ruling Trump said \"Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.\" There certainly were many requests for security improvements at the mission. But Trump goes way over the line, citing a graph that includes a period when Stevens wasn't even the ambassador and doesn't differentiate between actual requests for improved security and follow-up correspondence. The highest the number could be, according to that data, is 205 and there's no evidence that those \"requests and concerns\" — which may include duplicates — were even sent by Stevens. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63594c70-fdef-4c85-8495-89eb8f90c67c\n",

            "claim [Claim]: \"We’ve saved over $100 million of (health care) costs\" in Milwaukee County. \"I did that.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:A special election for Milwaukee County executive will be held in April 2011, which means that before long, boasts from politicians will be as common as tattoos on basketball players.The five candidates include Lee Holloway, the County Board chairman who became acting county executive in December after Scott Walker resigned to become governor.Holloway, in a Jan. 12, 2011 meeting with Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, tried for a three-point basket with a boast about the county’s health care expenditures.\"We’ve saved over $100 million of costs,\" he declared, then added for emphasis: \"I did that.\"Has the county really saved more than $100 million on its health care bills? And does Holloway deserve all the credit?In making his claim, Holloway traced the health care savings to 2006, when the County Board moved to undo changes made by the Walker administration.Let’s take a look at the sequence of events.January 2006: Contract implemented.A four-year contract negotiated by the Walker administration with Madison-based WPS Health Insurance, the county’s third-party administrator for health care, takes effect. It moved the county from being self-insured to fully insured.Early 2006: Problems surface.County staff inform the County Board’s Finance and Audit Committee, which requested monthly reports on health care costs, that the county’s 2006 health care costs were projected to exceed the budget by $7.3 million.Based on a recommendation by the committee, a work group of county employees is formed. Its job is to reduce health care expenses by pursuing changes in, or even termination of, the 4-month-old WPS contract.October 2006: Staff, contract changes.The County Board approves a Holloway proposal to create a Division of Employee Benefits to manage health care and pension benefits. The aim is to build expertise in those areas in order to lower costs.The county also reverts back to the self-insured model for health care through negotiations with WPS. The change is retroactive to January 2006.November-December 2006: More changes.The County Board approves a resolution by Holloway and other supervisors to create an advisory committee to help find health care cost savings.Stuart Piltch -- a consultant hired by the county to help with a pension lawsuit -- is enlisted to help find savings. That recommendation came from county staff attorneys.Beginning in 2006, the County Board led labor negotiations that resulted in increased co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance for employees.January 2009: Contract canceled.The county persuades WPS to release it from the four-year contract one year early. The county then signs a new agreement with UnitedHealthcare, which saved $30 million in one year alone, according to Dave Arena, the first director of the new county employee benefits unit.(Holloway credited Arena with helping achieve health care cost savings, but fired him without explanation in January 2011 after becoming acting county executive.)Those were the major health care changes.So, how much money did the county save? From 2006 through 2010, an estimated $130 million, according to calculations by the county auditor’s office and the employee benefits division.That doesn’t mean the county health care bill is dropping. The $123.7 million the county spent in 2006 dropped by 1 percent in 2007, county figures show. But since then it has risen each year to the $139.6 million that was budgeted for 2010.What Holloway meant is that the county spent an estimated $130 million less on health care than it would have if the county remained in the fully insured plan that was put in place by Walker.Now, how much credit for the savings does Holloway deserve?The consensus among seven key figures we interviewed was that many people were involved in achieving the savings. But the view also was that Holloway took most of the leadership role, while the Walker administration played more of a supportive role.A spokesman for Walker declined comment.Holloway’s major public initiative was the new employee benefits division. That gave the county expertise to negotiate the early release from the WPS contract and to bargain a less expensive deal with UnitedHealthcare. The county estimates the change saved nearly $49 million.Holloway’s other contributions were behind the scenes.According to county auditor Jerome Heer, Holloway’s leadership was crucial in boosting employee contributions for health benefits, which saved an estimated $44 million.Heer also said that if Holloway had not made reducing health care expenses a priority, the county would have stayed with the costlier fully insured plan put in place by Walker. Changing from fully insured to self insured saved an estimated $37 million.Offering a different view were County Supervisor Paul Cesarz and former supervisor Richard Nyklewicz. They said the savings were achieved through collaborative efforts of Holloway, the County Board, county staff and others.So, how do we size all of this up?County figures support Holloway’s claim that the county saved more than $100 million on health care bills -- in terms of what it would have spent had changes not been made. As for credit, no one argues that Holloway dug into the nuts and bolts of the changes the county made. As the County Board chairman, Holloway’s role was leadership, and he played a key -- though far from solo -- role.To put it another way:Holloway didn’t dribble the basketball the full length of the court before taking his shot -- he got an assist from his teammates. But his shot did go in. We rate his statement Mostly True.\n",

            "[Evidences]:On 16 March 2016, Ed Trice wrote a long post on LinkedIn describing his purported battle to havehis daughter’s standardized math test results changed, as well as the results of all similar tests in the U.S. changed, after her supposedly “correct” answer to the question “What’s the largest number you can represent with 3 digits?” marked wrong: This post is about my fight against “Standardized Testing” in math, and what later became “Common Core.” It goes back to 2008 when my daughter was in grade school. I got a call to come to the principal’s office. I was surprised, as this was a real first. Like all fathers I suppose, we tend to think of our little girls as angelic and saintlike. In my case, this was the absolute truth. <!–Right at the outset the details of this narrative are sketchy, because Trice reports that this educational showdown occurred in 2008 butstill laidblame on the Common Core curriculum. TheCouncil of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center), however, didn't develop the standards until 2009.–> “Your daughter was being disruptive in class.” It was like an arrow through my heart. I looked over at her. There were tear-streaked marks all down her face. She looked down at her shoes when I shot a glance over at her. And she started sobbingagain. The principal continued his monotone diatribe, while I walked over to kneel besides my daughter and hug her. “Really, Mr. Trice, that’s not appropriate …” “Your daughter tried to correct her math teacher. The teacher explained why she was wrong, and she insisted that she was correct.” I laughed. I knew she was right and the teacher was wrong. I couldn’t wait to hear this one. The first few paragraphs of Trice’s story serve to set up the confrontation: Not really between Ed Trice and his daughter’s teacher,but between the reader and Common Core system. Trice immediately paints the school’s principal as the story’s villain, a feckless man who censured Trice’s “disruptive” daughter for daring to challenge the answer to a test question and chastised her father for attempting to comfort her with a hug. “What was the question?” I asked as the principal was about to interject a rebuke to my outburst. The teacher was also present, and he spoke up. “The question was, what was the largest number that can be represented with 3 digits. I said it was 999, your daughter disagreed.” I remember thinking “Uh-oh. What the heck was she thinking?” That’s when she spoke up, anger in her voice, “Oh yeah? Tell me what 9 raised to the 9th power raised to the 9th power is then??” Holy crap! She was right! Technically, the problemis not asking for the largest 3-digit number, which is exactly where my mind went upon hearing the question. The question is asking you to represent a number using 3 digits, so exponentiation cannot be ruled out. I looked over at her and smiled and said “Way to go! You’re 100% correct!” And I gave her a high-five. She smiled. Then cried some tears of joys as she laughed. She knew I had her back. The question of whether Ed Trice’s daughter was “100% correct” as described in this account is far from a settled one. One could argue that exponentiation is a form of multiplication and therefore uses operators as well as digits (even if the former are only implied), leaving the door open for all sorts of answers that would produce even larger numbers, such as 9!^9!^9!. As well, one might contend that the question specified the use of digits, but a value expressed as an exponential employs numbers rather than digits. In fact, this very question (i.e., about the largest number that can be represented with three digits) has been posted to math forums since at least 2002, including versions that present it (just as Trice did) as a scenario involving a student’s challenging his teacher, making it highly unlikely Trice just happened to experience the very same event, in the very same setting, several years later. Regardless of what the correct answer might be, Trice claims that he argued with administrators and managed to get them to change his daughter’s score on the standardized test, as well as the scores of everyother student in the country who took the same test: “Mr. Trice, the only way I can give your daughter credit for that one answer,” (and he really put emphasis on one) “is to go to the national board of education and have everyone who took this test have their answers marked incorrect.” Amazingly, he thought that would make me want to back down. “OK. Do it.” The three of them were mid-stance, not yet fully risen from their seats, and they froze. “Beg pardon?” asked the superintendent. “I said, do it. As in, make it happen. As in, execute that course of action.” They sat back down. The next hour involved them trying to persuade me against it. Finally, they started the concessions. My daughter would be given a score of 100 instead of 99, but the others would not be penalized. After all, this was two months later, etc. etc. etc. “No. I gave you that option already and it was declined. I want every exam in the country marked incorrect that has 999 as the correct answer.” It took an attorney and another 3 months, but I got the result. My daughter scored the only 100 on the exam that year for her grade, not just in her class, but in the country. I didn’t care what it cost. I didn’t care how much effort it took. I didn’t care that an entire federal department was given tens of thousands of hours of work in addition to the demands placed on it. I cared that an individual who had the ability to shape my daughter’s future mind made her cry when she was right and he was wrong and he knew it. This could have been handled so much better by the overlords. Again, this account is highly suspect, because national standardized tests are typically graded at central facilities operated by the companies that produce the tests; it isn’t within the purview of an individual local school teacher or official to change the score assigned to any student. And if this account were true andEd Trice really forced “an entire federal department” to devote“tens of thousands of hours of work” to fixing a single standardized test question (even though private companies, not the federal government, typically produce such tests), that’s a story that should have made the news. Yet we couldn’t find a single article mentioning Ed Trice’s battle with standardized testing prior to his 16 March 2016 LinkedIn post. Several of the inconsistencies we’ve detailedhere (e.g., that the story has nothing to do with the Common Core curriculum, that the answer to the question under dispute is debatable, that no extant news articles mention any such legal battle) have been pointed out on Trice’s LinkedIn page,but he has steadfastly maintained that his story is 100% accurate. Of course, he has also steadfastly declined to provide any proof: \n",

            "[Evidences]:A viral post on Twitter (currently rebranding as X), which has also been posted multiple times on Facebook , makes a number of incorrect claims about London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ). The ULEZ is an area in London where owners of vehicles which don't match specific emissions standards must pay to drive. The zone currently covers all areas within the city's North and South Circular Roads, but is set to be expanded to cover the entire Greater London area from 29 August 2023. The post says: \"UK citizens are furious Sadiq Khan is installing ULEZ (Ultra low emission zones) recognition cameras throughout London. Those who can't afford electric vehicles will be fined £12 pounds ($15) every time they drive past them. Citizens are fighting back by taking them down as soon as they're installed.\" Posts like this can spread quickly online and affect a person's understanding of how ULEZ is being implemented. False claims about which vehicles are compliant are likely to cause unnecessary worry and may harm public debate about such schemes. It is important to check whether information is clear and accurate before sharing it online. We have previously fact checked misleading claims about the political process behind the expansion of ULEZ,whether exemptions exist for visits to houses of worship and inaccurate suggestions that no public consultation on the scheme ever took place. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in Emissions standards Fully electric vehicles do not produce any emissions and are therefore wholly exempt from ULEZ charges. However, most petrol cars registered since 2005 , light vans registered since 2006 and motorcycles registered since 2007 have engines that produce levels of emissions that are low enough to enable them to comply with ULEZ. Diesel cars registered after September 2015 are also fully compliant, as are diesel vans sold after September 2016. According to figures released by Transport for London (TfL), as of March 2023, more than 90% of vehicles seen driving in outer London on an average day meet the ULEZ standard . However, the RAC has warned that drivers of nearly 700,000 cars in greater London could be liable to pay the charge once the zone expands Penalty charges The post claims that drivers with non-compliant vehicles will be \"fined\" £12 each time they drive past a ULEZ camera. This is incorrect. Non-compliant vehicles entering the ULEZ zone are required to pay a charge of £12.50 per day . This charge remains the same regardless of how many times a vehicle enters the zone or what distance is driven. Failure to pay the charge can lead to a fixed penalty charge notice (PCN) being issued. The penalty charge is £180 but this is reduced to £90 if the outstanding amount is paid within 14 days. A spokesperson for TfL told Full Fact: \"To be clear, people who drive a non-compliant vehicle within the ULEZ must pay a £12.50 driving charge per day. Drivers can check whether their vehicle is non-compliant, view maps of the ULEZ and pay the charge here . \"Most petrol vehicles under 16 years old or diesel vehicles under 6 years old already meet the emissions standards.\" Vandalised cameras Some versions of the posts contain video clips showing a masked member of the public apparently removing ULEZ cameras from their mounts. We have not verified the contents of these videos. As of 1 August the Metropolitan Police Service had recorded 288 crimes relating to ULEZ cameras, including 185 reports of cables being damaged, 164 cameras being stolen and 38 reports of cameras being obscured. In some cases, multiple offences have been linked to a single camera, such as a cable being damaged and the device subsequently stolen. A spokesperson for TfL said there are currently 1,900 ULEZ cameras in place in outer London with a further 850 due to be installed. The spokesperson added: \"Vandalism on our network is unacceptable and all incidents are reported to the police for investigation. We have increased the security of the ULEZ cameras following further incidents of vandalism and theft. The Met has been clear that this is vandalism of government property and is a criminal offence which could lead to prosecution.\" Image courtesy of Chuttersnap\n",

            "claim [Claim]: The WHO has not labelled coronavirus a plague and the virus has not killed 75,000 people\n",
            "[Evidences]:The Statement As cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus continue to climb, information on the number of people infected and the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) response to the outbreak continues to spread on social media. An Instagram post from January 31, 2020 features a claim that WHO has called the coronavirus “a plague and it has infected an estimated 340,000 people in China and killed 75,000. The post’s text reads, “BREAKING: World Health Organization officially declares the Coronavirus as a plague, as [sic] estimated 340,000 people are infected in China and 75,000 dead”. The text is overlaid onto an image of an intravenous drip bottle hanging from a stand. The post has been viewed more than 30,000 times and has attracted more than 1700 likes and 100 comments. An Instagram post inflates infection and death numbers from the coronavirus outbreak and falsely claims the World Health Organisation has declared the disease “a plague”. The Analysis The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family – a group of viruses which also the SARS and MERS respiratory infections. Coronaviruses can be transmitted between animals and humans. According to the WHO, plague is a specific infectious disease caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis. The bacteria is usually found in small mammals and their fleas and can be transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissue or inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. Professor Basil Donovan , an expert on infectious diseases at the University of NSW Faculty of Medicine, told AAP FactCheck the word “plague” could also mean a very large outbreak or an epidemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the 2019 coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency. “It’s not a formally defined term. The trouble with wordplay, it’s got an emotional overlay. It has no meaning in medicine,” Professor Donovan said. “It’s not a scientific term. It’s good for clickbait. It doesn’t add any meaning to anything.” On January 30, 2020, the WHO convened its Emergency Committee to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) over the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO signifies “ an extraordinary event ” that requires a coordinated international response. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the main reason for the declaration is “ not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries ”. “Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with this,” he said. The post also claims 340,000 people are infected and 75,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus in China. According to the latest WHO coronavirus update on February 3 , 2020, there have been  17,391 confirmed cases globally with 17,238 confirmed cases in China. The WHO have also confirmed 361 deaths from the coronavirus outbreak within China and one death outside China, in the Philippines. The latest figures from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NHC) reported at 3am (AEST) on February 4, 2020 that 20,438 cases had been confirmed in the country. (use English translation) According to the Wuhan Coronavirus Global Cases reporting tool created by Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering , the tally of confirmed cases on mainland China stood at 20,001 with 426 confirmed deaths as of 12pm (AEST) February 4, 2020. All three sources put the total tally for people infected in China well under the figure of 340,000 claimed in the Instagram post. The Instagram user who posted the January 31 post shared an identical image on January 29, 2020, with that post’s caption including the word, “Cap”. According to dictionary.com’s slang dictionary , “cap” comes from the slang expression “no cap” which means “no lie” or “for real” to “emphasise someone is not exaggerating about something hard to believe”. Urban Dictionary also defines “That’s cap” as a term used for when someone’s actions are “unexceptional” or “fake”. The original post appears to have been posted on a Twitter account. AAP FactCheck searched Twitter using the Advanced Search tool for the phrase but could not locate the original tweet. The Verdict Based on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Instagram post to be false. While the WHO has declared the 2019 coronavirus outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, it has not deemed the outbreak as a “plague”. Also the number of infections and deaths globally are far below the numbers claimed in the post. Although the Instagram user labelled the claim in their first upload with “cap”, potentially indicating the post was false, many users appear unaware the post contains false information.

            "claim [Claim]: An Arizona family preparing for a swim found several rattlesnakes hiding inside two pool noodles stored near their home.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In late June 2018, a number of media sources relayed a warning from the City of Buckeye (Arizona) Fire Department to the effect that residents should watch for rattlesnakes hiding in pool noodles (long, cylindrical pool toys, usually hollow, made of polyethylene foam). According to USA Today, the warning — which was issued on Facebook— was based on a report the fire department received from a local resident: Fire department officials in Buckeye, Ariz., warned on Facebook of the reptiles hiding inside pool noodles following a citizen’s report claiming they discovered rattlesnakes and babies when they broke out the toy for use in the pool. The department said following some research, they found reports of other types of snakes laying eggs inside the pool noodle or nearby pool noodles left outdoors near bushes or block fences. “If you come into contact with a rattlesnake, or any other type of snake, stay calm,” said the department. The Facebook alert was postedon 23 June 2018, and was later edited to clarify a confusing statement suggesting that rattlesnake eggs had been found in a pool noodle (rattlesnakesdon’t lay eggs): POOL NOODLE ALERT!!! This story was passed on by one of our citizens- Watch where you store your pool noodles when they are not in use. Apparently, 2 pool noodles were left outside of the pool up against their cinderblock wall. The next time they went to use the pool, the pool noodles were picked up and brought to the swimming pool. Out popped a rattlesnake. The snake did not attack, but was concerned about the pool noodles as there were a couple of young rattlesnakes who were still inside the pool noodle.. After some research, we found that there have been reports of snakes (NOT RATTLESNAKES — they do not lay eggs) actually laying their eggs inside the pool noodle itself or around pool noodles that have been left outdoors near bushes or block fences. If you come into contact with a rattlesnake, or any other type of snake, stay calm. One of the worst things you can do when coming across a rattlesnake is to start panicking. Snakes rely on vibrations in the ground to determine where you are. If you start moving fast and abruptly, you’ll only scare the snake more. If you’ve seen the snake before you came across it, give it a lot of space. You can easily walk around it without frightening it. Just keep in mind that rattlesnakes can coil up and strike at great lengths, so give it as much space as possible. If the first indication of a rattlesnake’s presence is the sound of its rattle, you’ve already startled it. Instead of running, stay still. Chances are, the snake will stop rattling and slither off after it has calmed down. Humans are much bigger than snakes, so they don’t see any benefit in biting if it doesn’t need to protect itself. They’ll more than likely slither away to safety on their own. If you have any questions relating to snakes and their behaviors, please contact Rattlesnake Solutions at 480-237-9975. They have some great tips and advice. It was unclear whether the entire post was written by someone at the fire department, however, or parts of it were simply copied from the message passed along to them. It was also unclear whether firefighters had personally investigated and verified the details of the incident. (We reached out to the City of Buckeye Fire Department for clarification on these points but did not hear back by publication time.) Rattlesnake experts interviewed by various news venues seemed to find it plausible that rattlesnakes would seek refuge from extremely hot weather inside pool noodles, though none cited specific instances of it having occurred before. There is evidence that other kinds of snakes have been found in or near pool noodles, including a photo posted on the fire department’s Facebook page showing what appears to be a harmless water snake under one of the pool toys: We also found a YouTube video uploaded in May 2018, which shows a snake (though it does not appear to be a rattler) being shaken out of a pool noodle: There are some aspects of the story that seem a little bit fishy, like a “very large” rattlesnake being in a space only a little larger than an inch in diameter, and the report of other snakes being in there, too. If it were mid-July, I can see how a rattlesnake could possibly be giving birth to other rattlesnakes in something like a pool noodle, but this early in the year, it’s very unlikely. I have personally found a mother Western Diamondback Rattlesnake with her newborn babies in pool toys several times, but if you do as the items above suggest, it shouldn’t be something to worry about at your house. Hughes’s safety suggestions included storing pool toys well off the ground or in a box, and installing snake fencing to keep snakes away from the pool in general. We asked Hughes how worried people ought to be, realistically, about encountering rattlesnakes in their pool noodles. He told us: We do often find rattlesnakes at homes near pool toys and other pool equipment, including pool noodles. They are not attracted to the pool noodles, though, but to the moisture and cool shelter that is provided when pool toys are stored improperly on the ground or against a wall. During the hottest times of year, rattlesnakes estivate and seek out cool conditions where they can wait out the heat until monsoonal weather brings rain. Home owners should be cautious and avoid creating such conditions that rattlesnakes could find attractive. While snakes can crawl into the opening of a pool noodle, it’s something that should not be considered a serious threat and there is nothing in particular about a pool noodle that will attract rattlesnakes. We have been advising that home owners focus on overall prevention measures, like habitat reduction and rattlesnake fencing, and not to worry about their pool noodles and enjoy their pools as they always have.\n",

            "claim [Claim]: Screenshots that surfaced online in early October 2021 authentically show photographs of, or comments written by, the Zodiac killer.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In early October 2021, a group of private investigators announced it had evidence that a California man who died several years prior was the Zodiac Killer. Despite the lack of confirmation from law enforcement authorities on the veracity of that belief, the revelation sparked news stories, as well as makeshift investigations by social media users into the man’s life before his death. In short, popular tweets and Reddit threads made numerous allegations, such as the Zodiac killer was a Lady Gaga fan;trolled serial killer Ted Bundyonline; supported the Minnesota Vikings’ NFL team; and had a friend who wanted the world to know about his murderous past. Numerous Snopes readers sent us requests, or searched our site, for truth behind those rumors — as well as reliable information on whether the 52-year-old mystery was indeed solved. The rumors were fueled by the work of the “Case Breakers” — a group of roughly 40 former law enforcement officers, prosecutors, journalists, and intelligence officials who aim to solve murder cases. After supposedly comparing photographs to a police sketch, analyzing anagrams, and interviewing witnesses, the Case Breakers in early October released the name of the man who they believed terrorized northern California in the late 1960s as the Zodiac. Some media outlets, such as Fox News and Deadline, published stories identifying the man. “I absolutely feel we solved this case,” Tom Colbert, a member of the group, told the San Francisco Chronicle. “There’s no ego here,” he continued. “We do this to solve cases.” The Chronicle’s newsroom, as well as police, get hundreds of tips every year on potential Zodiac suspects and solutions to the case, according to the newspaper. For instance, a team led by a former California Highway Patrol Officer announced in 2011 that it believed a 91-year-old former real estate agent was responsible for the slayings; however, investigators said there wasn’t enough evidence to substantiate the theory. Cue the Case Breakers’ October 2021 announcement. Inaddition to five killingsin 1968 and 1969 in the Bay Area (murders that the FBIhas conclusively linked to the Zodiac), the Case Breakers believe the serial killer also murdered Cheri Jo Bates, an 18-year-old woman slain hours away in Southern California’s Riverside in 1966. However, Riverside Police Officer Ryan Railsback debunked that theory in an interview with the Chronicle.“If you read what they (the Case Breakers) put out, it’s all circumstantial evidence. It’s not a whole lot,” Railsback told that newspaper. In fact, federal and local investigators tasked with solving the Zodiac case aren’t sold on any of the private team’s findings; they say the search to find the Zodiac remains ongoing. “Sources at both agencies [the FBI and San Francisco Police Department] told The Chronicle the evidence presented by the Case Breakers does not appear to be conclusive,” the newspaper reported. Furthermore, San Francisco’s FBI bureau tweetedon Oct. 7: When we reached out to the FBI ourselves, its communications team referred us to the above-displayed tweet. Snopes also contacted the San Francisco Police Department, and a spokesperson responded via email:“The SFPD’s investigation into the Zodiac case is open and ongoing. As a consequence we cannot comment further on the investigation.” Because the agencies consider the case ongoing, Snopes is not naming the man who the Case Breakers believes was the Zodiac — apparently an Air Force veteran who died in 2018. For the purpose of this report, we will call him “the Case Breakers’ man.” He lived in the Sierra foothills and died at the age of 80, according to the Chronicle, which cited court records. Journalists with that newspaper reportedly spoke with a relative of the man six years before the Case Breakers’ October 2021 announcement. Also, they talked to the man’s daughter-in-law on Oct. 6, and she said that she believes the Case Breakers “nailed the killer.” The Chronicle published: The Chronicle was called six years ago by a relative of the Case Breakers suspect, who said the man lived in Groveland (Tuolumne County) and had tried to kill him with a hammer. He contacted investigators, but when The Chronicle followed up with law enforcement, they said the Zodiac connection did not appear to be there. The Groveland man’s former daughter-in-law told The Chronicle on Wednesday that she was intimately familiar with the other relative’s fears, and she believes the Case Breakers have nailed the killer. She lives out of state and said she moved to get away from threats from the man and his supporters. The Case Breakers suspect died in 2018 of natural causes, she said. County records show he was 80. “It’s my birthday today, and this all coming out is a great birthday present for me,” said Michelle Wynn, 52. The Case Breakers suspect “is the Zodiac, without a doubt. Being around him, knowing his demeanor and his shadiness and twistedness — I have an intuition, I can read people.” Wynn said the 1969 police sketch “was like a bell-ringer for me. … I saw that and thought, ‘That’s him.’ Totally,” she said. In short, while a team of private investigators claimed to have identified the Zodiac and a relative of that man reportedly told journalists that she believed he was “the Zodiac without a doubt,” federal and local law enforcement agencies including the FBI have not confirmed — nor given any indication — that that was indeed true. Additionally, critics of the Case Breakers’ findings includeMichael Hobbes, of the Huffington Post and the podcast, “You’re Wrong About,” and Jay Barmann, a writer for SF News. After some news reports published the full name of the Case Breakers’ man, Twitter did what Twitter does best — ragtag sleuthing and meme-ing. On Oct. 8, Barstool Sportscompiled a sample of theories circulating widely about the man under the headline, “Alleged Zodiac Killer Had Ironic Internet Presence.” That piece cited viral tweets claiming the following: that the Zodiac had supposedly left a glowing reviewof Lady Gaga’s 2016 “Joanne” album onmetacritic.com; trolled Ted Bundy in a review on an IMDb page; and had a friend who repeatedly outed him as the person behind the brutal slayings on social media. Let us start with the assertion that the serial killer was among Gaga’s Little Monsters. The Barstool Sports’ piece included a tweet supposedly showing screenshots of the Case Breakers’ man leaving a comment on the metacritic.com profile of “Joanne,” on Oct. 24, 2016, reading:“A national treasure, like myself.” However, we analyzed thousands of reviews on the album’s profile, including those published on Oct. 24, 2016, and found no such remark. The screenshot appeared to be a digital creation. Over the course of hours, other Twitter users meme-afied the concept with similarly edited images, supposedly showing the man’s affinity for various video games, bands, and musical artists. The claim about the 2015 documentary titled “The Hunt for Ted Bundy” seemed to be the same thing: An unknown digital artist apparently replicated the look and design of an IDMb review to make it seem like the Case Breaker man left the review, “Awful. Would give less than 1 star if I could. Ted Bundy is wildly overrated.” We came to that conclusion by studying the documentary’s actual IMDb page, which only had one review and was not the phrases pictured above. Next, we addressedthe rumor about a friend to the Case Breakers’ man “trying to tell everyone” about his murderous past. There was no verified evidence to prove the friend was a real person who knew the Case Breakers’ man, and/or that he had authored the alleged posts about the Zodiac. If there was any reason to consider their authenticity, journalists with reputable news outlets, such as the Chronicle, would attempt to interview the purported friend. That had not happened, as of this writing, however. We reached out the viral tweet’s author to learn how, or with what evidence, they obtained photographs supposedly showing the Case Breakers’ man and the friend, as well as screenshots of the friend supposedly calling the former man the Zodiac. We haven’t heard back, but we will update this report if that changes. Additionally, tweets and Reddit threads circulated photos of someone who they believed was the Case Breakers’ manwearing a hat representing the Minnesota Vikings NFL team. Several sports blogs recirculated that allegation, too. “The man allegedly outed as the Zodiac Killer was a Vikings fan,” a Reddit post read. However, no evidence proved that the man pictured above in a Vikings hat was the same person as the Case Breakers’ man. The picture matched the profile photograph for a Facebook account with the same name, however — an account that had little activity viewable to the public aside from a July 2011 post sharing a Washington Post article about Casey Anthony. All of this said, it was impossible for social media users’ investigations into the Case Breakers’ man to prove anything about the Zodiac killer — that he was a Lady Gaga fan, Viking’s supporter, Bundy troll, etc. — because federal and local investigators tasked with solving the case refuted the private team’s work, and considered the person behind the prolific slayings unknown. For that reason, we rate this claim “False.” Sources: Casiano, Louis. “Cold Case Team Says Zodiac Killer ID’d, Linking Him to Another Murder.” Fox News, 4 Oct. 2021, https://www.foxnews.com/us/cold-case-zodiac-killer-identified-murder.

            "claim [Claim]: The 1816 death of Gouverneur Morris, a signer of the Constitution, was caused by an infection after his urinary blockage was treated with a whalebone catheter.\n",
            "[Evidences]:In May 2022, the world reacted to a leaked draft opinion showing that the U.S. Supreme Court had provisionally voted to overturn the abortion protections in Roe v, Wade. As part of that fallout, attention turned to the U.S. Constitution and originalism — the principle that the Constitution should be read and understood with deference to the meanings and contexts that applied at the time the Founders created the text. An intriguing challenge to that principle emerged in a series of tweets posted on May 4 by @FanSince09 — an anonymous but prominent Philadelphia sports and cultural commentator — about the achievements, and grave errors, of Gouverneur Morris. The tweets, which contain sweary descriptions of an intimate male injury, read: Gouverneur Morris, who wrote the final draft of the constitution, died because he put a whale bone up his dick. I think it’s OK to edit the document. This is 100% true. He had a urinary blockage and [thought] the best idea would be to shove a whale bone up there to clear it out. The founding fathers were dopes – change that document as much as humanly possible. Whenever you see the [preamble] of the constitution remember that the man who wrote it then went home and put a whalebone up his dickhole. Also I need to clarify that Morris was one of the better founding fathers. He was a vocal abolitionist who spoke out against the south’s power, wanted to [secede] bc he felt the war of 1812 was an [attempt] by slave states to expand their territory. The point is that when we [concede] to the “wisdom of the founding fathers” we’re [conceding] to the wisdom of guys who gave themselves whalebone catheters. We know more now. Much of this account was accurate. Morris was indeed an important, though often overlooked, Founder. He spoke prolifically at the Constitutional Convention, and played a key role in finalizing the style and wording of the text, especially the famous opening words of the preamble, “We, the people of the United States …” He was also a firm opponent of slavery. And we know for a fact that he suffered for many years from what he described as “suppression of urine” caused by a “stricture” or blockage in his urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body, during urination. We also know that whalebone was vastly more widely used in the early 19th century than it is now, and was at times used specifically as a urethral catheter — a medical device for widening a blocked passage. So the claim that Morris died as a result of an infection caused by the insertion of a whalebone catheter into his penis was plausible. However, it was not very well-supported by the available evidence. In fact, the “whalebone catheter” claim stems entirely from one letter written by a friend of Morris, who does not explain the source of the purported knowledge. We could find no firsthand or family corroboration for the claim. In brief, it could well be true, but we can’t say for certain. Thus, our rating is “Unproven.” Born at his family’s estate, Morrisonia, in what is now the Bronx, New York, in 1752, Morris was a lawyer who took part in the New York provincial congress, the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, contributing heavily to debates over the substance of the Constitution, as well as the wording of its text. Having moved to Philadelphia, he signed the Constitution in 1787, in his capacity as a delegate from Pennsylvania. Under President George Washington, Morris served as the U.S. ambassador to France during the French Revolution in the 1790s. After returning home, he served one term as a U.S. senator for New York, from 1800 to 1803. On Nov. 6, 1816, at the age of 64, Morris died at Morrisonia, in the same room in which he was born. A contemporary news report offered no details on the manner of his passing, but described it as having followed a “short but distressing illness.” The day before Morris died, his friend Rufus King, himself a Massachusetts delegate to the Constitutional Convention, wrote to their mutual friend, the former diplomat Christopher Gore, and described Morris’ medical woes in (somewhat unpleasant) detail: We are like to lose, if we have not already lost, one of our distinguished citizens. Mr. Gouverneur Morris was not expected to live thro’ yesterday. He has been long subject to a stricture in the urinary Passage; and having unskilfully forced a piece of whale bone thro’ the Canal so lacerated the parts, as to create a very high degree of inflammation, which has been followed by a mortification that I am told will prove fatal. Some years ago, and in the interior of our State [New York], he performed the same operation with a flexible piece of hickory; the success on this occasion probably emboldened him to repeat the experiment, that is now to prove fatal… King’s letter is the sole source of the claim that Morris’ death was caused or hastened by an infection from a whalebone catheter. Unfortunately, he did not specify his sources, so we cannot pursue that line of inquiry any further. Morris himself was an avid diarist, and made several references over the years to his urinary problems. For example, as early as July 1789, he described how his doctor, a Dr. MacDonald, gave him a prescription for a stomach complaint, but was concerned it might have a negative effect on his “stricture.” “I am determined, however, to risk the consequences,” wrote Morris. Five years later, in December 1794, while visiting the German city of Hamburg, Morris wrote: Stay at Home this Afternoon much indisposed. Inflammation in the Urethra and Suppression of Urine which require Rest and Attention. In January 1809, while travelling from upstate New York to Morrisania, Morris stopped off at Schenectady, where he described being struck by a urinary blockage so severe that he wrote his will: Prepared to set off after Breakfast I am arrested by Suppression of Urine from Stricture in the Urethra which is more than usually alarming — Send for a Physician and make my Will. Work thro’ the Day with Difficulty. Melanie Randolph Miller — an author, expert on Morris, and editor of his diaries — has speculated that this 1809 episode may have been the occasion on which Morris treated his urinary blockage with a hickory catheter, as described years later by King. However, the diaries do not make that clear. Similarly, Morris made no reference to any urinary problems or a catheter, and no reference to whalebone whatsoever, in the lead-up to his death in November 1816. His diary made various terse and ambiguous references to illness — “Indisposed,” “Fatigued,” “health not restored,” and so on — and on Sept. 10 he specified that he had suffered a “pain on the right Side of my Head and Face,” while on Oct. 2 he wrote, “Indisposed for several days with diarrhea.” Other than those examples, his diary offers no clues as to what caused his death, and he stopped writing in it on Oct. 19, more than two weeks before he died.

            "claim [Claim]: \"Nigeria's doctor-to-population ratio falls far short of the WHO recommended doctor-to-population ratio of 1:600.\"\n",
            "[Evidences]:The Nigeria Medical Association president overestimated by around double the number of doctors who left the country between 2016 and 2018 but was mostly correct about the very small percentage of the world's health workers who work in sub-Saharan Africa. The doctor-to-population ratio in Nigeria is even worse than claimed, at one doctor to every 5,400 people, not between 4,000 and 5,000. The World Health Organization doesn't prescribe a minimum ratio for doctor to population. The NMA president was also incorrect that as much as 24% of the global burden of disease falls to Africa. More than 9,000 medical doctors of Nigerian origin have left the country for greener pastures in the UK, United States and Canada, according to a leading obstetrician and gynaecological surgeon. The exodus was between 2016 and 2018, Prof Innocent Ujah said , according to an April 2022 report in the Vanguard , a national newspaper. This figure has been widely repeated in subsequent months by other publications . Ujah, who is the president of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) , said this was negatively affecting the country's health systems . In this report, we checked five claims he made, including on healthcare worker numbers and the continent's burden of disease. The NMA's publicity secretary, Dr Aniekeme Uwah , confirmed Ujah was accurately quoted. But he didn't share any evidence for the claims. The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria , which regulates the professions of medicine, dentistry, and alternative medicine, acknowledged our request for data but had yet to respond at time of writing. We then contacted the medical registries in the UK, United States and Canada to help us evaluate this claim. From 2016 to 2018, 1,600 doctors with a primary medical qualification from Nigeria joined the UK register for the first time with a licence to practise, the General Medical Council told us . \"Please note that where a doctor gained their primary medical qualification is not a definitive indication of their nationality,\" a spokesperson said. The Federation of State Medical Boards supports state medical boards in the US in licensing, disciplining and regulating doctors and other healthcare professionals. Between 2016 and 2018 1,112 Nigeria-educated doctors were issued a total of 1,659 licences, Xiaomei Pei, a research and data integration manager at the federation, told Africa Check. Of these, 80% (887) were actively practising in the US as of 2018. Pei said that as of 2018, 3,708 Nigeria-educated doctors, with a total of 5,926 full active licences, were practising in the US. The Canada Medical Association was yet to respond on how many Nigerian-trained doctors migrated to the country in this period. But in a February 2022 report in Nigerian national newspaper Punch , the association said no fewer than 632 Nigeria-trained doctors were practising in Canada as of 2020. The numbers we have seen are less than half of the NMA president's claim. But in the absence of definitive data from Canada, and details about nationality, we rate this claim as unproven. The statement was from a 2010 document , the World Health Organization (WHO) told Africa Check. \"We would suggest considering these [numbers] out of date,\" a spokesperson said. The international health agency said the latest global and regional estimates were in the World Health Statistics 2021 report. According to the report, in 2018 the density of medical doctors per 10,000 people in the African region was 2.8 . That of nurses and midwives was 10.3 . The report did not have data on pharmacists and dentists. The WHO counts 47 countries in its Africa region. Globally, the density of medical doctors, nursing and midwifery personnel was 56.5 per 10,000 population. What figures from independent research show For a definitive figure of the region's health workers, we turned to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The IHME is an independent global health research centre at the University of Washington in the US. It works with partners around the world to develop scientifically valid evidence on the global state of health. Ally Walker, an IHME spokesperson, told Africa Check that it was estimated that sub-Saharan Africa had about 3.6% of the world's health workers . \"The percentage of health workers is taken from our health workers density covariate and our population estimates,\" Walker said. ( Note: For more on covariates, read here or here . ) Walker confirmed the IHME counted health workers of any speciality. This included doctors, nurses, midwives, and dentistry and pharmaceutical professionals. The data informing this claim was also outdated, the WHO told Africa Check Data from the IHME's global burden of disease study published in The Lancet journal shows the health challenges facing people across the world. Its latest data is for 2019 and covers 204 countries, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors. From the study \"sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 20.1 % of the global burden of disease\", the IHME's Ally Walker told Africa Check. She said numbers for this were taken directly from the global number of disability-adjusted life years. (Note: Disability-adjusted life years is the summary measure of health combining both morbidity and mortality, as an outcome instead of specific disease incidence or mortality .) Africa Check has previously investigated a similar claim . In April 2019 the Nigeria Medical Association said there were 40,000 doctors taking care of 200 million people in the country. This amounted to a ratio of one doctor to about 5,000 people. The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria had earlier that year said 39,912 doctors were registered with it as of December 2017. This was in response to a freedom of information request by news publisher Premium Times. We have not seen any more recent data from the regulator. Nigeria's most recent population estimates show there are significantly more people. The UN Population Fund estimated the population to be 216.7 million in 2022. This works out to a ratio of nearly one doctor for 5,400 people. A digital population census was supposed to start in May 2022, but it didn't . The available data shows Ujah's estimate is conservative and that every doctor in Nigeria has to care for even more people. The World Health Organization has said it does not prescribe or recommend any ideal ratio. This, a spokesperson has previously told Africa Check , was because there wasn't a simple answer or one-size-fits-all solution. Dr Mathieu Boniol, a statistician at the WHO , previously told Africa Check that \"a country's number of healthcare workers should be adapted to its needs and the characteristics of its national health labour market\".\n",

Rahul Gandhi and members of the Congress party, as part of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, have met locals and leaders alike as they move from city to city on foot. Of the many, many photos from the road, one shows Gandhi posing with a young woman. The Congress leader was giving her a side-hug. This photo has been widely shared with some questionable claims. They alleged that the woman in the photo is Amulya Leona Noronha, a student who chanted “Pakistan Zindabad” during an anti-CAA rally, while sharing the stage with MP Asaduddin Owaisi in February 2020. People shared the photo with captions like, \"Remember her who said Pak Zindabad, you can see her with Pappu in Bharat Todo Yatra.\" The Archived version of one such post can be seen here . It was tweeted by Bharatiya Janata Party leader Priti Gandhi, who said, \"Look carefully. Not Bharat Jodo, this is Bharat Todo!\" She later deleted the tweet.

AFWA Probe We noticed tweets in responses to such tweets claiming that the woman in the photo was Miva Andreleo. We searched for Miva Andreleo and found her social media accounts. On her Instagram, she shared the same photo of herself with Rahul Gandhi. A comparison between both makes it easy to understand that both are the same. Who is Miva Andreleo? As her profile mentioned, Andreleo is a member of the Kerala Students Union (KSU). She also works for the Congress party. She also posted a video of her meeting Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra in Kerala. Therefore, it is clear that the woman seen with Rahul Gandi is not Amulya Leona Noronha, but Miva Andreleo, a student leader from Kerala. --- ENDS --- INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim During the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi was seen with Amulya Leona Noronha, the woman who was arrested for saying 'Pakistan Zindabad' during an anti-CAA rally in 2020. Conclusion This is not Amulya Leona. The woman seen with Rahul Gandhi is Miva Andreleo of the Kerala Students Union (KSU).
